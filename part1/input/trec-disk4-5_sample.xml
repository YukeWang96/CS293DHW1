Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the Mexican government's peace envoy in the southern
state of Chiapas, has indicated he might run for national office if the
government did not approve democratic reforms under discussion for the
country and failed to comply with the recent peace accord for the rebels in
Chiapas.
He thereby resisted rising pressure from his colleagues in the governing
party to rule himself out of the presidential race.
The party's 65-year hold on power could be jeopardised if Mr Camacho, a
former mayor of Mexico City and an ex-foreign minister, were to realise his
veiled threat to run as an opposition candidate in the presidential election
in August.
'If there are no advances in democracy and if, instead of accord, there is
polarisation and if anyone wants to trample on my political rights as a
citizen, then after I have fulfilled my mission in Chiapas, I will take the
necessary political decision to bring democracy and unity to Mexico,' Mr
Camacho told reporters.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Support for S American free trade area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Brazil's proposal to create a South American free trade area has won the
backing of the country's three partners in Mercosur, the regional common
market planned to come into effect next year.
Brazil and its partners Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay agreed last week to
begin negotiating the proposal with other countries in the second half of
this year, after final arrangements for Mercosur are agreed.
Mr Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, responsible for Mercosur at the Brazilian
foreign ministry, said the idea for the free trade area, first suggested
last year, is an extension of Mercosur and designed to increase trade in the
continent: 'This should be seen as a further trade liberalisation move to
make South America eventually ready for some kind of convergency with an
expanded North American Free Trade Agreement.'
The free trade area is expected to go into effect over ten years from 1995.
It will be defined to cover 'substantially all' goods, or at least 80 per
cent of trade. Unlike Mercosur, the area would aim to create a customs
union, although some countries may be invited to join Mercosur at a later
stage.
Mr Denot Medeiros said the proposal was not designed as a response or
competitor to Nafta. Brazil believes the two entities could be complementary
and that some countries could be members of both. Chile, expected to be the
next invited to join Nafta, would also be an important member of the South
American area, he said.
Brazil's idea has received so far only a lukewarm response from other South
American countries. Some were awaiting a formal decision on whether to
proceed from the four Mercosur countries.
There have also been occasionally confusing signals from Argentina on its
commitment to Mercosur, after disagreement with Brazil over the rate of
common external tariffs to be applied. Tariffs on about 85 per cent of goods
have already been agreed and the two countries have until June to agree
tariffs on the remainder.

FT  14 MAR 94 / US and Europe reach rare consensus: All agree on need for
greater labour flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual consensus has emerged - at least between the US and Europe - from
the dozens of papers produced by governments and think-tanks for the Group
of Seven jobs summit, which is to begin in Detroit today, even if there has
been no new big idea for solving the developed world's unemployment problem.
The three main voices in the debate - the US, the UK and the continental
European - backed by economists at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, are all emphasising a combination of greater
labour market flexibility, easier enterprise formation, more effective
active labour market measures and improvements in education and training.
There is even a broad consensus around one of the central causes of
unemployment in the developed world: that a combination of trade with
developing countries and technological change has permanently reduced demand
for less-skilled labour. Benefit systems and minimum wages put a floor under
unskilled wages in Europe, so the fall in demand has shown in rising
unemployment. In the US, on the other hand, the problem is expressed in
falling wages or resort to crime.
The policy challenge is to move as many people as possible into high-skill
jobs, while ensuring that labour markets are flexible enough to soak up the
rest without forcing down incomes too far. By their attendance at the
summit, all G7 countries implicitly accept that social engineering to deal
with this collapse in demand for unskilled labour, and to cut the time lag
between the destruction of old jobs and the creation of new ones, is
justified.
In political terms, both free-market liberals, represented most strongly by
the UK government, and social/Christian democrats, represented by
continental Europe and the European Commission, can sign to such a
combination of ideas. A Democratic administration in the US, interested in
European welfare and training systems but still wedded to many aspects of
its own flexible labour market, hovers between the two.
But the idea of mid-Atlantic convergence can also be misleading, because the
meeting point is far closer to the US than to the European coast. Indeed,
the starting point of the most influential analysis is considerably more
liberal and competitiveness-conscious than a decade ago.
The emphasis in Europe is on repairing the poor capacity of its economies to
create new jobs. In the US, which has produced 2m new jobs in the past 18
months, the emphasis is on producing higher-skilled, higher-paid jobs.
All the main parties to the debate, including the traditionally orthodox
OECD, are also careful to avoid advocating US-style wage differentials, and
real wage cuts (in 1972-1992 US average real wages fell by about 10 per
cent). Even the UK government, the strongest admirer of the US model, talks
about the balance to be struck between market forces and regulation.
The main clusters of ideas on the Detroit agenda are:
Wage and regulatory flexibility. The OECD has long advocated that Europe
increase its labour cost flexibility and reform its job security provisions.
The most surprising recent convert to this orthodoxy has been the European
Commission. The European Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness
and Employment, published at the end of last year, talks about a new
solidarity between the employed and the unemployed, and about 'remodelled'
regulation rather than de-regulation. But it pulls few punches on the
problems of European rigidity. It says that many social protection schemes
and wage bargaining systems have had a negative impact on employment,
protecting those in work at the expense of job-seekers, and says that there
is broad consensus from member states on the need for greater flexibility
and lower labour costs.
The most concrete policy proposal to create more jobs for the less skilled
and increase the 'employment-intensity' of the services sector is to
increase the burden of non-wage labour costs as incomes rise. At present,
the proportion falls as incomes rise in most European countries.
The US paper circulated to governments before the summit also stresses that
the main policy requirement for Europe - and Japan - is to reduce
restrictions on wage setting and employment adjustment which reduce the
incentives of the unemployed to find jobs and the incentives of employers to
create them.
Training, education and good jobs. The US paper says that, in the right
climate of innovation and entrepreneurship, new technology creates as many
jobs as it destroys. But, if all citizens are to qualify for these jobs, the
standards of basic education and training must be improved, especially in
the US, and the school-to-work transition must be better handled.
Active labour markets and more flexible welfare. The annual cost of
unemployment in the EU - including foregone income - is more than Ecu200bn
(Pounds 151bn) each year, greater than the GDP of Belgium. In recent years,
there has been a small shift towards active labour market measures -
training, job placement, and so on - but more than two-thirds of direct
spending on unemployment still goes on passive measures.
The challenge is to find ways of boosting the incomes of the unskilled in a
more economically efficient manner than just leaving them on benefits. The
problem is that Europe's social security systems were designed on the
assumption of full-time employment and have failed to adapt to the growth of
part-time and 'atypical' employment. Individuals find it difficult to move
from unemployment into anything other than full-time work because of the
steep claw-back of benefits.
Disagreements and other views. There are, of course, differences of emphasis
between the main participants, with most European countries playing down
cyclical factors and playing up structural factors, while the US still
believes that a good part of the unemployment problem is linked to low
growth.
'Countries which pursue structural improvements, without taking steps to
increase aggregate demand, will see little or no return for their efforts,'
warns the US paper. Japan, with the best record of any G7 country on jobs in
recent years, also warns in its otherwise orthodox paper against too much
emphasis on labour flexibility. 'Excessive mobility of workers discourages
incentives to enhance human resource development by enterprises,' it warns.
One idea - not on the Detroit agenda - which runs strongly counter to
economic orthodoxy is work-sharing. The EU White Paper was ambivalent about
it, rejecting 'a generalised reduction in working hours and job-sharing at
national level'.
Even so, as a preferable alternative to widespread redundancies for
companies in short-term trouble, reduced working time will remain on the
broader agenda.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Looking forward to a plan in Naples

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finance and employment ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations gathered in Detroit last night for a two-day brainstorming session
on ways to tackle the persistent unemployment in their economies.
US officials hosting the jobs conference insist there will be no final
communique and no attempt at formal policy co-ordination, but President Bill
Clinton wants to use the conference's conclusions as the basis for the July
summit meeting of G7 leaders in Naples to agree a jobs plan.
For Mr Clinton, who will open the conference this morning, the meeting
offers a chance to focus on themes close to the heart of his administration,
after much distraction by the Whitewater affair.
Ministers from other G7 countries expect the Detroit meeting to agree on the
need for labour market flexibility, investment in education and training,
and open trade.
'We find we are talking from the same agenda,' said Mr David Hunt, UK
employment secretary.
Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
says the employment issue is of critical political importance for all the G7
countries.
But the seven nations are not unanimous on how big a role economic stimulus,
in the form of lower interest rates or tax cuts, should play in an overall
jobs policy.
US officials do not want to turn the Detroit meeting into a shouting match
with Germany's Bundesbank, but they continue to argue that Europe needs
further interest rate cuts to spur growth and job creation.
Ms Laura Tyson, chief White House economist, told the Financial Times that
she is yet to be convinced that Europe's unemployment problems can be as
much explained by structural problems, such as rigid labour market rules, as
her European counterparts argue.
'Between 1986 and 1990, the European G7 countries added about 5m jobs and
the unemployment rate went down from about 9 per cent to about 6.9 per cent.
Since 1990, the unemployment rate has gone up to about 9.2 per cent and the
level of employment has gone down by about 2m,' she noted.
"Unless you are willing to make the case that structural rigidities improved
a lot between 1986 and 1990, and then got worse again, a lot of that
deterioration has to be cyclical.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Lack of training shuts out poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When President Bill Clinton first called for a special conference to discuss
jobs and unemployment at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo last summer, the
US economy was still recovering only anaemically from the 1990 recession,
and unemployment stood at 7 per cent.
Today, as the conference convenes in Detroit, the jobless rate is 6.5 per
cent - despite a change in the method of calculation that makes the figure
higher than under the old system.
Comparing the US record with that of Europe, some US commentators have
sneered at the purpose of the conference.
'Actually, there is no global crisis; there is only a European crisis,'
scoffed Mr Robert Samuelson in the magazine Newsweek. 'We have nothing to
learn from the Europeans about job creation, and the lessons they could
learn from us are the obvious ones that - for political and social reasons -
they can't adopt.'
Clinton administration officials, however, have spent the last week telling
anyone who would listen that, on the contrary, they still have a great deal
to learn from them.
While the US has indeed had much more dynamic job creation than the other G7
countries, they note, real wages in the US have stagnated for years. At the
same time, income disparities between the better trained and educated and
the less well trained have widened dramatically. Whole segments of the
population have been virtually shut out of the job market, with unemployment
approaching 70 per cent in some cases, such as inner-city black teenagers.
'Others could learn from US flexibility and dynamism. We could learn from
what others have done to facilitate the transition from school to work,'
said Mr Larry Summers, the treasury undersecretary for international
affairs.
Looked at over a period of decades, the US has consistently created new jobs
at a strong pace. The number of non-farm jobs grew by an average of 2.2 per
cent a year from 1950 to 1990.
Unemployment, meanwhile, oscillated between 4.9 per cent and 9.7 per cent in
the 1970s and 1980s, much lower than comparable European rates - although
some workers may give up the search for work quicker than they might in
Europe, since US benefits stop after 26 weeks.
At the start of the 1990s, employment stagnated as recession was followed by
a slow recovery which seemed to bring few new jobs in its wake. Last year,
net job creation picked up to 1.8 per cent - more robust, but still weak by
the standards of most post-war recoveries.
A new study by economists Steven Davis, John Haltiwanger and Scott Schuh at
the Census Bureau's Centre for Economic Studies shows that the gross
creation and destruction of jobs that produces these net annual figures is
far more dramatic.
Looking at data from individual manufacturing plants from 1973 to 1988, they
found that in a typical 12-month period 10.3 per cent of jobs disappeared,
while another 9.1 per cent were newly created.
While US workers have been finding jobs, their earnings, adjusted for
inflation, have fared worse. Average weekly earnings in the private sector,
measured in 1982 dollars, climbed from Dollars 261.92 in 1960 to Dollars
315.38 in 1973. Since then, they have slipped back steadily to only Dollars
255.99 at the end of 1993.
Within this overall decline, workers in the highest wages bracket saw their
earnings rise by an average of 4.4 per cent in real terms over the last 20
years, while workers in the bottom wage bracket saw a real fall in earnings
of 10.3 per cent.
Another Census Bureau study published last week shows that 18 per cent of
America's 81m full-time workers earned less than a poverty level wage of
Dollars 13,091 a year, compared with only 12 per cent in 1979.
Some European countries, while they may not have escaped the erosion of real
wages, have avoided this increase in inequality.
This does not just mean that the superior record of job creation in the US
has come entirely in low-wage, low-skill sectors such as fast food
restaurants.
'The US economy has not been producing McJobs disproportionately,' says Ms
Laura Tyson, chair of the White House council of economic advisers. 'We have
been creating jobs in good job classification categories, but that rate of
growth of compensation of those jobs has slowed.'
Some of the pressure on earnings has come from the spiralling cost of health
insurance, which is provided in most cases by employers who generally pass
on around 80 per cent of the costs to their workers in lower wages.
But even measures of total compensation, including health benefits, have
grown at a rate the Clinton administration finds disappointing.
The question ministers will address today and tomorrow is, in the words of
Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary: 'Are the citizens of advanced
economies condemned to choose between, on the one hand, more jobs which pay
less and less, or good jobs but high levels of unemployment accompanying
those good jobs?
'I think there's a third choice, and that third choice may be to combine the
kind of investments in education and training and apprenticeship that we
find in Europe with the dynamic labour mobility and flexibility we find in
the US, all encased within macro-economic policies which encourage growth
and jobs.'

MADRID
Spain's Socialist government has found itself in a role it wanted badly to
avoid - as the villain of the piece, or as they say in Spanish 'the bad guy
in the film', over enlargement of the European Union. But by evoking
'national interests' it has ensured a broad front of support from the
country's press.
Most editorialists gave less importance to the wrangle with Norway over
fishing rights than Spain's demands for minority blocking votes in the
future 16-member EU. The leading Madrid daily El Pais described Spain's
decision to dig its heels in as 'unfortunate, but right'.
At stake was Spain's ability to prevent decisions on crucial issues being
imposed on it. The argument boiled down to 'a struggle to prevent Europe's
centre of gravity being definitively shifted northwards'. It recognised the
quandary this represented for Spain's ostensibly pro-European leaders.
'For some negotiators it is hard to resist the pressure and criticism from
friends, partners and allies. But in this instance there is no other way for
Spain, which favours enlargement, to defend interests of the first
magnitude.'
The right-wing daily ABC said the government's firmness was backed by all
political parties. But the government itelf was partly to blame for the
'terrible' way it negotiated Spain's entry eight years ago, leaving the
country 'in many sectors defenceless against a decision by Brussels.' As for
Norwegian cod, it hoped for 'a logical outcome which would cater for Spain's
legitimate demands without imposing intolerable conditions on Norway.'
The conservative Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia commented: 'Anyone
shocked by Spain's attitude should also be shocked by the attitude of those
opposing its demands.' Norway, it conceded, was 'perfectly entitled to
defend its interests.' The difference was that the Norwegians were on the
outside trying to get in.
PARIS
Air France's request for FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in state aid, and the fact
that it accounted for half the losses made by all the world's airlines last
year, occupied much space - but provoked relatively little editorial comment
 -in the French press.
One exception, however, was La Tribune, the business daily, which said that
some would find it 'scandalous that the French taxpayer was having to dig
into his pocket again' to save Air France, and Bull the computer company,
and others 'would reckon that the bills presented by the new bosses of these
companies were a bit steep, even indecent, at a time when private companies
were having to take the risk of going to the markets for new money'.
The distortion of competition was too flagrant not to be noticed, said La
Tribune in language that could have come - and undoubtedly will - out of a
British Airways press release on the Air France aid request.
But the real problem, La Tribune said, was that Air France and Bull had
simply always lived sheltered lives, protected from the market and winds of
competition. Their recent history was a tale of 'money lost, energies wasted
and employees disappointed'.
However, Ouest France, produced in Bordeaux but with the largest circulation
in France, struck a more upbeat note. Mr Christian Blanc, Air France's new
boss had a record of solving knotty problems like the New Caledonian crisis
in the 1980s, and other French companies like Citroen had been able to pull
themselves rapidly together. But it said Air France's problem was that it
essentially lacked a business culture, and 'that will not be settled by a
cheque'.
SANTIAGO
Weekend papers were glowing in their accounts of the presidential handover,
a 'fiesta of democracy' in which Eduardo Frei, in the words of La Nacion,
'arrived in Valparaiso (home to Congress) as a common citizen and returned
to Santiago as president'.
For the most part, editors forgot their political differences and treated
the event as pageant. This was, after all, as La Epoca pointed out, the
first time in nearly 25 years that power had been transferred from one
democratically elected president to another. The last time was in 1970 when
Eduardo Frei's father handed the presidential sash to Salvador Allende.
The man responsible for breaking that sequence, General Augusto Pinochet,
attended Frei's inauguration in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the
armed forces. According to El Mercurio, the general's entrance 'was received
with loud and prolonged applause'. La Epoca noticed that, after the
ceremony, the general did not exit through the front door, but left 'via the
car parks'.
There was much praise for outgoing president Patricio Aylwin, though an
opinion piece in La Tercera thought his government had not properly
administered 'what it had received from its (military) predecessor'.
El Mercurio said that - discounting financial scandal at state copper
company Codelco, and a lax attitude towards crime - Aylwin's presidency 'had
been one of the most auspicious in the country's history'. It hoped
President Frei, a fellow Christian Democrat, would show the same
'moderation'.
La Nacion was less cautious. In a piece headlined 'Four unforgettable years'
it said: 'The historical merit of Aylwin is that he taught us to live in a
democracy once again.' Now that Chileans were not fighting for basic
political freedoms, they could concentrate on social problems, it said.
'Four years ago, it was not like that.'

Shortly after the Nato attack order was rescinded, UN officials reported the
arrival of UN observation teams to Serb-besieged Maglaj.
Under attack by the Serbs since last June, the 19,000 residents of the
Moslem enclave in northern Bosnia have suffered great hardship, with all
land convoys blocked since last October. The latest development appeared to
represent a concession by the Serbs.
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur made a surprise visit to French UN
peacekeeping units in the Bihac pocket of northern Bosnia yesterday where
the French last week lost one of their men to Serb Shooting.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Slovaks worry about jobs as political battle rages: The
crisis as Meciar fights for survival after losing a parliamentary vote of
no-confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's beleaguered prime minister, begins what is
expected to be a long and bitter battle for his political survival today,
when he hands in his government's resignation.
Mr Meciar, who lost a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on Friday, has
already threatened to close down government by immediately pulling out all
his ministers.
While in theory a new government could be appointed within days, as is
clearly the hope of President Michal Kovac, disagreements within the
opposition and stalling tactics by Mr Meciar and his Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) could prolong the crisis.
Parliament must also approve a date for early elections - something it has
not been able to agree on until now. The next general election is not due
before 1996.
Mr Meciar - who is aware of conflicting interests within the opposition,
which ranges from the strongly christian KDH on the right to the reformed
communists in the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) - has also thrown the
cat among the pigeons by pushing for a general election in June.
This was rejected by parliament as impractical, but the opposition then
failed to muster enough support for its own motion calling for elections in
November. Deputies representing the Hungarian ethnic minority held back
support in the hope of winning concessions for more autonomy.
The SDL will now try again on Wednesday with another motion calling for
elections in September-October, but it is by no means guaranteed it will win
the 90 votes required in the 150-seat parliament. The opposition could
muster only 78 votes in support of its no-confidence motion.
The HZDS has also gathered more than the 350,000 signatures required for a
petition to force a referendum on holding early elections and dismissing
deputies who have switched party. If the petition is accepted as legitimate,
President Kovac must order a referendum within 30 days, but even so
elections are likely to be delayed.
'It could take months before the situation is resolved,' a senior Slovak
official said privately yesterday.
Such political uncertainty could not come at a worse time, with the country
facing serious economic difficulties that may require unpopular measures.
The economy remains deeply in recession, unemployment already at 15 per cent
of the workforce is rising fast, and there may be renewed pressures for a
devaluation.
None of this would make a transitional government very popular.
The problem is compounded by the lack of clear political alternatives.
Opposition to Mr Meciar has been as much over his authoritarian style of
governing as about policies. None of the opposition parties has come up with
a distinct political progamme for government, focusing instead on piecemeal
policies.
Slovakia became independent almost against its own wishes on January 1993,
having to build most of its institutions from scratch.
It was short of qualified personnel, and its politicians had no experience
of running an independent country.
This has made for highly personalised and unpredictable politics, such as
attempts to find a third way between capitalism and socialism, that have
since been abandoned but did not help the country's international image or
encourage foreign investment.
Meanwhile, the past two years' political infighting has alienated an
increasing number of Slovaks. According to recent polls, about half eligible
voters do not intend to vote or do not know what to vote for. Younger voters
are most disaffected, though dissatisfaction is widespread.
'They don't care, they're just interested in power,' says a young biology
student in Bratislava. A taxi driver berates the politicians' constant
wheeling and dealing and has no time for the parliament. 'It's bad for
business,' he says.
Even officials are down-hearted. 'There's a big gap between what the
government thinks and what the people think,' a provincial chief of police
says.
Less than two years after victory in the June 1992 elections, and over a
year after independence, Mr Meciar's popularity has declined to around 15
per cent in opinion polls. The government has been weakened by successive
rows and defections, culminating in the recent damaging public confrontation
with the president.
Independence has not brought the prosperity promised by politicians, though
it is now accepted as irreversible. People are more worried about jobs and
security, but with every new twist in the political crisis, the uncertainty
deepens and prospects of economic recovery become more remote.
'Whatever happens it's going to take time. It's a mess, and its going to get
worse before it gets better,' one diplomat said.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Envoys near critical stage in hunt for Bosnian peace: US and
Russia anxious to begin drawing up maps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Russia, now co-ordinating every move in the search for peace in
the former Yugoslavia, want to resolve one of the more intractable aspects
of a settlement for Bosnia: the maps.
After three days of negotiations in Vienna, Zagreb and Sarajevo, Mr Charles
Redman, the US special envoy, and Mr Vitaly Churkin, his Russian
counterpart, are reaching a critical stage in negotiations over Bosnia's
future.
US and UN officials said that if the Bosnian Serbs could not be brought on
board to join the complex federation of Bosnia's Moslems and Croats - the
draft constitution of which was agreed by the two former adversaries in
Vienna yesterday - then the Bosnian Serbs would have to decide whether to
cede land in return for peace.
Otherwise, they added, the Bosnian Serbs could find themselves in a 'limbo',
with their territory The search for a settlement intensified over the
weekend when:
General John Galvin, the former supreme commander of Nato, helped forge a
defence agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems leading to the
establishment of one Bosnian army. US officials stressed this would not
provide the means for a new offensive against the Bosnian Serbs. 'Its aim is
to stop the fighting between Croats and Moslems. It is also the first step
towards creation of a federation in one part of Bosnia,' a US official said.
After talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr Churkin said he would not
rule out Serb participation in the federation. Even Mr Momcilo Krajisnik,
speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' self-proclaimed parliament and an important
negotiator, said Serbs were willing to join peace talks or some some kind of
co-existence with Moslems and Croats within Bosnia.
In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb and Moslems said they had set up a preliminary
agreement to open up to civilian traffic routes in and out of the Bosnian
capital. This could be the beginning of the lifting of the siege, and an
eventual demilitarisation of the city.
Mr Churkin, who met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo
yesterday, will today hold talks with Serb leaders in Belgrade, the Serbian
capital. US officials said the talks could pave the way for an overall peace
settlement for Bosnia and Croatia.
Mr Churkin must establish today whether President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia is ready to sue for peace, which would lead to the lifting of
sanctions.
Any moves towards peace would require Belgrade persuading the Bosnian Serbs,
who hold nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia, to reduce their control to about 49
per cent.
During the Bosnian Croat and Moslem talks hosted by the US in Vienna, maps
have not been discussed for the federation as any decisions would have to
involve negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs.
Sections of the Bosnian Serb leadership are loath to cede any land. It would
mean breaking the fragile territorial corridors linking Serbs living in
Krajina, south-western Croatia, to Bosnian Serb territory, and ultimately to
Serbia proper.
'It is difficult to know if the links between Milosevic and the Krajina
Serbs are weaker than those between the Bosnian Serbs and Krajina,' a UN
negotiator said.
'Milosevic has to decide if he is prepared to weaken those links (with
Krajina) in return for sanctions being lifted; equally the Bosnian Serbs
must recognise they have no legitimacy as a self-proclaimed state if they do
not negotiate,' he added.
But the overriding consideration with regard to the status - and fate - of
the Krajina Serbs is the extent to which they can be used as pawns by
Belgrade in the hunt for a settlement with Croatia and Bosnia.
'The future status Krajina holds is the linchpin for peace between Croatia
and Serbia,' a UN peace negotiator said. 'Croatia wants full control of its
territory, including Krajina. But the Krajina Serbs do not want to live in
Croatia, regardless of pressure from Belgrade. They are the Achilles' heel.'
Despite this, Bosnian Serbs - and Mr Milosevic - continue to hold a strong
negotiating position. They can argue that the federation of Bosnian Croats
and Moslems will be linked to Croatia through a confederation, in effect
creating an eventual Greater Croatia and rewarding Croat gains in western
Hercegovina. Consequently they can ask why the Bosnian Serbs in eastern
Bosnian cannot link to Serbia proper.
'The answer is that the US wants to maintain a semblance of Bosnia's
territorial integrity. But we know that under a new guise, and with haggling
over the maps, Bosnia is already being carved up between Zagreb and
Belgrade,' a UN official said.

<TEXT>
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid an unannounced visit to French
troops serving with United Nations peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia
yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Balladur went first to Zagreb, Croatia, and was due to visit the Bihac
pocket in northern Bosnia, aides said.
He was accompanied by Defence Minister Francois Leotard on his visit to
units which came under Serb fire last week, when artillery rounds hit French
positions and a 22-year-old soldier was killed by a sniper.
French commanders are reported to be irate since a request they made for
Nato aircraft to strike back at the Serbs was turned down by UN commanders.
The Bihac pocket, where about 1,300 French troops are stationed, is a
Moslem-inhabited enclave surrounded by Serb troops.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Focus on the centre ground: Italian general elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Italy's general election enters its final two weeks, attention has
switched to the large, undecided vote caused by the collapse of the
traditional centrist grouping.
Polls published last week showed that neither of the two main alliances on
the right and left were capable of winning an absolute parliamentary
majority. This raises the spectre of the centre, composed of the reshuffled
remnants of the five parties that have governed post-war Italy, acting as
arbiters in the formation of the next government.
The polls, the last permitted before the election on March 27, also
suggested that the momentum had slowed behind media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement.
Mr Berlusconi himself suffered embarrassment over the weekend after his
younger brother Paolo admitted he had paid L1.3bn (Pounds 520,000) to
Socialist and Communist local councillors to secure a golf club development
at Basiglio near Milan. In connection with these payments, Milan magistrates
searched the home of Mr Alessandro Moneta, a former mayor of Basiglio and
currently southern Italy co-ordinator for Forza Italia.
According to a poll conducted by Directa, the Berlusconi-dominated
right-wing alliance would obtain 295 seats in the 630 lower house against
242 seats for the Progressive Alliance led by the former communist Party of
the Democratic Left (PDS).
The Directa poll - broadly endorsed by another conducted by Telemontecarlo -
indicated that the PDS will get a maximum of 135 seats in the chamber of
deputies with Reconstructed Communism, the hardline rump of the old
Communist party, winning up to 35 seats. The strength of Reconstructed
Communism and its damaging programme proposals, such as raising taxes on
government bonds, are imposing severe strains on the Progressive Alliance.
The centre parties, composed mainly of the former Christian Democrats
reformed under the Popular party (PPI) and referendum leader Mr Mario
Segni's Pact for Italy, would get 68. The remaining seats would go to the
small parties.
Seven former members of Italy's domestic intelligence service (Sisde) have
been sent for trial for allegedly embezzling L60bn following an
investigation by Rome magistrates lasting over nine months.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Brittan's book stirs debate on expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government faces renewed controversy over Europe today after the
premature release of a book by Sir Leon Brittan, in which the senior British
commissioner calls for a wide-ranging overhaul of decision-making in an
expanded European Union.
Sir Leon's views run counter to the UK's insistence on special protection
for the large member states which has led to deadlock in enlargement talks
with Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway.
His proposals for institutional reform are also likely to stir up Tory
Euro-sceptics worried that UK Prime Minister John Major's government may be
about drop its hard-line stand and adopt a more pro-European manifesto ahead
of European Parliament elections in June.
Mr Major was warned yesterday that any retreat from his insistence on
maintaining the present voting system after enlargement would provoke new
convulsions within the Conservative party. But with other EU states
threatening to block enlargement unless the threshold for a blocking
minority within the council was raised from the present 23 votes, British
ministers acknowledged the dilemma.
Both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, have been adamant
that the minority veto should not be diluted. The same point has been made
to Conservative party managers by Euro-sceptic MPs.
EU foreign ministers will attempt to rescue the enlargement talks at a
meeting tomorrow in Brussels. Spanish demands for access to 7,000 tonnes of
Norwegian cod appear likely to be accommodated after reports of a new offer
from Oslo; but hopes of settling the row over power-sharing rest on a
face-saving compromise which takes greater account of population.
Britain, supported by Spain, is pressing to maintain the present voting
arrangements which allow two large nations and a smaller country to block
their partners. Germany and other EU members want to raise the 'blocking
minority' threshold to 27 votes. One compromise under review is to increase
the blocking minority to 27 votes, on condition it would not apply if
countries representing more than 40 per cent of the population wanted to
hold up decisions.
Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, said in an interview with the El
Pais newspaper yesterday: 'I hope in the coming days we can find a formula
that will satisfy our legitimate aspirations.'
Friends of Sir Leon said last week that he was dismayed at the UK
government's apparent willingness to jeopardise enlargement, a goal
previously judged to be central to Britain's European policy.
The chief EU trade negotiator, who is a candidate to succeed Mr Jacques
Delors as president of the European Commission, argues in his book that
institutional reform is inevitable. He urges the UK to prepare actively for
the entry of the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe in
the Union.
In his book, Sir Leon proposes the introduction of a three-tier voting
system which would balance the need for accelerated decision-making without
upsetting the balance between the big and smaller member states.
The first tier would cover internal market measures, health and safety at
work, farm and fisheries policies, as well as the purchase and sale of goods
and services anywhere in the EU. These measures would be subject to 'low
majority' voting, making it harder for countries to muster a blocking
minority.
A second tier would cover social rules and the environment, as well as
'exceptional trade measures' such as action against low-cost imports. This
would make a majority in favour of action harder to achieve, though still
not impossible for a single country to block.
A third tier would cover the levying of taxes, all moves to European
economic and monetary union, increasing the EU's budget, and all laws on
visas and immigration. On these matters of 'core sovereignty', governments
would retain their right to veto.
Sir Leon's book is part of his undeclared campaign to succeed Mr Delors. It
is already on sale at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, although it was
not due to appear until the end of the month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opponents or critics of the European Union made gains in three elections to
provincial parliaments in Austria yesterday, according to results in
Carinthia, Salzburg and Tyrol.
The far-right Freedom party (FPO), led by Mr Jorg Haider, who waged a
strongly nationalist campaign, and the Greens, who oppose EU membership,
increased their share of the vote.
The two government coalition parties which strongly favour EU membership
lost support, with the conservative People's party (OVP) losing votes in
Salzburg and Tyrol, and the Social Democratic party (SPO) vote declining in
all three provinces.
The FPO vote in Carinthia rose from its record 29 per cent in 1989 to 33.3
per cent. But this will not be enough for Mr Haider to recapture the
province's governorship which he had to give up three years ago after making
remarks praising Nazi Germany's employment policies.
Since then the province has had a conservative governor backed by the OVP
and the SPO. The Social Democrats, however, saw their vote in the province
fall from 46 per cent in 1989 to 37.4 per cent. The maverick Mr Haider has
been ambivalent about the EU.
The Greens did particularly well in Tyrol, winning 10.6 per cent of the vote
and representation in the provincial assembly.
They campaigned strongly against the government's deal with the EU on
transit lorries.
The pro-EU Liberal Forum, scored less than 4 per cent of the vote. Austria
must hold a referendum on EU membership in June.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Rome agrees retirement deal for workers in Ilva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has agreed to fund an early retirement programme for
10,450 people working in Ilva, the state-controlled steel group ordered by
the EU to cut production.
According to trades union representatives the deal, finalised on Saturday,
will cost up to L1,800bn (Pounds 720m) over the next three years.
This is the second time in a fortnight that the government has brokered
costly early retirement packages to solve problems of industrial
restructuring. The previous agreement concerned 6,600 workers in Fiat's
automotive sector. Both have been pushed through in advance of the March 27
general elections.
'It is a costly but effective arrangement,' said Mr Luigi Portioli, a union
official. 'The cost to the public purse will be four times that of Fiat, and
at least L1,800bn will be needed over the next three years to cover all the
early retirements envisaged.'
Ilva, controlled by Iri, the state holding company, undertook last December,
as part of a EU-wide plan to slim steel capacity, to cut production by 1.2m
tonnes a year. The cuts affected 12,517 of its total workforce of 45,000,
the bulk coming from the Taranto steelworks, Europe's largest steel complex.
Under the weekend agreement, early retirement covers most job losses at
Taranto as well as at Ilva's Bagnoli plant, closed 18 months ago.
The deal limits job losses through solidarity contracts - work-sharing
arrangements on reduced pay and hours. Some 1,200 jobs are being saved
through 4,300 solidarity contracts. A further 1,500 will be transferred to
other companies within the group and 1,000 workers will be employed in
community work projects.
With the job aspect of Ilva's restructuring settled, the group's
privatisation will be accelerated. It is being split into two - flat
products and special steels - while a third company will preside over Ilva's
liquidation.
Last week the second phase of bidding for the two new steel companies
closed. Two groups are said to be interested in the flat products division
based around Taranto: a consortium of local Taranto interests, Falck the
Italian steel producer, and foreign investors; and a group led by Italy's
Lucchini steel group, reported to be backed by France's Usinor Sacilor.

FT  14 MAR 94 / EU procurement row with US set to flare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is heading for a showdown with the US over public
procurement after the disclosure that the US has, in the view of Commission
officials, revived efforts to woo Germany away from its European partners.
Last week the Clinton administration quietly dropped trade sanctions against
Germany, apparently implementing the secret non-aggression pact which it
struck with the Bonn government on telecommunications a year ago. Commission
officials said yesterday that the US action appeared aimed at driving a
wedge between Germany and the rest of the European Union.
The US move could trigger Commission measures against Germany if the Bonn
government was shown to have failed to implement EU trade sanctions against
the US. These were imposed last year as part of the long-running
transatlantic dispute over public procurement.
The US action was disclosed in the daily Federal Register of US government
business last Thursday, and comes ahead of a renewed effort by the
Commission and the Clinton administration to resolve outstanding differences
on opening public procurement markets.
The two sides have set a deadline of April 15, when leaders are due to
assemble in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round agreement of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Arguments over fair access to lucrative contracts in road, rail and other
public sector projects flared in the early days of the Clinton
administration. But the row was defused with reciprocal market-opening
measures, supported by token trade sanctions and the promise of an
independent study into trade barriers. Later, however, Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, reached a separate bilateral understanding with Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister. Under the oral deal, Mr Rexrodt
indicated that Germany would not apply Article 29 of the EU's utilities
directive which gives a 3 per cent price preference to EU companies, and
allows a bidder to ignore an offer if it has less than 50 per cent local
content.
The German offer challenged the EU decision to impose a Dollars 15m (Pounds
10.2m) sanctions package against the US. It also appeared to contravene the
Treaty of Rome, which awards sole competence to the European Commission on
trade policy.
A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, said the
Commission had not initiated infringement proceedings against Germany. If
Bonn was not applying the relevant public procurement legislation that would
be 'surprising and disappointing', he said.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Clinton wants talks with Scharping
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration is trying to arrange an early meeting in Washington
between President Bill Clinton and Mr Rudolf Scharping, the German Social
Democratic party leader.
The US approach is being undertaken with the full approval of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, according to officials in Washington. He is said to accept that
it is perfectly normal for the US president to meet leaders of the
opposition in countries close to the US.
The heavy German election season, beginning yesterday in Lower Saxony and
culminating at the national level in October, presents the US with a tricky
problem of diplomatic niceties.
Mr Clinton and Mr Kohl get on well, as witnessed in their genial last
session in Washington in January. In July the president will go to Germany
after the summit in Naples of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Beyond personal rapport, US-German co-operation over issues such as Bosnia
and Russia has become extremely close, partly because of the effectiveness
of Mr Richard Holbrooke, the US ambassador in Bonn. In general terms, the
Clinton administration is giving as high a priority to Germany in the
European context as did its predecessor.
On the other hand, the US can read German public opinion polls as well as
the next country and is aware that Mr Scharping, whom Mr Clinton has never
met, could be the next chancellor.
Mr Scharping also appears a politician in the Clinton image. US officials
are particularly struck by his tough fiscal and budgetary policy proposals,
which they see as similar to the deficit reduction plan now in effect in the
US.
The SDP leader has had some recent contact with US officials. He met Mr
William Perry, now defence secretary, at a conference in Germany some two
months ago.
Mr Clinton will want to avoid the uncomfortable precedent set, in reverse,
in the 1976 US election, when then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's public
preference for President Gerald Ford created problems for the bilateral
relationship when Mr Jimmy Carter became president.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Inflation 'to fall' in west Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation in western Germany is set to fall below 2 per cent, according to
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president.
'Expectations of stability will now be visibly fulfilled and confirmed
through the continuing decline in the rate of price increases,' he told
Dusseldorf foreign exchange dealers at the weekend.
His confident statement, which follows anti-inflationary pay settlements
last week in the engineering and public service sectors, will give support
to the strengthening view among economists that the bank's 5.25 per cent
discount lending rate could fall to 4 per cent or less by the year's end.
'With a February rate of 3.4 per cent we have still not reached where we
ought to be: below 2 per cent. But we are on the way,' Mr Tietmeyer said.
Economists expect the 2 per cent barrier to be breached early next year.
German inflation has fallen below 2 per cent in only two periods in the past
35 years, in the late 1960s, and again between 1986 and 1988.
Mr Tietmeyer shrugged off recent surges in world capital market interest
rates. The development stemmed from the US and Japan. 'It was neither a
typically German nor European phenomenon, and certainly not a result of
developments in our M3,' he said.
M3, the bank's favoured measure of money supply growth and potential
inflation, ballooned in January with an annualised expansion rate of over 20
per cent. International markets, already rattled by fears of rising US
inflation, took fright when the figure was released earlier this month.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Portugal seeks compromise on power-sharing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, has held out the
possibility of a compromise this week to settle the power-sharing row which
could prevent Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway joining the European
Union.
In an interview during a visit to London, Mr Cavaco Silva also urged Britain
to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system it
left in September 1992.
He said he told Mr John Major, the British prime minister, in talks on
Friday that the UK should rejoin the ERM 'to persuade others to move in the
right direction' in progress towards economic and monetary union.
On the EU votes dispute, which pits Britain against most of its EU partners,
Mr Cavaco Silva said he hoped Brussels talks starting tomorrow would agree a
formula under which a minority of states could veto EU decisions in a
16-nation EU.
Most EU members want to raise the so-called 'blocking minority,' the
threshold for blocking decisions in the EU council of ministers, to 27 votes
from 23 at present. Britain and Spain, with some support from Italy, are
insisting on keeping the 23-vote blocking minority unchanged to avoid being
more easily outvoted in the enlarged EU.
Unless resolved, the row could scupper plans for the four members of the
European Free Trade Association (Efta) to join the EU next year.
Mr Cavaco Silva said a deal could set a combination of votes and numbers of
states able to block EU decisions. Since the UK government was 'keen' on
enlarging the EU, he did not think the UK would want the voting disagreement
to hold up accession by the four Efta states.
Mr Cavaco Silva said he agreed on Friday with Mr Major that enlargement
towards the Efta states should be agreed without opening a debate on
fundamental reform of EU decision making, which looks like topping the
agenda of the conference planned for 1996 to review progress of the
Maastricht treaty. 'It would be a mistake to open the institutional question
now,' he said. 'This would not stabilise confidence.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Kohl's party loses support in state election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) coasted to a clear
victory in the state election in Lower Saxony last night, with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union slipping to its worst result in the
state since 1959.
As the first of 19 separate elections this year - 16 state and local
authority elections, an electoral assembly for federal president in May,
European elections in June, and finally the general election on October 16 -
the Lower Saxony vote is seen as a key indicator. It confirms the long
uphill struggle Mr Kohl faces if he is to win re-election, even if the SPD
has yet to gain a decisive lead at a national level.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD premier, won 44.3 per cent of the vote. That
translates into a one-seat majority in the Hanover-based state parliament.
Mr Schroder said he would rule without his former coalition partner, the
Green party.
'It is a great result saddled with a great responsibility,' he said. Without
the Greens 'we can create (policies) more quickly and effectively'.
The CDU fell by almost 6 points from their 1990 showing, scoring 36.4 per
cent. However, the biggest loser of the evening was the Free Democratic
party, Chancellor Kohl's partner in the Bonn coalition, which slumped from 6
per cent last time to 4.4 per cent, failing to make the 5 per cent threshold
needed to ensure seats in the state parliament.
Mr Jurgen Trittin, the leading Green party minister in the outgoing
SPD-Green coalition in Hanover, said: 'This is the day the 'twilight of the
chancellor' began in Bonn.'
Yet the result amounts to less of a setback for Mr Kohl than had been feared
by some party members, and less of a victory for the Social Democrats, who
improved only fractionally on their vote from 1990 in spite of the Bonn
government's obvious unpopularity.
The CDU did far worse in both the previous local elections - in Hamburg last
September, when its vote fell to 25 per cent, and in Brandenburg in
December, when it barely won 20 per cent and fell to third place behind the
Democratic Socialist Party (PDS), the former Communists.
Despite strong winds and heavy rain until two hours before polls closed,
73.8 per cent of voters turned out, slightly less than in 1990, but good
news for the two main parties who feared they would be the first victims of
voter apathy.
The result showed that the rise of protest parties has not happened to the
extent predicted by some political observers.
The Green party won 7.4 per cent of the vote, up from 5.5 per cent in 1990;
the right-wing Republicans secured 3.7 per cent, up from 1.5 per cent; while
the Statt Partei, which won more than 6 per cent in Hamburg last year, took
1.3 per cent.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Electricity pool price falls in chase for market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices in the electricity pool, the wholesale market for power in England
and Wales, have hit record lows as National Power and PowerGen, the two
largest generators, engage in a fierce battle for market share.
The price falls are an unexpected bonus for several thousand industrial
users of electricity. These include Imperial Chemical Industries, whose
power bills are related directly to pool prices and which has long
complained about increases.
Domestic consumers, whose power supplies are protected by long-term hedging
contracts, will not benefit unless prices stay at such low levels for some
months, which is unlikely.
In the pool system generators offer the National Grid a series of prices for
electricity from each of their power stations. The National Grid then
chooses which plants will supply electricity the next day. Electricity from
the pool is bought by large energy users, and regional electricity companies
which distribute it to the public.
The biggest loser from the price fall is Nuclear Electric which earns more
of its income through selling to the pool than the two largest generators,
and is less protected by hedging against unexpected price fluctuations.
Ironically, the record low prices come at the end of a financial year in
which Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, threatened to refer
National Power and PowerGen to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after
earlier price rises.
Last month he decided against a referral after the generators agreed to keep
the pool price below 2.4p/Kwh on average over the next two years.
This suggests that the main component of prices, the so-called system
marginal price, should be 2.1p at most. The SMP is the bid price of
electricity from the most expensive power station needed to meet all
demands.
Last weekend, March 5 and 6, SMP was 1.1p, the lowest daily average since
the pool was set up in March 1990. The average for all days this month
including yesterday was 1.5p, compared with a peak of 2.6p last May and 2.1p
in February. If the March trend were to continue the SMP would be the lowest
for any month since December 1990 when the first power companies were
privatised. The previous lowest was 1.8p in August 1991.
Market analysts were hesitant to draw conclusions on long-term pool prices.
Most believe prices will rise at the start of the new financial year next
month.
They point out that prices often change at this time of year as companies
seek to ensure that profits and market shares are in line with their
expectations, although this year's fall is exceptional. Both National Power
and PowerGen have seen their market shares cut as Nuclear Electric's plants
have improved their performance and new generating companies have come on
stream. Both companies also have policies of reducing coal stocks, which
analysts believe has contributed to the price fall.

FT  14 MAR 94 / PM urged to shelve radical plans: Privatisation of Post
Office and other proposed legislation may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful group of cabinet ministers is pressing Mr John Major to shelve
plans for further radical legislation and concentrate instead on rebuilding
a reputation for competent government in the run-up to the next general
election.
The move looks set to delay indefinitely privatisation of the Post Office.
Many other other controversial reforms covering deregulation, privatisation
and local government reorganisation may also be deferred or dropped.
Mr Major is being told by the so-called consolidators in his cabinet to
eschew Thatcherite radicalism in favour of entrenching past shake-ups of
education, health and other public services.
The ministers believe that with the government already committed to
difficult legislation next year on social security benefits, pensions and
Europe, it cannot afford to take unnecessary risks.
The view runs counter to the instincts of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
who wants the government to maintain the momentum of change. Mr Clarke is
backed by the handful of rightwing ministers in the cabinet.
The division promises a protracted struggle over the next few months as the
cabinet frames the legislative programme for the autumn parliamentary
session.
But after a series of unexpected political rows, defeats in the House of
Lords and embarrassing u-turns during the past few months there is a strong
mood in favour of retrenchment on the Tory back benches.
The consolidators' group, which includes Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, Lord Wakeham, the leader of the House of Lords, and Mr Richard
Ryder, the chief whip, see as their first target the proposed break-up of
the Post Office.
Several have warned that privatisation of the Royal Mail would invite strong
opposition both in the Lords and among Tory MPs because of the potentially
damaging implications for rural services and post offices.
They are supported by several other ministers including Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the House of Commons, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and Mr
William Waldegrave, public services minister.
The consolidators are also resisting Treasury calls for an 'omnibus'
privatisation bill. The Treasury wants to streamline the privatisation
procedure by removing the need for separate 'paving' legislation before each
sale of public assets. But opponents say it would run into certain trouble
in the Lords.
There is also growing pressure from the consolidators for the government to
delay implementation of the recommendations of its Local Government
Commission which is redrawing the boundaries of English local authorities.
The Commission is due to complete its work at the end of this year, but some
ministers want implementation to be put back until after the next general
election.
Other measures facing possible delay are the proposed new privacy
legislation, London taxi and bus deregulation, liberalisation of the
licensing laws and alignment of British Summer Time with continental Europe.
Treasury hopes that the nuclear industry might be privatised in the present
parliament are also being dismissed as unrealistic.
The government is committed by last year's Budget to several controversial
measures. These include bills to curb unemployment and invalidity benefit
and to raise the pension age for women to 65. It will also have to introduce
another European bill to allow for enlargement of the Union and a health
service bill to pave the way for the abolition of regional authorities.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Ministers may use army for airport security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are this week expected to consider using army patrols to boost
security at British airports after a third IRA mortar attack at Heathrow in
five days and further threats to London's two big airports.
Heathrow and Gatwick airports were both closed for several hours last night
after coded warnings, and many flights were diverted. Scotland Yard later
described the warnings as a 'cynical ploy by the IRA to cause unnecessary
confusion and fear amongst the public'.
The scare came as the IRA demanded new direct talks between republicans and
the government. In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA said there had to
be talks if there was any chance of an end to violence. It was prepared to
be flexible and positive in exploring potential for moving the peace process
forward, but lines of communication would have to reopen.
The IRA has yet to make a definitive response to the Downing Street
declaration reached between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, three months ago, but this is as close as it has come to
acknowledging that the agreement is not enough to stop its campaign.
Meanwhile, army personnel and equipment helped search Heathrow for further
devices following yesterday's attack in which four mortars, fired from a
heavily camouflaged launcher, failed to explode.
One hit the roof of Terminal 4, which was closed for eight hours, causing
delays to flights. The police believe the launchers involved in the three
attacks were placed at the same time. The launchers involved in the two
lastest attacks had timers attached to them.
The IRA's ability to embarrass the security forces and disrupt travel will
today bring renewed calls at Westminster for tighter security.
The government, however, will be anxious to prevent the IRA using the
introduction of army patrols as a propaganda coup. It is also aware that
tighter security measures in one location may only switch IRA attacks
elsewhere.
Ministers could meet as early as today to decide whether to approve a
high-profile army presence at airports. Downing Street said any requests
from the police for the army's help would be carefully considered.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, last night accused Sinn Fein and the
IRA of showing 'utter contempt' for the peace process. He believed the
mortar attacks had turned Sinn Fein's internal discussions on the peace
process into a 'bizarre charade' and said people viewed with growing dismay
the prospects for an early end to violence.
Last night the IRA claimed its warnings were deliberately ignored. 'The luck
of the British authorities who are deliberately taking these calculated and
cynical gambles with peoples' lives will inevitably run out,' it said.
London hotels fear the attacks will lead to cancellations by businessmen and
tourists this summer - particularly US visitors. But US business people
leaving New York for London yesterday thought it would have little immediate
effect.
The IRA action is also likely to bring Dublin under more pressure from
British ministers to improve cross-border co-operation in combating
terrorism - an issue already high on the Anglo-Irish agenda.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain will pay the Dollars 29.5m (Pounds 20.2m) damages to settle a
dispute over fees charged to US airlines landing at London's Heathrow
airport, the Department of Transportation in Washington announced last
night.
The department said the agreement settled a long dispute over fees at the
airport between 1983 and 1989. It said Britain had agreed to change the
charging system at Heathrow to make it fairer to US carriers.
The settlement was reached after an international arbitration panel ruled
that Britain had failed to use its best efforts to ensure that charges at
Heathrow were just and reasonable. It concludes years of negotiations and
litigation.
Britain also agreed to drop claims it had filed against the US over charges
at US airports. The US agreed to encourage its airports to consult with
airline users in setting their fees.

The fashion collection which has inspired such a sanctimonious brouhaha in
the British press (and earned nothing but praise elsewhere) was dedicated by
Vivienne Westwood to John Stuart Mill's essay, On Liberty.
Since this is the great liberal-utilitarian argument for free speech,
Westwood cannot object to all that wordy outrage; she is just, as ever, a
little disappointed at being so wilfully misunderstood.
At the nub of the dispute is the question: what are Paris catwalk shows for?
Certain mature British fashion journalists believe they are to show nice
outfits that they personally can buy and wear next season. Some designers
agree. Other designers, however, think of the runway show both as spectacle
and as a forum for ideas.
Ideas? Isn't that, you might well mutter, a little pretentious? We're
talking frocks here. But the truth about Vivienne Westwood and the
homosexual male designers indicted for misogyny last week is that their
medium is not only bits of cloth; it is woman's identity, particularly her
sexual identity. And it is inevitable that, just as in an art gallery or a
theatre, the more exploratory and experimental the designer's ideas, the
more they will shock us, amuse us, make us think a little.
The fashion designer's vocabulary is composed of the many images of
femaleness which women have worn through the centuries of human
civilisation. As with a living language, new words must be coined to
describe new concepts but their roots will be in words which already exist.
Twenty-five years after the start of the second phase of women's
mobilisation for equality, we are still seeking new definitions of
femininity. Arguably, this is an endless search.
Any new definition must come partly out of the old. Predominant are those
essentially male fantasies which we now categorise as pornographic but in
whose creation (and Westwood for one is quite clear on this) women colluded.
They are female identities modern woman needs to confront and explore.
On the runways of Paris and of London, Milan and New York designers, male
and female, homo- and heterosexual, use the vocabulary at their disposal to
do that. Westwood just does it more self-consciously and with more humour,
playing with archetypes and goading us to deconstruct them. Breasts have had
a lot of her attention. She has explored their erotic potential from maximum
artificiality to complete naturalness. And so, on her heels, have the other
designers. Indeed, nowadays a nipple or a thousand nipples pass unnoticed on
the catwalks.
Nevertheless, on the morning after her show, Westwood was once again called
upon to deny that she really expected women to bare their nipples on the
Tube or to employ a bustle to quell the competition for the last seat.
Aware of the history, and aware that, while the bustle was being lampooned
in the press, Mill's essay was being debated in the drawing rooms of Europe
and the Americas, Westwood set out to make connections and to amuse.
Mill, of course, also wrote On the Subjection of Women, the tract which
inspired the suffragettes. He was more concerned with lack of property
rights and domestic slavery than with corsets, but fashion historians and
feminist theorists have taken the corset and the crinoline as symbols for
woman, the non-citizen, the non-person.
It was Westwood who deconstructed that concept, perhaps not totally
satisfactorily but, at least, illuminatingly. Mill may be her hero but
Westwood says she's no feminist. That does not deter feminist semioticians
from admiring her. They, she may be mortified to know, do understand her.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Private View: More Big Bang for our bucks - Christian Tyler
meets the man responsible for Europe's planned proton-smasher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is it worth to you if they discover the Higgs boson? It is not an idle
question, for this summer ministers and their advisers from 19 European
countries are likely to tell the scientists of Cern, the particle physics
laboratory outside Geneva, that they can have Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) of
taxpayers' money to build a big proton-smasher inside their 27km circular
tunnel.
Few of us taxpayers will get a chance to say what we think about this latest
stage in the hunt for particles that might illuminate the dawn of time. So,
calculating my own contribution at about Pounds 1 a year - say a fiver for
the family - I flew to Geneva to ask the head boson-hunter what the payback
was.
Professor Christopher Llewellyn Smith is a 51-year-old theoretical physicist
and cross-country Blue from Oxford who became director general of Cern in
January. He has a rapid, precise manner - not without humour - and the
faintly mid-Atlantic speech of the globe-trotting academic. He did not try
to blind me with science, choke me with muons, gluons and quarks of colour,
charm and spin, nor dazzle me with the infinitely large and infinitesimally
small quantities his profession trades in.
So, endeavouring to look my most alert, I asked: What will the Higgs boson
do for the taxpayer?
'It is one very, very major step in understanding the way the universe is
put together,' he replied. 'If you ask why anyone should be interested, I
think there are three parts to the answer.
'First, the subject is justified as the pursuit of pure knowledge. I mean,
it's part of our culture.' He quoted a remark of the first director of
Fermilab who, asked by a US congressional committee what the lab contributed
to the defence of the nation, replied: 'Nothing. But it makes it worth
defending.'
'It's part of mankind's history to be curious about how things work,' the
professor added. 'We're trying to find out at the deepest level what matter
is made of, why the universe is the way it is and not some other way.'
His second argument was, not surprisingly, about direct and indirect
spin-off. But he did not labour it. The discovery of new fundamental laws of
physics usually had important practical applications, such as the discovery
of the electron. However, that was getting harder to be sure of, the further
physics moved away from everyday experience. 'So I don't think you can
justify the expenditure on those grounds.'
Technical development was another kind of spin-off. For example, the
collision detectors pioneered by Georges Charpak of Cern (and for which he
won a Nobel prize in 1992) were used for medical imaging; accelerators were
employed for cancer therapy.
'That's not the reason you do it, but it gives some return and you should
subtract it from the price. I always say it's a bit like subsidising the
theatre in London: it brings in tourists, but that's not the reason you
subsidise theatre.'
His third justification was education. Flagship projects attracted
schoolchildren to science, even if they ended up in engineering rather than
cosmology, while graduate students acquired valuable, if expensive, training
at Cern.
But, I said, the search for knowledge is the real reason?
'It is the real reason, I absolutely agree with that.'
For some people the scale of the endeavour alone may be sufficient
justification for spending the money. The Large Hadron Collider will be
inserted into the biggest of Cern's tunnels, a racetrack several miles
longer than the Circle Line of the London Underground. Where it takes a man
six hours to walk round, the protons will whip round the circuit 11,000
times a second. Their path is so precisely aligned that even the daily
gravitational pull of the moon has to be adjusted for. To get them to fly in
a circular path requires six tonnes of magnetic force every metre. The
debris of the collisions - including perhaps the Higgs boson - will be
detected by machines three storeys high, in a microcosm of what was going on
a fraction of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang which began the
universe.
The Higgs particle was postulated years ago by Prof Peter Higgs of Edinburgh
University to explain why some particles are massive, some massless.
Llewellyn Smith said it would help us understand why some forces of nature
operate over vast distances, others over minute distances, and why matter is
clumped as it is. 'This research can tell us why the universe is arranged
with islands of stars called galaxies, why it has this architecture. I think
these are pretty interesting questions.'
And if you do not find it?
'There must be some mechanism. If it's not the Higgs, we don't know what it
is. But we're going to discover something else instead which we haven't been
clever enough to imagine.'
But what about the cost? I asked. Can you not see a point at which
politicians will stop being interested?
'I would say that convincing politicans is not so hard. To a certain extent
the hardest people to persuade are people in other fields of science because
they are - well, jealous is the right word, I guess.
'It's difficult for people doing biology who need only a few thousand
pounds, a tiny fraction of what is going into Cern. So you get the argument:
why not do biology? It's cheaper than physics. But by the same argument, why
not do theology? It's cheaper than biology. There's a rather nice quote from
a French boulevardiste, one of whose characters asks why he should pay 15
francs for an umbrella when he can have a beer for two sous.'
I thought of the US decision to cancel its Dollars 10bn Superconducting
Super Collider in Texas which would have been three times the length of
Cern's. Scientific advances were quite cheap in the past, I said. Can we
justify our thirst for knowledge indefinitely?
'Well, that's our job in particle physics. We have kept the cost down. The
budget of Cern in real terms is less than it was 20 years ago, despite the
fact that the number of physicists who work here is five times bigger.'
The SFr2.23bn material cost of the Large Hadron Collider will not involve
more than about SFr500m of new money: the bulk will come out of Cern's
existing budget, currently SFr900m a year, as its other experiments wind
down. The two new detectors, costing SFr350m each, may be financed out of
university research budgets.
'People sometimes say it's like the opera and should be subsidised at the
same level. I think it's more than that, because scientific knowledge is
cumulative, it's more like the composition of an opera than the performance,
if you like. The discoveries made in the 19th century are still driving
today's electrical industry, for example. And those in the 30s are driving
semiconductors.'
You may be able to appeal to politicians or to national or European pride, I
said. But won't taxpayers protest if they can't understand what you're up
to?
'That's why I think we have a big obligation to explain what we're doing -
for a grand reason and a pragmatic reason. The grand reason is that we'd
like other people to share in the pleasure we get in the things we're doing:
and if it is a contribution to culture then presumably we can all share it.
'The pragmatic reason, obviously, is if we can't explain then obviously
we're going to lose the support.'
Of course, I said, I'm impressed you can look at the state of the universe
some fraction of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. But I'd pay a
lot more to know what happened a fraction before.
'In a sense the Big Bang is infinitely far away in terms of its energy
density. In time it's a finite way away. But we never will really get there.
The energy at which one could directly test the theories that put all the
forces together is still a factor of about a million, billion away in terms
of energy.
'It's an interesting question what is in science and what isn't. I think to
paraphrase St Augustine, the most profound question that human beings can
ask is: 'why is there something rather than nothing?'
'Now, that question, it seems to me, is beyond the scope of science and
probably will always be - though there are scientists who think not. On the
other hand, the question we're asking in particle physics is: given that
there is something rather than nothing, why is it what it is, rather than
something else? And that question I think we may be able to answer.'
Would it be better for you if the results are a shock - better than getting
the predicted answer?
'Yes. It's paradoxes that show there's a real question there.'
So when you find the Higgs boson, it's going to be both a triumph and an
anti-climax?
'In a sense to find something different would be more interesting, yes.
That's true.'
If they find the boson, do you get a Nobel prize? The professor laughed.
'Certainly not. Probably Mr Higgs gets a Nobel prize.'
Well, for my fiver, I hope he does.

FT  12 MAR 94 / What kind of ghoul am I?: Dominic Lawson casts a sceptical
eye on the press and Cromwell Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late last year I was driving at speed down the M4, when the traffic in front
of me began to slow rapidly. So rapidly, that I almost collided with the car
I was following. There were no roadworks. The traffic was not heavy. There
had been no collision or crash. We were near the Windsor junction, and to
the left a building was ablaze.
The drivers who had slowed to 25 miles an hour, and were winding down their
windows to get a better look, could not all have guessed that it was one of
the Queen's residences which was on fire. But someone's palatial home was
being cruelly destroyed and someone's priceless possessions were being
reduced to ashes.
I doubt that at that moment any of the fire-gazers, myself included, felt
much sympathy for the unknown householder. We were just overwhelmed by
curiosity. We were ghouls. Newspapers love the word 'ghoul', chiefly,
perhaps, because its monosyllabic terseness fits into a tabloid headline.
The word has been used repeatedly this week in the reports of the scenes
outside 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, as, over a period of days, the
remains of nine female bodies have been disinterred and brought out in
boxes.
You would think, from the comments of journalists, that the behaviour of
local sightseers was worse than that of whoever put the bodies there.
Frederick West, a former resident of 25 Cromwell Street, has been charged
with murder.
Paul Callan, the Daily Express's man outside 25 Cromwell Street, and that
newspaper's most talented 'colour' writer, was particularly outraged.
Under the headline 'Place where people just don't care', Callan stigmatised
'the ghoul watch' as a daily, sickening sight. He added to his list of
'sickos' the man who now owns the scaffolding-covered No 25 for 'charging
Pounds 450 for television crews to clamber up, and Pounds 60 for Fleet
Street photographers.'
Well, this is indeed all very shocking.
I imagine we should take it as read that the Daily Express's photographer
was far too noble and sensitive a spirit to pay his Pounds 60 and provide a
picture of what his own newspaper tastefully calls 'The House of Death'.
And I imagine that the editor of the Daily Express was most calm and
understanding when his star photographer explained why it would be unethical
and, let us use the word, ghoulish, to pay Pounds 60 to the owner of number
25.
I also wonder what the newspapers would call the owner if he had not charged
them for their pictures: 'helpful' perhaps. Certainly not 'sick'.
The point, naturally, is that the owners of local properties can make big
money from facilitating 'ghoulish' pictures only if Fleet Street wants to
publish them.
The main distinguishing characteristic of the members of the Cromwell Street
'ghoul watch', is that, unlike most of the tabloid readership, they live
close enough to the scene of the crimes to see it for themselves.
They do not need to cough up 32p for a copy of the Daily Express to see the
photograph which accompanied Callan's article: a shocked looking police
officer emerging from the house carrying a box with a black cloth covering
the unmentionable things which it must have contained.
And about 3in away from Callan's excoriating prose, his employer, under a
bold headline, begs: 'Do you or did you know Fred West, or have any pictures
of him? The Daily Express would like to hear from you - call us on
071-922-7210.' This, presumably is the Daily Express's very own 'ghoul
line'.
Among the Cromwell Street residents whose cynicism has shocked Paul Callan,
is a lady who charges onlookers Pounds 2 for a box of sandwiches. He quotes
her as saying: 'Just providing a service dear.' So are we all, Paul dear, so
are we all. We just have different ways of describing the same activity.
All, together, conjugate after me: I am a newspaper reporter; you are a
Daily Express reader; they are all ghouls.
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Hawks  Handsaws: Save the male
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have won nothing but abuse for my suggestion last week that men today are
getting an amazingly rotten deal in comparison with women, at least in
developed countries; that it is men, not women, who need increased
protection from life's brutalities; and that traditional roles - man the
protector, woman the protected - have become unworkable.
I did not invent these ideas. They have been advanced by Dr Warren Farrell,
a US academic, whose courageous book, The Myth of Male Power, has got me
into such hot water with my executive assistant.
Miss Lee was in fine form this week, feline and pouty. A Thatcherite, she
recently binned all her Jaeger gear and is now stomping about in topline
Versace. The bit from last week's column that caused her the greatest
merriment was Dr Farrell's suggestion - reasonable, civilised  - that we
should care as much about males as we care about whales.
Miss Lee finds this sentiment inexpressibly comedic, and has reacted by
joining Greenpeace (unusual for a Thatcherite, to say the very least) and by
commissioning, from an artist she supports, a painting of killer whales
surfacing off Antarctica.
She breezed in upon me yesterday. Was just off to lunch. Teetering and
tottering. She said: 'The whales are doing fine, Michael; how about you
males?'
I said: 'Oh, supremely funny. It is a pity, Miss Lee, that women can only
chortle at male pain and suffering, because the problem is growing
globally.'
'Fiddlesticks.'
'So tell me this: why do women live longer than men? It is a question
Farrell asks; the answer is upsetting. Quoting from US experience and
statistics, he says that in 1920 women lived one year longer than men. Today
women live seven years longer. Life expectancy for white females is 79; for
black females, 74; for white males, 72; and for black males, 65. 'Power', he
says, 'is the ability to control one's life. Death tends to reduce control.
Life expectancy is the bottom line - the ratio of our life's stresses to our
life's rewards'.
'It gets worse. Blacks die earlier than whites from 12 of the 15 leading
causes of death. But men die earlier than women from all 15 causes. They
include heart disease, accidents, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes
mellitus, suicide, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, kidney inflammation,
Aids, murder.
'In industrialised societies, says Farrell, early deaths are caused more by
diseases triggered by stress, which breaks down the immune system, than in
non-industrialised ones. It is principally stress that is killing men so
much sooner than women.
'Compared with other diseases, heart attack has now become the No 1 killer
of women. But men are still far more vulnerable to death from this cause
than women. Before the age of 65, men still die from heart attack at the
rate of almost 3:1 compared with women. Almost three-quarters of women who
die of heart attack are 75 or older. But by then the average (white) male
has been dead three years.
'Men lose out all round. In the US, 83 per cent of the homeless are male, as
are 90 per cent of deaths from Aids and 94 per cent of the prison
population; 99.99 per cent of the 58,183 names on the Vietnam veterans'
memorial in Washington, DC, are names of men.
'There is a huge amount of data in The Myth of Male Power, plus a great deal
of plucky interpretation. Farrell shatters every assumption about
masculinity you have ever heard. What he has to say is searingly non-PC  -
raw and challenging. Farrell says he does not want to dismantle feminism; he
just wants us to recognise that, in different ways, men too have been
oppressed and damaged by gender role-playing.
'Miss Lee, imagine the uproar if tonight's TV bulletins reported that women
were dying seven years earlier than men, and that women had been identified
as the principal victims of every single one of the 15 leading causes of
death.'
Miss Lee looked amused. Shook her expensive hair. Straightened the platinum
Dalmatian brooch stuck in the lapel of her Versace.
She said: 'Try and get some air, Michael. Walk across the bridge. Get
yourself a sandwich. You look pasty-faced and stressed, and that jacket
needs cleaning. I would hate something to happen to you. Try a new haircut.
You have got to get a life.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. Arnie writes:
Early March was grim - heavy rain, ice and thick fog. In North Carolina we
slithered to a halt on a steep road to Hawksnest, unable to continue (it
turned out to be closed anyway). And we missed Sugar Mountain completely in
the fog, ending up at Beech Mountain where visibility was so appalling that
for self-preservation we skied only three runs.
When the fog lifted we found Sugar Mountain, the biggest skiing area in the
valley, and made a determined effort to make up for lost time by
night-skiing.
Reaching Snowshoe, West Virginia, brought a sigh of relief - a real ski
resort with a 1,200ft vertical drop and one particularly exhilarating run
called Cupp Trail, 1 1/2 miles long. We have enjoyed North America
enormously, but now can't wait to arrive in Europe on Monday.
Readers could win a skiing holiday in Courmayeur, or ski equipment, by
entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on March 5 (copies
from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).

FT  12 MAR 94 / Skiing: Tales of grizzly bears and T-bars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Whitefish, Montana, they still laugh at the events of December, 1947,
when more than a thousand local people from the Flathead Valley made their
way to the slopes of Big Mountain to witness an historic event: the opening
of the first ski-lift.
Ed Schenck and George Prentice, the principal investors in what was
originally known as the Hell Roaring Ski Corporation (named after a nearby
mountain) had spent half the night getting the lift ready.
This is Schenck's account: 'We sat down with the book of instructions and
tried to puzzle out how to adjust the T-bars. The directions said to turn
the retracting spring 11 times. Working by candle and flashlight, we did
this.
'Next morning, the motor coughed, and the first skiers took off. 'Oh no]'
George howled, and turned his reddening face away.
'Instead of riding up the hill with the T-bar supporting them under their
hips, these first riders were dangling 10 feet in the air and spinning round
and round. It was like a Bob Hope movie.
'The retracting spring had evidently been wound up sufficiently at the
factory. But since most of the skiers hadn't seen a T-bar lift before, they
didn't know anything was wrong. So George and I kept straight faces and
finished the day]'
Things have progressed in the ski industry in Montana since then. For those
who find Colorado and even Utah expensive and touristy (as all good places
tend to become) Montana may indeed live up to its reputation as 'The Last
Best Place'. A surprising number of local skiers are refugees from Colorado.
With more than 60 trails served by nine lifts, a vertical drop of 2,300ft
and a longest run of 2.5 miles, plus night-skiing and Snow Cat skiing, The
Big Mountain - Montana's biggest ski area - provides as much good skiing as
most of its better known counterparts. And a lift ticket costs Dollars 32
(Pounds 21) - Dollars 10 cheaper than the norm in Colorado.
The Big Mountain, 19 miles from Glacier Park International Airport in
north-west Montana, is isolated from other ski areas in the north-west. But
in the south west of the state an assortment of resorts enables visiting
skiers with a rental car to try a good cross-section.
If you hanker after steep but manageable terrain, head for Bridger Bowl up
in the Crazy Mountains (named after the sole woman survivor of an Indian
massacre who wandered the area and finally went mad) and the Bangtail
Mountains (named after the wild horses whose tails, knotted with frozen
snow, could be heard in winter banging against their thighs).
Bridger (lift ticket Dollars 24) is a smallish cult resort just to the north
of Yellowstone National Park which attracts skiers in search of off-piste
thrills. There are good nursery slopes (50 trails altogether) but they are
not what the local powder hounds, or 'Ridge Hippies' come for.
The main quest for these hounds is The Ridge, an extreme area with terrain
verying between challenging and suicidal, leading to The Nose, The Apron and
the North and South Bowls, ony reached by a short sharp hike. (There is a
rope tow to the top, but it is exclusively for the use of the Ski Patrol.)
With runs like Must Turn Left, Sometimes A Great Notion and Avalanche Gully
(none of which is shown on the official trail map) to choose from, it is
best to ski The Ridge with someone who knows what they are doing and where
they are going. I was accompanied by Doug Wales, Bridger's marketing
director.
Mercifully, Doug did not take me into the steep and narrow Hidden Gully
entrance into the Apron since I found the Apron itself challenging enough to
make me go wandering in the Crazy Mountains myself.
Yellowstone has another big ski area on its doorstep: Big Sky - reached,
like Bridger, from Bozeman. It too has recently opened up one area just for
advanced skiing - Lone Mountain, at 11,166ft, where the new Challenger lift
serves only single and double black diamond runs.
Contrary to Bridger Bowl, which has to remind skiers that it has ordinary
cruising runs and beginner slopes, Big Sky needed the Challenger lift
because it had a reputation for not enough advanced terrain.
With 65 miles of mainly beginner and intermediate skiing predominantly on
Andesite Mountain, and even some European-style gondolas - a rarity in the
US - Big Sky is still essentially a resort for the average family skier to
cruise all day (lift ticket Dollars 38).
Another resort in the region worth visiting is Red Lodge, rejoicing in
better days now that it has changed its name from Grizzly Peak. Any bear
attack anywhere in the Rockies used to send skiers into a panic, even during
winter when bears - if any - would be hibernating. The mountain itself still
retains the name Grizzly Peak.
Skiers at Red Lodge frequently enjoy a classic temperature inversion that
enables then to ski at almost 10,000ft in relative warmth of temperatures
above freezing, while the nearest big town, Billings might be several
degrees colder.
With a Dollars 24 lift ticket, Red Lodge has 35 trails, a vertical drop of
just over 2,000ft and has plans to build North America's first ski resort
funicular to get skiers on to the slopes from the car park and from the
quaint little town of Red, often used as the setting for western movies.
When Ed Schenck first arrived in Montana he recalls that a 'committee
dressed in coonskin caps and snowshoes took me up to inspect the skiing
country. They were as eager to please as rental agents in a ghost town.
'When we finally struggled to the top, we found breathtaking, vast, open
snowfields where you can ski in any direction, seven-foot deep snow topped
by soft powder, and sunshine - all the things a skier dreams about.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Sport: The jilted brokers of the big match - Is English
football doomed? Peter Berlin scans another blueprint for the game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is sometimes difficult to recall, in the gloom that has enveloped English
football how narrow the margin of World Cup failure was. If in two similar
positions (Des Walker grabs Marc Overmars' shirt outside England's penalty
area, Overmars falls inside penalty area; Ronald Koeman grabs David Platt's
shirt outside the Dutch penalty area, Platt falls inside penalty area) the
refereeing decisions had been reversed (no penalty to the Netherlands;
penalty to England) things would be different.
England would be heading for the World Cup finals; Terry Venables would
still be out of work; Peter Beardsley, Matthew Le Tissier and Darren
Anderton would not have played for England against Denmark on Wednesday and
Out of Time, Why Football Isn't Working] by Alex Fynn and Lynton Guest would
not be high in the sports best seller list. The book struck a nerve with
despondent English fans.
Fynn and Guest were two of the losers in the money-spinning summer of 1992
when the Premier League broke from the Football League and then negotiated a
Pounds 304m television contract with BSkyB.
Guest, a journalist, was involved with FTC, a small television company,
which was briefly involved in the television bidding process. Fynn, an
executive at Saatchi and Saatchi, the advertising agency, provided the
Football Association with the mouthwatering financial projections it used as
bait to attract the top clubs to its breakaway league. But Saatchi and then
Fynn were spurned as contracts and jobs were handed out. The marketing
strategy he had offered the FA was forgotten.
The core of this book is the two chapters on the creation of the Premier
League and the subsequent television negotiations. Fynn was behind, or just
outside, the locked doors as the deals were done and the boots flew. The
writers offer an account which has not appeared elsewhere, settle a few
scores and point out where football went wrong; that is, where it deviated
from Fynn's blueprint.
The two insist they are not just insiders but fans too - Guest supports
Leicester, Fynn Newcastle. The proof lies in the rest of the book, much of
which reads as if it was largely written on a particularly angry night in
the pub; notably the tedious, second-hand fan-rants against former England
manager Graham Taylor which begin and end the book.
Fynn's blueprint is a marketing man's plan for football. The best way to
sell the sport is to organise a league in which matches are scarce and every
one is an event, a contest between glamorous teams with national profiles.
To do this the FA must shrink the top division to exclude clubs with local
profiles. These must maximise their income by playing in regional divisions
which multiply local derbies.
Fynn argues that a successful national team helps sell the game at all
levels. By happy chance his plan for the league is also good for the
national team: reducing the number of club matches cuts wear and tear on
players.
For Fynn, big clubs are good, smaller clubs are bad. Fynn attacks the TV
arrangements in the UK because in the bulk of satellite-free households
children will be deprived of the chance to support the big, glamorous clubs
and must, instead, become fans of the first division clubs they see on ITV.
The book laments the fall of Liverpool (victims of the system) and praises
AC Milan (owned by Silvio Berlusconi, who Fynn has advised).
Fynn tells how the FA surrendered the initiative on the Premier League in a
clandestine meeting at Goodison Park, Everton's ground, between the FA and
representatives of the biggest clubs, at which Fynn seems to have been
present.
He writes: 'Concluding the meeting Philip Carter (chairman of Everton) said:
'Well gentlemen . . . all that remains to do is elect our chief executive.'
. . . Charles Hughes (the FA's director of coaching) broke in . . . 'We
already have a chief executive there.' He pointed at a rather
uncomfortable-looking Graham Kelly (chief executive of the FA). Kelly said
nothing and the opportunity was gone.'
Rather than keep the league under FA control, Kelly let Rick Parry, an
accountant, become chief executive. With the league granted independence it
fell under the political control of Ken Bates, chairman of Chelsea, champion
of the middle-sized club, and the man who had promoted the return to a
22-club first division.
Bates, says Fynn, does not believe football matches should be scarce. He
believes in 'a marginal costing system'. Since a club's costs are largely
fixed, more games mean more profit. A bigger league and more cup
competitions are, therefore, good things. This view is shared by the
middle-sized clubs who form the bulk of the top English division.
Bates' political objective was to ensure these clubs had equal power in the
Premier League. After the league was set up, Bates crowed: 'David Dein
(vice-chairman of Arsenal) was so over the moon at getting his little
Premier League and couldn't understand why Ken Bates was so supportive. We
got a few things in there . . . He is only now begining to realise what hit
him. One club, one vote, no committees . . . so you have no permanent chance
to be in the corridors of power.'
Bates also set the agenda for the television deal that followed. Fynn thinks
this was a marketing disaster: the football weekend spread over three days,
all the tiddlers guaranteed live matches, the big clubs largely restricted
to satellite. The league, says Fynn, could have negotiated a much better
deal. But the decision to opt for BSkyB was not purely financial. Bates and
his mates were prepared to accept a slightly smaller pie, so long as they
kept their hands on the cake slice.
Bates commands an army of 12 to 14 middle-sized clubs each with one vote in
the 22-team Premier League. I asked Fynn how he could overcome Bates. 'I
intend to persuade him that Chelsea are one of the big clubs,' he said.
But Fynn can hardly perform the same trick with Coventry or Wimbledon. To
persuade them to do as Raith Rovers have done in Scotland and vote for a
smaller Premier League knowing that such a change could bring them
relegation, would test the most resourceful marketing man.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Sport: Concertina plays blues for Intrum - Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread sailors call it 'the concertina', but its music has no charms.
When the fleet is stretched out in line, racing to the finish, a breeze that
dies from the leaders backwards will have the effect of bunching the yachts.
In the last two days this nautical torture has been inflicted on Intrum
Justitia as she set the pace towards the end of leg four in Punta del Este,
Uruguay.
On Wednesday night Intrum, skippered by British yachtsman Lawrie Smith, was
91 miles ahead of her closest rivals Tokio and Yamaha and seemed a certain
bet to take the Heineken trophy for the leg. By morning it was a different
story. The breeze was soft and right on the nose, behind them Tokio and
Yamaha had closed the gap to a mere 25 miles with only 445 miles left to the
finish.
'We're treating this stage like an inshore race in the English Channel,
sleeping on the rail instead of going down below,' said Pierre Maas,
Intrum's watchleader over the radio. 'But at least we've proved that we can
be fast in light airs as well as in the strong running conditions.'
Just prior to Cape Horn the yacht set another 24-hour record with a 428-mile
run.
Overall, Tokio holds a 17-hour lead from the rest of the highly competitive
W60 class. Three other yachts, Yamaha, Intrum and Galicia Pescanova, are
good enough to catch her but with the race two-thirds gone, time is running
out.
Yamaha left Southampton six months ago as the favourite. Since then she has
been dogged by misfortune, some of it self-inflicted with repeated changes
in the crucial navigator role. Now, she is making up ground on Intrum, and
could be second into Uruguay.
'The wind is forecast to head us and stay in the north for a day and a half.
It'll come down to who picks the weather best,' said skipper Ross Field.
Aboard Tokio, the young Kiwi Chris Dickson is frustrated. 'We had a
spinnaker on for the first time in seven days,' he told Punta via Inmarsat.
'It's unbelievable that in this downwind race we have been going upwind for
so damn long.
'It's tough on the boat, gear and the people. We were geared for spinnaker
work but we've had 90 per cent headwinds. It's like going skiing and getting
a five-minute run at the beginning of the day, before spending the next 48
hours struggling uphill into a blizzard with your skis on your back.'
Compared with the trauma aboard British entry Dolphin, lying eighth, Tokio
has the problems of a poor little rich kid.
'Since we left Auckland three weeks ago the primary winch has been ripped
from the deck, three keel bolts have sheared, the headfoil which holds the
jib in place has shattered and the mainsail has been shredded into pieces,'
said 23-year-old skipper Matt Humphries. 'The heavy No 1 genoa has been
transformed into a mainsail and brass hanks fitted to a spare jib so that we
can fly a foresail. But we are still about 60 sq m down on sail area and the
girls on Heineken are catching us fast.'
All 14 yachts had a relatively easy passage around Cape Horn, although the
week before they rounded the bleak headland was rough and uncomfortable,
with some of the strongest winds and most complex weather systems the
skippers have had to face.
Marcel van Triest, Intrum's navigator, said: 'During that second week in the
Southern Ocean there were so many low pressure centres, if we had got it
just slightly wrong we could have been down the drain like Winston.' (The US
entry took a gamble and ended up 150 miles behind the leaders in less than
day.)
The past week illustrates perfectly the complexity and richness of the
Whitbread. A week ago the crews were lucky to see so much as an albatross as
they shivered below deck in wet sleeping bags with the temperature only just
above freezing. On deck there was 50 knots of wind and a helmsman wearing a
full face mask and ski goggles.
Yesterday, reported New Zealand Endeavour, the red dust from the Argentinian
pampas was blown 250 miles offshore, dirtying the foredeck, and the crew was
sunbathing in shorts and T-shirts. At the helm it was a minute-by-minute
battle just to keep the 27 tonnes of maxi-ketch moving through the water.
Intrum was in sight just over two miles ahead.
'Light weather isn't perfect but it suits us. For the first time in days
we've been able to put time on every yacht in the fleet,' said skipper Grant
Dalton. His maxi is second on the water to Intrum but against the sluggish
maxi rivals Merit Cup and la Poste, his race is as good as won. The W60s
still have everything to play for.

FT  12 MAR 94 / As They Say In Europe: Sons of Amon Goth queue for tickets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sins of the fathers are being visited on the sons, and grandsons, in no
uncertain terms these days. The latest manifestation is the Schindler's List
phenomenon. The Holocaust is now enshrined in a Hollywood epic, a fact that
has caused some to object, and others much heartache and heartsearching.
Liberation dedicated six pages on one day alone to the film and its
ramifications. The Lisbon weekly Expresso devoted a full 15 pages of its
review section not only to the film but also to a lesson in history for an
audience geographically as remote as one could be in Europe from the events
recounted.
In Austria, a country in which recent history has been overlooked, the
Vienna city government reserved 7,500 cinema seats for schoolchildren free
of charge.
In the German press there are even now some old scores to be settled: there
is scarcely a mention of the sadistic camp commander, Amon Goth, who plays
such a large part in the film, without the ascription, Der Wiener - the
Viennese. There is no end to the research. The Tageszeitung of Berlin found
survivors in Florida who knew Schindler after the war and those who could
testify how unloved the man was in his own community.
In Switzerland, the Neue Zurcher ran a feature on an overlooked hero,
Berthold Beitz of the Krupp concern, who saved many Jews in what is now
Ukraine. The paper was fascinated by two questions: how had Alfred Krupp
been able to become one of the richest men in the world having been
convicted of the exploitation of slave labour? And how could the Nazis have
acted 'without any economic logic' in pursuit of their programme?
It is evident that the present generation in western Europe, at least, finds
the story incomprehensible, except in the sense that it is known to have
happened. There is a suggestion that Schindler's List gains impact from
events in Bosnia but the truth is probably the other way round.
In eastern Europe the position is murkier. The communists concealed the
reality of the Final Solution by turning it into a tale of communist heroism
in the anti-fascist struggle. Today those societies are having to come to
terms with problems that were ignored or rejected. Thus in the Czech
republic there is agonising over the law on the restitution of Jewish
property which presents entirely different problems from those associated
with property confiscated by the communists.
The Russian news agency, Tass, described the film as 'documenting one German
man's effort to help Jews trapped in Hitler's Germany'. Poland is where the
events occurred and the film was made and reaction there has been mixed.
There is pride that Poland and Poles should have played a part in making the
film, and there is anger that it highlights Polish anti-Semitism. One paper,
Slowo, said Nazi officials were portrayed in a sympathetic light compared
with the Poles. Slowo has it in for Schindler himself: he was 'a spy in
Poland before the war'. And he 'saved only those who were rich', a charge
which must be absurd as the victims had already been robbed.
The film critic of Rzeczpospolita wondered why it had been left to Hollywood
to produce the definitive film. 'Had one to be, perhaps, at a distance,
physically withdrawn from Cracow, Auschwitz, Plaszow? Or was it, perhaps,
essential to await Spielberg's talent? I feel, nevertheless, some pain and
some shame that it was not a Pole, someone from here, who dared to tackle
the subject.'
In much of the former communist world the story creates difficulties. In
some countries today to have had a record of working for the Nazis is a
certificate of anti-communism. Ordinary patriotism was suppressed by the
great slab of imperial socialism for 40 years and, today among the etiolated
weeds of nationalism creep those who thrived in the dark. There will be some
watching Schindler's List, in eastern Europe particularly, who will side
with the perpetrators rather than the victims.
But the question remains: why it should have taken so long for the events to
make such an impact.
Those who were responsible have now passed from positions of power and
influence. If you were a servant of the Reich and 20 in 1944 you were among
the last who could have behaved abominably. Today you would be 70. For three
or four decades after the war, the truth was kept at a distance as veterans
of mass-murder and collaboration took their positions at the helm of
industry, the judiciary and the civil service.
Today they have retired and horrors are revived that should have been
confronted a generation ago. As a result it is the grandchildren who suffer
a confrontation with history that the authors were spared.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Despatches: Where the wounds of war heal slowly - Leslie
Crawford travels through a battle-weary country / Mozambique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mozambique Island lost contact with civilisation during the 17-year civil
war which scarred the country to which it gave its name.
Cut off from mainland Mozambique by anti-government rebels and abandoned by
its Portuguese merchants, the small coral island only became accessible
again after news of a peace accord, signed in Rome, filtered back last year.
Until recently, it was imprudent to travel to Mozambique Island without the
protection of military escorts. Along the main road from Nampula, 100 miles
inland, the bus driver pointed out the wreckage of rebel attacks as if they
were scenic spots on a tourist route. Twenty-five peasants killed on a bend
of the road; a white farmer ambushed just beyond a rocky outcrop; whole
villages burned down and their men marched into the bush.
Curiously, the driver seemed to bear little resentment towards the 'bandits'
who had caused so much havoc. He even thought the Mozambique National
Resistance (Renamo) rebels might win the elections in October. The
government, he said, had stolen too much and people were tired of hearing
about foreign aid which never arrived.
While haggling continued over the terms of the peace accord in Maputo, the
capital far to the south, the war in Nampula was definitely over. There was
maize and cotton in the fields, new huts of baked red earth, and mangoes for
sale on the side of the road.
The island, like every settlement in Mozambique, was divided into an
'African' town of thatched huts and the 'stone-built' town of their colonial
masters. A mere 19 years of independence, most of it under Marxist rule, had
not been enough to erase five centuries of segregated urban planning.
The stone-built town was in ruins. Vast mansions of Portuguese, Arab and
Goan merchants had been stripped of everything that could be burned or
traded for fuel. The warehouses by the sea-front, built when Mozambique
Island was the busiest entrepot between Europe and the far east, were now
empty save for a few scavenging goats. The town council did its best to
preserve the old governor's palace, which had been a Jesuit monastery in the
17th century, but the roof leaked and there was no money to replaster the
crumbling exterior.
In spite of the decay, the stone-built town was inhabited by several hundred
refugees from the civil war. There were children everywhere, playing with
hoops. It began to rain and they splashed in puddles, and stood under broken
drainpipes for impromptu showers. I took refuge in a courtyard and watched
the rain cascade down a stone stairway.
There was no food at the inn, no electricity, and I was warned not to
venture out after dark. The islanders were afraid of vampires and threw
stones at strangers who prowled the streets at night.
Beira, along the coast to the south, was also plagued by power cuts and an
even bigger refugee crisis, although the belief in vampires did not seem to
form part of the local folklore there.
The fighting there reached the outskirts of town and the hotels, abandoned
by the Portuguese after independence, were overflowing with squatters. Few
buildings had running water. Refuse was left to rot on the streets. The port
and the railway corridor to Zimbabwe were working, thanks to millions of
dollars of foreign aid, but the resettlement of refugees had yet to begin.
On the outskirts of Beira, a tall, blonde woman was erecting tents for war
orphans, hundreds of whom live on the streets of Beira. Barbara Hofmann, a
32-year-old former Swiss banker, had spent three years trying to get
planning permission for a school and boarding house. As she was not prepared
to bribe the authorities, the permit was not forthcoming, so she looked
after her children in makeshift surroundings.
It was difficult to see the scars of war on these young faces. But Barbara
quietly named one or another and recited their traumas. Many saw their
parents being murdered; some were forced to take part in the gruesome
killings - a kind of 'psychological warfare' frequently practised by the
South African-backed rebels.
The received wisdom in Maputo was that Mozambique was tired of war, and that
the long-suffering peasantry would forgive the atrocities committed by
Renamo and the government. And against all expectations, the ceasefire has
now held for more than a year, while old enemies prepare to do battle in the
electoral arena.
The key to peace has been money - lots of it - liberally supplied by donor
governments, aid agencies and the UN. Peacekeeping in Mozambique has been
reduced to a cynical formula of financial inducements: belligerent generals
must be pensioned off; rival armies must be lured into UN assembly points
for demobilisation. Afonso Dhlakama, Renamo's leader, has to be given a big
enough campaign chest to persuade him to fight an election, which donors
will then ask him to lose.
The present government may be incompetent, but Dhlakama's rag-tag army of
bush fighters are not a reassuring alternative.
Mozambicans say they are witnessing the end of an era, a particularly cursed
one, without knowing what the new one will bring. The Marxist ideals which
carried Mozambique to independence have been discarded; South Africa, which
destabilised its neighbour to such devastating effect, is now Mozambique's
biggest trading partner. There is no shame attached to living from foreign
handouts, but equally no vestige of nationalist pride.
Old habits, however, die hard. At the Polana, one of the finest colonial
hotels in Africa, a white Mozambican lashes out at a porter for using the
informal 'tu'. 'Did you go to school with me?' the white man shouts in a
drunken rage, again and again. 'Learn to address your superiors with
respect.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: A Tuscan history lesson - The Arno and Tiber valleys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the forest you walk on velvet. The only sound along paths of deep-piled
leaf-mould is that of a beech leaf or prickly chestnut detaching itself.
Here in middle Tuscany you see no bird or animal, nothing on the move until
next Thursday when the forestry vehicle passes by. The occasional woodcutter
stares in amazement: 'What are you doing up here? Looking for mushrooms?'
You cross a clearing, the fairy ring of the charcoal- burners, a vanished
trade. You come to a silent village which has sprouted off the rock, under
the woodland canopy, as harmoniously as a clump of flowers.
The pink marsiglia pantiles, all askew, are reinforced with flagstones, the
lintels pitted with chisel marks, the doors tied up with old stockings and
the cracks in the bulging walls strapped with iron bands. A woman in peasant
black stares at you.
We are on the horseshoe curve of hills which encloses the Casentino, the
valley of the infant Arno river. From one side you might almost see the
domes of Florence, from the other the tower blocks of Rimini. Up the valley
a road and a light railway crawl this way and that, looking for the Arno's
source. One or two roads struggle up to the watershed and, at summit level,
you can park your car and walk into that rarest of modern Italian qualities
 -solitude.
History ancient and modern is locked up in these hills. On a small road
above Arezzo we explored La Verna's rock-cut monastery, important in the
life of St Francis of Assisi. Displayed here are his staff, rope girdle,
sandals and flagella. On Sundays the place is thronged. Several hundred sit
down to lunch which, being prepared by the monks, is cheap and ghastly.
I walked the Pratomagno or 'Great Meadow,' starting at Vallombrosa where
Milton played the organ. The switchback trail along the tops begins at a
lonely rifugio where huntsmen, at 8am, were drinking brandy and cursing the
mist. It was misty all the way. Long before I saw it I heard the wind
whistling through the latticework of the Croce di Pratomagno.
Nearby I located the stone which commemorates Bert Hinkler, long-distance
aviator and native of Queensland. A wreath of flowers lies there,
camouflaged in fallen leaves. The Australian ambassador had been up there a
few days earlier in a helicopter, marking the 60th anniversary of the night
when Hinkler in his Puss Moth, en route from Croydon in England to Sydney,
crashed into the mountains. Two months later, when the snows had melted, a
shepherd found the wreckage and a search party found the body, some distance
away, partly eaten by foxes.
From heights like these you look down on the Casentino with its steady
stream of traffic and a rail-car which stops at every wayside halt. Down
there, promiscuous housing spreads over the fields where Dante fought in the
last battle of the civil wars. Down there, light industry pollutes the
Casentino brooks which, in Dante's Inferno, tormented souls longed for.
Italy's economic growth has transformed rural Tuscany. It is hard in that
semi-industrial scene to pick out the box-like 12th-century towers of the
Guidi counts which dot the course of the Arno.
Never mind. It is still haunted, hallowed ground. This district was the
seed-plot of Renaissance genius. Pratovecchio, terminus of the little train,
gave birth to Paolo Uccello, whose Battle of San Romano used to hang over
Lorenzo de' Medici's bed.
Masaccio, enfant terrible of the Florence art scene (his name meant 'Wicked
Tom'), was born at Loro Ciuffenna on the Pratomagno. Vicchio, just beyond
the horseshoe of the hills, was the cradle of Giotto. From the valley towns
came Vasari and Petrarch (Arezzo), Luca Signorelli and Fra Angelico
(Cortona).
Both the Arno and Tiber rise in these hills. On a green-topped hill between
them sits Caprese Michelangelo, crowned with a feudal castle. I walked into
the bar and asked the barmaid, aged about 12: 'Who is this Michelangelo?'
'I don't understand you.'
'You have a Michelangelo birthplace, a Michelangelo bar. Who is he? Some
politician?'
The child took a deep breath. 'He was no less than the greatest artist who
ever lived. If you could see his works, signore, you would say they were
done not by the hand of man but by the hand of God.'
He was born there by accident; he does not really belong to the local
pantheon. His mother was making her way to Rome when a thunderstorm
frightened the horses. The carriage overturned and she went into labour. The
Buonarotti family owned the local castello, so she stayed there until the
baby was born. In the 1920s the government started dignifying place-names
with the names of native celebrities - Sasso Marconi, Arqua Petrarca, Torre
del Lago Puccini. Caprese became Caprese Michelangelo.
The local hero, however, is not Michelangelo but Piero della Francesca, born
at Sansepolcro. His works are scattered over the countryside in churches,
cemetery chapels and dusty municipal halls. Often they are protected by
nothing more than a frayed rope and the jealous piety of villagers. When
Charles de Gaulle persuaded the mayor of Monterchi to lend Piero's Madonna
del Parto for a Paris exhibition, women lay in the road and refused to let
it go.
Sansepolcro has Piero's Resurrection, which Aldous Huxley considered the
finest painting in the world, but this artist's supreme legacy was the
series of frescoes which illustrates The Legend of the Cross at Arezzo, on
the walls of what looks like a disused barn but is really the old church of
San Francesco.
The Casentino and upper Tiber valley, popular with Italian weekend tourists
and art students, are not much penetrated by foreigners. A bungaloid rash,
and the quarries and new roads which disfigure the Pratomagno slopes, do not
encourage exploration. In 20 years this has become a different world, but a
few communities remain intact. The flagged lanes of Poppi; the perfect
defensive ring of Anghiari's walls; the whole town of Sansepolcro inside its
gates and the upper town of Arezzo haven't changed in seven centuries.
The stone sockets of town houses blossom with banners on days of
celebration. At weekends the crossbowmen and flag-jugglers sustain ancient
rivalries in explosive encounters; for the rest of the time the citizens
move serenely and aimlessly about - 'Like fish in an aquarium,' I suggested.
'Like characters in Piero's paintings,' said my guide.
Arezzo's hotels are cheaper and less sophisticated than those of Florence;
nevertheless, at the Minerva, Etrusco or Continentale you may pay up to
Pounds 60 a night. Sansepolcro's best, in a picturesque setting, is La
Balestra, about Pounds 40 a night. There are serious parking problems in
this town.
Most villages of the Casentino have adequate small hotels, sometimes
attached to gourmet restaurants, sometimes closed in winter. Notable among
them are Parc Hotel at Poppi (Pounds 40), Buca di Michelangelo at Caprese
(Pounds 26), Fonte della Galletta at Alpe Faggeto (Pounds 28), Oliver at
Anghiari (Pounds 36) and Croce di Savoia at Vallombrosa (Pounds 45). All
these places are in red Michelin.
For walkers and cyclists among the hills, almost every hamlet has its
locanda (private lodging house) at under Pounds 12 a night, including food.
All Casentino and Tiber valley localities have bus connections with Arezzo
and Sansepolcro, at least once a day.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Care to share? Life on Siberia's frontier - At her
room in the 'bureaucratic hotel' in Kemerovo Lori Cidylo is taken aback by
an uninvited companion . . .

In the frozen vastness of Siberia, the air singes your cheek and your breath
freezes into a cluster of shimmering ice crystals that Siberians call the
whisper of stars. As the first flush of daylight bursts through, life in the
forest begins to stir. The pine trees stretch their limbs as the snow starts
to melt under the first rays of the sun. A white hare pops out of a
snow-covered hollow and twitches its pink nose, sniffing the air.
Ruddy-cheeked women, heavily bundled against the cold, emerge from log
cabins to traverse country roads in search of firewood while burly men in
fur caps cut holes in the ice of a frozen lake and thrust their fishing
poles into its depths.
In this land of legend and adventure, where the temperature can fall to  -
50`C, amazing things can happen. Steel cranes can snap in mid-air and
camera-film shatter like crystal.
Life in Siberia is evocative of life in the US in the days of the open
frontier. Many people have no telephones or running water. Water is trucked
in once a week and must be hauled from wells which often freeze in winter.
Galina Pushkaryova, a typically buxom Siberian with an iron constitution,
could hardly suppress her laughter when she opened her front door and saw me
standing there wrapped in so many layers, including two pairs of gloves,
that only my eyes were visible - and still I could not stop shivering.
Quickly she pulled me inside, and soon I was sitting in front of a fire
sampling some of the many exotic dishes Siberian cuisine has to offer.
Galina spread a lavish table which included home-made goose soup, pyelmyeni
(similar to Italian ravioli, but without the tomato sauce), and black bread,
before bringing out some elk meat and a bottle of throat-searing vodka.
'One shot of this and soon you'll be walking around without gloves,' Galina
said with a wink as she downed a glass with gusto.
'Siberians have a saying: if a person doesn't drink, he must be either very
ill or a complete scoundrel,' said Valentina Rumantseva, a local doctor.
Many Siberians start the day by dousing themselves with a pitcher of
ice-cold water. Local wisdom has it that this ritual strengthens the body's
immunity. Indeed, even the youngest natives seem to thrive. Siberian
children can toboggan before they can walk. When the barometer dips very
low, they spill water to form a slick sheet of ice in front of their houses,
and spend hours playing ice hockey.
Siberia is not a republic, and has no definite borders. It begins roughly at
the Ural mountains and runs eastwards for thousands of miles of forest
steppe, tiger and tundra. Yet there must be scarcely a person alive who does
not know what Siberia is and where it is - certainly no Russian.
Siberia occupies a unique place in the Russian soul. It is a well-spring of
romance, adventure, suffering and dread. Many of its people are the
descendants of those who were forced to travel there by train or on foot,
sometimes in chains, to live in the dark reaches of exile.
The city of Kemerovo had several prison camps. But there are other reminders
of the past. The huge chemical factories that made the city an industrial
giant during the Soviet era are still among the main sources of employment.
Siberia has no tourist attractions. Indeed, one can easily be lured into
treacherous wilds from which there may be no escape. 'The forest looks very
beautiful, but it is also very dangerous,' said Galina. 'If you were to go
inside, it would be almost impossible to find your way out because, to an
inexperienced eye, each path looks exactly the same. Your chances of
survival would be very slim. You would either die from cold and hunger or
you would be devoured by wild animals.'
There are many novel ways to quench your thirst for adventure which are
quite harmless. One is the banya po chornomu or 'black bath', the Siberian
sauna, a unique experience which Siberians believe can relieve almost
anything that ails you, from bronchitis to a bad heart.
'It's a feeling you won't forget,' said Tatiana Novikova, a local
entrepreneur, of the sauna's effects both on psyche and body. 'Afterwards,
you can run in the snow barefoot and you won't even feel the cold.'
Unable to resist the promise of such a treat, our group, which consisted of
four Germans, three Russians and one American, piled into a Jeep and drove
in search of a famed local sauna once reserved for the communist elite and
now frequented by the post-Soviet jet set.
At last we discovered a cosy, lace-curtained log cabin hidden among a covey
of trees. Inside, we were greeted by the scent of fresh pine. Obeying
Tatiana's instructions, we wrapped ourselves in sheets and donned hats to
keep our hair from getting scorched. Soon, we were sitting on wooden planks
in a steaming hot cocoon, inhaling the dry, pine-scented air.
The prescription is precise: one shot of vodka followed by a massage, a cold
shower and two hours in the sauna. But the curative effect is ensured only
after the final step. After emerging from the sauna, dripping wet, Siberians
often take a roll in the snow, in the buff. Being a modest lot, we omitted
that bit.
After the sauna, I decided to return to my hotel and relax before dinner,
but there was a complication: I could not recall the name of my hotel. So I
called Galina, who had made the reservation for me. 'This is rather
embarrassing,' I said, but can you tell me the name of my hotel?'
'It doesn't have a name,' she said.
Finally, I found it. It took half-an-hour. I was beginning to suspect it had
no address, either. I asked the clerk if it really had no name.
Surprised at my question, the clerk, an old woman, replied: 'Yes, it's
true.' The hotel was what is known as a vedomstvennaya gostinitsa, literally
a 'bureaucratic hotel,' and turned out to be as nightmarish as it sounded.
Such hotels, I learned, are affiliated to a particular enterprise, in this
case a factory, and are frequented by people who come to work there
temporarily. Reservations are made by the employee's nachalnik (boss). A
call from such a highly-placed personage and a room is assured; the
management has no right to refuse.
On my second day at the hotel, the clerk informed me that a woman had just
arrived and was staying in my room. Since I was expecting a friend from
Moscow, I was sure it must be her. I bounded up the stairs and rapped on the
door.
'Tanya, it's me.'
'Just a minute.'
When the door opened, I found myself face to face with a stout matron in her
mid-50s who regarded me severely. We stood motionless. 'Excuse me,' I
ventured, 'I think I have the wrong room.' I checked the number on the door.
No 8: my room. So who was this woman?
She told me that her name was Yelena and that she had come to work at the
factory affiliated to the hotel. I asked the clerk if there was anything to
be done about this distressing situation. The answer was negative. 'All I do
is take orders,' she explained.
I returned to my room. 'Don't worry. I won't bother you a bit,' said my new
friend, who was already in bed and puffing a cigarette, creating noxious
rings of smoke. Her clothes were strewn across the floor. 'You won't even
notice that I'm here.' Shortly after that she was snoring like a chainsaw.
To get to Siberia from London you can travel to Moscow with British Airways.
From Moscow, only Aeroflot, the former Soviet airline, goes to Siberia. In
Kemerovo there are three real hotels, not affiliated to any enterprise: the
Tom Hotel, the Tsentralniy Hotel and the Kuzbass Hotel, which is the best of
the three. Aeroflot is at 70 Piccadilly, London W1 V9HH. Tel: 071-491-1764.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Biblical moments in muddy Madeira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES WHITTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An accordianist wandered among the tables. He smiled benignly as the rain
slammed against the glass wall. The waiter in his turquoise tux brought the
crab and crevettes as the wind whined through the leading. We asked to move
tables. No trouble at all. The wine and ice-bucket followed us like shadows.
We sipped 1906 Malmsey after coffee and stumbled happily back to the hotel
over decorative cobbles, thinking that the wind always made Madeira's palm
trees dance like dervishes.
Next morning, Funchal's esplanade was under an inch of mud. The famous tidal
pool at Reid's Hotel had rocks in it. The previous night's wind was being
called a typhoon. Eight people had died trying to save their boat and a
Mercedes sports coupe had surfed out of its showroom and down a flooded
river-bed to the beach.
You expect a bit of rain on Madeira as the price of its almost unnatural
greenness. (It is on the same latitude as Saharan Morocco.) Even if the
brochure chose not to mention it, the umbrella stands in every shop are a
giveaway. But this was more than a bit. This was biblical.
We had come to walk the levadas - irrigation channels which contour
Madeira's terraced inland slopes. Easy paths along the channels give
spectacular views and the illusion of taking exercise, we had been told, in
return for minimal effort. But the levadas, too, were blocked or flooded, or
both. Poor old 'Pearl of the Atlantic'.
National service cadets shovelled mud off the seafront. Human chains
baled-out shops. Old men and young women looked on enthralled and rescue
helicopters danced dangerously in the wind. We slithered to the market. The
overnight catch seemed to have been a bumper one. Whole tuna lay on marble
slabs being cut into steaks by brigands with scimitars, which they slid
along the fish until the buyer said 'cut'.
Tuna are handsome, fish-shaped fish, their reputation much harmed by tins.
Espada are not. Long, black, eel-like and ugly, they are nevertheless
Madeira's staple protein, caught close inshore with the help of powerful
lights to attract them. Espada taste of little, which may be why they are
often cooked with local bananas.
Out of the fish-hall, through a separate market full of mangoes, guavas,
passion fruit and custard apples, still it rained. The kind of laden clouds
that race in off the English Channel to test your compass skills on Exmoor
were wrapped round Funchal's upper suburbs.
In the cobbled old town, the Madeira Wine Company was doing rain-proof
tastings. We toured the old wine lodge, breathed its sweet, alcoholic air,
and glugged full glasses, not mere soupcons, of the century's choicest
vintages. Then we repaired through the rain to the deserted but immaculate
English Church.
Madeira is part of a strange archipelago: 150 miles south of the main
island, usefully extending Portugal's territorial waters to within 100 miles
of the Canaries, are the Selvagens - three tiny desert islands where Sir
Ernest Shackleton believed Captain Kidd buried his treasure.
Within sight of Funchal to the south are three more uninhabited lumps and, a
10-minute flight away on the eastern horizon, there is Porto Santo. Joao
Goncalves Zarco arrived there in 1418 after being blown off course while
exploring the West African coast for Prince Henry the Navigator.
Incredibly, he took a year to discover Madeira. It must have been a foggy
year because on a clear day you can see one island from the other. The best
view Zarco had was of a mountain of grey cloud which he thought presaged the
end of the world.
On our way to Funchal airport the taxi-driver had said: 'Porto Santo - good
for one day.' In the circumstances, he was right. Where Madeira is green,
Porto Santo is khaki. Where Madeira rises sheer from the ocean, Porto Santo
tilts out of it like a listing wreck. Where Madeira has a bustling and
lucrative life beyond tourism, Porto Santo just has its beach.
We arrived in a twin-engined Dornier turbo-prop, diving alarmingly towards
the runway that bisects the island. The beach was being pounded by breakers.
Yachts en route to Venezuela from Southampton were battened down in the lee
of the sea wall, lucky to have made it there.
The young bloods of Porto Santo raced their mopeds along the front, leaning
into the cross-wind. We walked to a chapel on a hill with views of pure
Atlantic, then returned to Funchal in the Dornier with the under-16 football
team, which had a Sunday fixture.
A miracle had been performed in our absence. The clouds were gone. The roads
had been cleared. The air was still and warm. Madeira looked like an
emerald. We took a bus over the Camara de Lobos, Europe's highest cliff and
a subject of water-colours by Winston Churchill.
His preferred viewpoint is now a cement works but beyond the cliff, squeezed
into the mouth of a gorge, the town of Ribeira Brava cannot have changed
much since the 1950s. This is the last stop for coffee, petrol and obeisance
(at the 16th century church of Sao Bento) before the grand trans-montane to
the north.
'Grand' is not too grand a word, even though Madeira is no bigger than the
Isle of Man. The road is a miniaturisation of those that climb from the
Amazon into the Andes. The vegetation is as thick and the slopes are as
steep. From the pass, called Encumeada, the ocean is visible north and south
and the path along the levada del norte wriggles away through conifers to
the west.
Coach-loads of day trippers go there but so do serious walkers. You can tell
them by their miners' lamps, which are switched on in the 30 miles of
tunnels the levadas use. (Fearing vampires, we tried scrambling round one
mountain-side instead, and came terrifyingly close to falling off it.)
What they say about Madeira, to attract the young and the young-at-heart, is
true: there is more to it than bridge and tea-dancing and strong, sweet
wine. Just be sure to pack a torch and an umbrella.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Light fantastic - Why artists colonised a remote
Danish fishing village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skagen is the most northerly tip of Denmark. As you head up through the rich
farmland of Jutland, the country thins out and turns east, tapering to a
windblown sandy finger that points across to Sweden.
The Skagen peninsula separates two fearsome-sounding seas, the Skaggerak in
the North Sea and the Kattegat, the beginnings of the Baltic. Skagen has a
name in English - a somehow threatening word - the Skaw. Certainly the area
was a danger to sailors once: the Skaw has claimed many ships on its sands.
Skagen is no longer threatening and remote, but it was its remoteness 100
years ago that attracted a group of painters. They came to what was a tiny
fishing village in order to escape the stultifying formality of Copenhagen's
salons. Starting in the 1870s, many Nordic painters decamped there each
summer, forming a sort of artists' colony where they would paint and make
merry.
The Skagen painters are known particularly for their treatment of light. Any
visitor to Skagen will discover that the light has a startling clarity and
brightness - a combination of clear sea air and sunlight reflected off the
two seas and vast expanses of sand.
Summer days are long that far north (Skagen is level with Inverness), and
there is a magical moment each evening at about 10pm, called l'heure bleue,
when the light dissolves into a blue haze between night and day.
The most famous picture produced by the Skagen painters is Summer Evening on
the South Beach at Skagen. Two women in long white dresses are walking on
the strand; the folds in the sand are lit by late-evening sunlight and their
dresses appear almost illuminated. Behind them the sea and sky are an
indistinguishable blue. It was painted 100 years ago by P S Kroyer, perhaps
the finest of the Skagen painters.
I went there in November, when there was an un-summerly chill and it was
dark by 5pm. The town of Skagen has expanded - boats no longer put out from
the beach as they do in the paintings, but from a large fishing and ferry
port. The town has spread into small suburbs.
But the cluster of houses of the old town are charming and pretty, with a
very Nordic neatness. Most of the old houses are single-storey, with ochre
walls and orange roof-tiles, their window-frames and eaves picked out in
white. They are couched in tidy gardens behind white picket fences and
nearly all have a flag-pole. On holidays the Danes fly long double-tapered
flags like medieval standards.
Even in November the light is clear and strong. I found that it had a
curious, invigorating effect, bestowing the delicious, if irrational,
feeling of confident expectation that I normally associate with the onset of
spring. I had prepared myself for melancholy; instead there was a spring in
my step. I could see why painters liked Skagen so much.
Kroyer's Summer Evening hangs in the Skagen museum, which tells the story of
the artists through their paintings. The town itself is central to their
work; there are scenes of fishermen launching their boats and scenes of home
life. The artists also painted one another, and Kroyer was a leader in their
Bohemian revelries.
If the artists came to escape Copenhagen society, the salons soon followed
them. The railway arrived in 1890, the smart Copenhageners built their
seaside villas and Skagen became a chic place to be. The Danish royal family
built a summer palace and royal families visited from all over Europe.
The town has lost its Bohemian feel; there are only a few painters now, and
writers and actors tend to live in private villas, but there is a pleasant
seaside feel and a number of attractive old hotels.
The Skagen painters never amounted to a 'school'. Over the 40 years that the
town flourished, they used widely differing styles and techniques. Some were
realist, almost naturalist in their depiction of the fishermen's simple
lives; others were clearly influenced by the impressionists. There are even
snatches of dour Danish formality in imitation of Dutch masters.
Brondums Hotel still holds pride of place in Skagen. There is a pleasant
antique air about the dining room and reception rooms. They are lined with
dark wood panelling and some original paintings still hang on the walls. I
crept in one afternoon to flee the cold and was working my way through a pot
of hot chocolate when three impossibly tall brunettes tripped in, wearing
evening dress and overcoats, as though they had lost their way en route to a
Copenhagen dinner party.
They chatted furtively in a language I did not understand. It all seemed a
little unlikely for 3pm, particularly when one of the girls flashed me a
wicked smile and started to undress.
All was explained a moment later when the stylist came bounding in - they
were models - and started touching-up their outfits, before despatching
them, one by one, into the cold. The light in Skagen is so good, even in
November, that photographers travel there for fashion shoots.
James Henderson flew to Denmark with Maersk Air (London tel: 071-333-0066),
which has twice-daily links from Gatwick to Copenhagen and to Billund in
Jutland.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Rathlin: an island apart from Ulster - A
bird-watcher's paradise off the north coast of Antrim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It must be like the FA Cup for them,' Tony from Manchester mused as we
watched the model yachts tacking across Ushet Lough.
A laconic furniture remover and keen amateur photographer, Tony was busy
with his filters and lenses as contestants in waders and with long poles
cajoled their boats to out-perform the rest. The prize for the winner was
the Rinever Trophy, named after one of the districts on Rathlin Island.
For the 40 island families, the yacht races - held half-a-dozen times a year
 -are keenly contested. The trophies take pride of place on islanders'
mantelpieces. A triangular course is chosen according to the prevailing
wind. The yachts must reach the shore on the other side of the water,
between two flags; contestants then reset the sails and point them in the
next direction. The race can take from 20 minutes to five hours.
The winning yacht was owned by Dominic McCurdy, who runs Rathlin Island's
only guesthouse. Father MacAteer, the local priest (90 per cent of the
islanders are Roman Catholic), used a megaphone to address the assembled
racers (nine), supporters (15) and visitors (Tony and me). He congratulated
the winner and presented the trophy.
Rathlin is six miles off the north Antrim coast and is Ulster's only
inhabited island, having been so since at least the Neolithic period -
4,000BC to 2,500BC.
In its earliest history, Rathlin must have been comparatively prosperous.
Because of a geological accident, the Neolithic islanders had a thriving
export business. A plug of molten lava forced its way to the surface
millions of years ago and the heat changed, or metamorphosed, the rock
immediately surrounding it.
Known as porcellanite, or recrystallised bauxitic lithomarge, by geologists,
the early farmers, who had given up hunting to till the land, found it just
the job for making axes to cut down trees.
At Brockley, towards the west end of the island, was the axe factory, and
the blades have been found throughout Ireland, in Scotland and Wales and as
far away as north Kent. Along with flint arrow-heads and scrapers made from
nodules taken from the limestone cliffs, axe-heads and blanks are still
quite a common find on the island.
Because it is only 16 miles from the Mull of Kintyre, the Scottish lords of
the isles, the McDonnells, ruled Rathlin for many years. The English
naturally disputed this, and bloody clashes often took place.
But one dispute, in the 17th century, was settled by argument rather than by
the sword. It was claimed that Rathlin was 'a parcel of Ireland (because)
the nature of its soil . . . neither breeds nor nourishes any living thing
venomous'.
The snakeless argument is interesting. Several centuries earlier it was used
to settle a similar dispute over ownership of the Isle of Man. The Normans
introduced venomous reptiles on a trial basis: they lived, and as a matter
of course the island was unanimously judged to belong to England, not
Ireland.
What Churchill referred to as 'the most celebrated spider known to history'
is reputed to have been a Rathlin specimen. Robert the Bruce is supposed to
have sought sanctuary in a cave only accessible by boat, and then only when
the tide is right. The 14th century arachnologist must have had very good
eyesight - and/or a very long candle - as the cave is not only long and
narrow but has a very high ceiling.
Ornithologists are attracted to Rathlin especially in the breeding season.
The smell of guano is all-pervasive as thousands of guillemots, razorbills,
cormorants, shags and species of gull stake out their breeding nooks and
jostle on the narrow ledges each summer.
Other visitors go to study or enjoy rare plants such as the pyramidal bugle,
or swathes of orchids that carpet the unimproved grassland. It is also a
popular place for divers - off Rathlin are some of Britain's deepest waters
and underwater cliffs, as well as numerous wrecks, including HMS Drake,
flagship of the British Navy in the first world war, torpedoed and sunk in
Church Bay.
The activity centre on the island has been designed with divers in mind, but
anyone interested in outdoor activities is welcomed. The building is the
tithe barn of the former owners of the island, the Gage family, who also
used to own the adjacent manor house, which is being converted into a 15-bed
hotel.
The money for these developments has come from various government and
European Union grants, and from the Rathlin Trust, set up in 1987 to arrest
the island's slow economic decline. The trust received a windfall in its
first year. Richard Branson landed in the sea near Rathlin on July 3 1987
after crossing the Atlantic by balloon. Islander Tommy Cecil got a line on
the floundering balloon, the traditional way to carry out salvage at sea.
Instead of claiming the value of the balloon, Tommy asked for a donation to
the trust. A month later Branson returned (by helicopter) and presented a
cheque for Pounds 25,000.
In 1992, electricity came to Rathlin - provided by wind turbines on the hill
overlooking Church Bay. The grand switch-on was attended by the Reverend Ian
Paisley, the local MP. When it was his turn to say a few words, he began:
'The Lord said: 'Let there be light' . . . but it sure took a long time to
come to Rathlin.'
Weather permitting, there are daily sailings leaving Ballycastle on the
north Antrim coast at 10.30am and Rathlin at 4pm; passengers only, no cars,
Pounds 3.15 one way. Accommodation: The Manor House (hotel), details from
the Rathlin Island Trust, tel: 02657-63920. The Guest House (BB): Mr and
Mrs McCurdy, tel: 02657-63917. The Richard Branson Activity Centre (hostel),
tel: 02657-63915. There is a free camping site at Church Bay harbour.

FT  12 MAR 94 / How To Spend It: Take two kitchens and stir very carefully -
If you can't stand the heat . . . delegate when decision-making in the home.
Lucia van der Post on two radical examples of refurbishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those who own old and beautiful houses the challenge of respecting the
antiquity, tradition and fabric of the building, while acquiring a few
modern comforts and technology is sometimes overwhelming.
Nowhere is the potential contradiction between old and new-fangled worlds
more difficult to resolve than in the kitchen.
Notions of the ideal kitchen vary and the skilled kitchen refurbisher can
dabble in them all, from sleek city slicker to rural rustic dream, from
pastel Provencal to a touch of tribal primitive. Kitchens are often the
repository of romantic dreams.
Even in this day and age, when the cooking of Lady Sieff (aka Marks 
Spencer) is in such hot demand, and when many a family relies on what in
America are known as 'food contacts', instead of roasts and proper puddings,
the kitchen is still seen as the centre of family life.
Yuppies, who rush home merely to lay down their heads before ordering a
take-away, lovingly plan replicas of Tuscan kitchens. In urban loft-houses,
those who have only come upon bruschetta on a restaurant menu, happily order
wooden counter-tops.
But the one thing that they all have in common is that the romantic dream
has to be reconciled with technical requirements. Even the most rustic of
modern kitchens needs a cooker, a fridge, a freezer, plugs for kettles and
toasters, work surfaces that are easy to clean and storage space. For
others, espresso machines, juicers and microwaves are also essential.
The Douglas Stephen Partnership, of The Annex, 140-142 St John Street,
London EC1V 4JT (tel: 071-336-7884) was recently asked to provide a kitchen
for a grand Jacobean house in Suffolk. The house is lovely, a Grade I listed
building, and structural changes have to be approved by English Heritage and
the local planning authority. In the event, very little of the main
structure was altered - one doorway was moved slightly.
The architects decided that there was no point in trying to be slavishly
faithful to the period - an impossibility as the Jacobean kitchen is so
different to our own - or to recreate too olde worlde a country-house
kitchen. Instead, they tackled the problem by imbuing the overall design
with an air of solidity and grandeur.
The kitchen had not been touched for years and needed to be completely
gutted. The house is lived in by a family with three young children and the
brief was to provide a very useful, fully-equipped area for family use that
matched the mood of the house.
There were two main constraints - one was that the family had a vast
American Amana fridge/freezer, which could not be hidden behind wooden
cupboards. This led to the decision to keep most of the rest of the
equipment visible as a counterbalance to the fridge. A black Aga was already
positioned across one corner and this was flanked by two smaller cabinets,
leaving the centre of the room open for the kitchen table. The owner was
insistent on a square-edge, straight-sided Belfast sink.
The kitchen had several low windows which meant it was impractical to put in
rows of cabinets. No-one liked the notion of a gleaming modern 'Euro'
kitchen so, free-standing units, new versions of the traditional dressers
and side-boards, were combined with some fitted cabinets.
The kitchen is a tall room and the height was broken by using the client's
collection of pottery around the room. A glass shelf was used for the
collection to give the impression of a frieze and the lights help to give
the idea that the glass floats above the cabinets.
Lots of storage space was sought and, as you can see from one of the
photographs below, at least one of the doors has storage on the inside.
The kitchen had to be replastered and repainted. A yellow-ochre lime-wash
was used on the walls. The floor had to be redone. Large, terracotta tiles
from China - each looks hand-made and slightly uneven  - were used so the
effect is of great age. With the use of low-voltage lights and the splendid
collection of ceramic pots the entire kitchen looks as if has been there for
years.
Simon Stocker of Stocker Furniture, 191-197 Archway Road, London N6 5BN
(081-341-7322) was responsible for all the timber work and the glass
shelves. He used limed oak for the casing, dressers and sideboards, and
chunky oiled teak for the worktops, which gives an air of great solidity.
The handles on the cabinet doors have a resolutely industrial air - made
from sleek, polished stainless steel they come from Elementa, the
architectural ironmongers.
As Simon Stocker puts it: 'The whole is a very successful blend of modern
design using glass and polished stainless steel with a respectful
genuflexion to the past with the use of limed oak for the cabinets and a
generous three inches of teak for the work tops.
'It was a joy to make and I love it.'
This kind of kitchen, of course, does not come cheap. All the cabinet work
was specially made and Simon Stocker's work alone came to about Pounds
19,000.
Then, of course, there was the replastering, the repainting, the flooring
and the cost of the very expensive, state-of-the art equipment.
Not all the costs can be separated out - the builders were also restoring
the rest of the house - but around Pounds 40,000 would probably be near the
ultimate cost.

FT  12 MAR 94 / How To Spend It: Kindred kitchen spirit - If you can't stand
the heat . . . delegate when decision-making in the home. Lucia van der Post
on two radical examples of refurbishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Anthony Worrall Thompson, the chef behind those chic London eateries, dell'
Ugo and 190 Queensgate, asked Mark Wilkinson to update the kitchen in his
own house, an Edwardian cottage near the Thames in Oxfordshire.
Wilkinson is not only a provider of made-to-measure kitchens, but does most
of the cooking for his family. Therefore Worrall Thompson felt he might find
a kindred spirit who would understand his needs.
The inspiration for the kitchen came from a little house which was built for
Queen Victoria's children at Osborne on the Isle of Wight. He felt the
cottage inspired him to think of Edwardian shooting lodges, cellar kitchens
in Edwardian London, Elgar, the Malvern Hills and a host of other
traditional English images. From these images he designed a kitchen which
had the feel of an old kitchen in a country house, but was not strictly
traditional.
'As a professional chef,' says Wilkinson, 'I knew he was going to be very
demanding on the kitchen physically, lots of bashing and kneading, so I had
to give him something strong and unfussy.
'As the front door opens straight into the kitchen it is clearly the most
important and emphatic room in the house, more important than the
sitting-room, so it was vital that it was welcoming and attractive as well
as functional. We put a heavy working area around the sinks and appliances
down one side and the large-scale storage down the other.'
Catering-sized equipment - as with Simon Stocker's clients, Worrall Thompson
insisted on a giant Amana fridge/freezer and a Belfast sink and taps - had
to be housed, so plain sturdy doors and stainless steel working surfaces
were a solid balance for their bulk. The cupboards all look sturdy and solid
and have handsome curved ends. Adjoining and leading into the kitchen is the
dining area. From there the living room opens up. The whole feel is of a
well-loved, much lived-in room.
The range of cabinets, finished in eggshell cream and with heavy rosewood
handles, is from Mark Wilkinson's latest range, which he calls Cooks'
Kitchen. Having offered us more elaborate decorative options in the past,
ranging from 'A Taste of Provence' to the 'Santa Fe' look and any number of
painted finishes, Mark Wilkinson now felt in need of a simpler approach to
kitchen design.
Cooks' Kitchen has the solid feel of an old-fashioned Edwardian house, a
kitchen in a real country house. Its working kitchen atmosphere is
reinforced by the surfaces - some made from extra-thick maple, some from
stainless steel and a granite inset in Giallo Veneziano.
The floor is made of wide, stripped pine floorboards. On one wall,
reinforcing Wilkinson's imagery from Albion England, are some decorative
murals of English rural life (workers in the fields, by Samantha Allkins),
which are meant to convey the feeling of exuberance and joy in the
countryside.
On the other wall are some primitive animal paintings, as well as some
peppers and tomatoes, as perhaps befits a prime purveyor of Mediterranean
peasant dishes.
All Mark Wilkinson's kitchens are made-to-measure. This one cost about
Pounds 19,000, including the Amana Fridge/freezer but excluding the French
Morice cooker.
Mark Wilkinson has showrooms at: 126 Holland Park Avenue, London W11 (tel:
071-727 5814); 13 Holywell Hill, St Albans, Herts AL1 1EZ (0727-40975); and
a new one at 41 St John's Wood High Street, London NW8. His headquarters are
at Overton House, High Street, Bromham, Wilts SN15 2HA. (0380-850004).

FT  12 MAR 94 / Fashion (The Global Wardrobe - At a Wedding): The bride

One of the ironies of French life is that for a country in which adultery is
virtually a national institution, the ritual of the wedding ceremony is
taken very, very seriously.
The smartest French weddings take place in the old country homes of the
bride's family. Yet every Saturday, the streets of Paris are filled with
honking horns as drivers 'salute' the bridal cars - with white ribbons tied
around the radio aerials - on their way to the local mairie or church.
The men at society weddings are still kitted out in morning suits. But
French morning suits, unlike the British version, are expected to be in mint
condition and French men are fond of ensuring that all the male guests sport
matching ties and buttonholes.
Parisians also like to liven up their lounge suits on less formal occasions
with elaborate waistcoats. Hermes' intricately printed silk waistcoats, with
co-ordinating ties and handkerchieves, are popular as are Koji Tatsuno's
woven silk waistcoats and Yohji Yamamoto's embroidered suits.
The female guests are expected to be visions of chic. The outfit itself is
often kept as simple as possible so that it can be topped off with a really
resplendent hat: the bigger the brim the better. Snappy little
pastel-coloured Chanel suits are popular - or long, flowing frocks for more
bohemian weddings.
The high-society bride herself will almost certainly wear a dress made for
the day by her favourite designer. And no truly chic Parisian wedding would
be complete without the designer in attendance to preen for the
photographers and fuss over the frock.
One model who got married in Paris this summer appointed John Galliano in
the dual role of dress designer and chief attendant. He rose to the occasion
by donning a rakish hat and orchid buttonhole to whisk her train along the
aisle.

The wedding reception is a grand affair in Japan and one of the very few
occasions that calls for serious dressing up.
The Japanese take it for granted that looking elegant for a wedding
celebration is a must, regardless of cost.
The bride's family will typically spend at least Y100,000 (Pounds 635) on
hiring a traditional bride's kimono, if they do not own one, and guests will
also readily hire formal outfits.
To keep up with the bride, who will change from a traditional kimono to a
western style wedding dress and then a formal gown, women guests favour
glamorous gowns that are only tolerated for the most formal of events.
There is a difference, however, in rules for married and single women.
Although not necessarily strictly adhered to, it is generally expected that
young, single women will wear a rented ballgown or a silk kimono,
beautifully embroidered in gold, vermillion, purple and other bright colours
and featuring various nature motifs. These long-sleeved kimonos are called
furisode.
Western-style gowns will feature costly materials of all hues, beads,
spangles, or lace and will often be worn in the winter with ostrich
mufflers, long gloves and all.
Married women tend not to wear full gowns and generally opt for something
more subdued. And in the case of kimonos, there is a strict code that
married women do not wear furisode. Instead, they wear a black kimono
embroidered in gold with the family crest visibly presented.
Jewellery is always in abundance among the women, married or not, and pearls
are favoured this year.
As for the men, weddings do not provide the same opportunities for dressing
up: morning coats were the rule, and still are on the whole, although
younger men are experimenting with stylish tuxedos.
The problem with tuxedos however, is that since the only people who wear
them outside wedding receptions are usually waiters, it is not difficult to
be mistaken for one.

Ken and Barbie time comes round again sooner than you can say 'chiffon'. The
Frankfurt wedding season, heavily concentrated as elsewhere in the
springtime, provides opportunities for all involved to dress up in a fashion
which reflects the diverse influences at play in an essentially central
European city where almost 30 per cent of the population is foreign.
Even among the natives, the bride and groom will almost inevitably be clad
in extravagantly 'romantic' styles, some of which appear better suited to a
variety show stage than to a church aisle. The bridal basics are much as
elsewhere: white frock and veil.
But the devilry is in the detail. Expense is no object, and, in many cases,
nor is 'good taste'. The simplest dress is often laden with supernumerary
decorations. Any portion of the bodice or skirt - hipline, topside, backside
 -which can support a silken swag or a bundle of artificial pearls or
flowers is decorated accordingly.
The complete Barbie look may be achieved during a lengthy colouring and
contouring session in one of the city's hundreds of beauty parlours.
The groom, who elsewhere might be expected to shrink into a suit, the better
to enhance his partner's appearance, is more likely to dress to compete. A
shiny suit with a cut-off double-breasted jacket, winged collar, coloured
bow tie and black patent shoes would be extravagant enough.
But your man-about-to-wed will rarely stop there. As an extension of his
persona, his car will also come in for the treatment. My local florist has a
nice little seasonal earner in dressing up soft-tops. The car will emerge
with the cockpit completely ringed with appropriate blooms, and an
arrangement better suited to a dinner table strapped across the bonnet.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Fashion (The Global Wardrobe - At a Wedding): The bride

</HEADLINE>

The best thing about American weddings is that they can be held anywhere.
Forget boring old churches and town halls. In the States you can tie the
knot in museums, night clubs or back gardens, atop roof terraces, in
warehouse lofts or on beaches. This is not only a lot of fun, but for guests
it means you can be more adventurous when it comes to choosing what to wear.
That's the good news. The bad news, however, is that the traditional
white-wedding-with-frills has made a comeback across most of America, and on
many occasions guests are expected to turn up in traditional wedding gear.
For women, that means bright cocktail dresses in summer, or more
sophisticated evening wear for winter ceremonies. For men, it usually means
dark, bland suits with a white shirt and tie. Or, if it is a very formal
affair, tuxedos with white or black bow ties, this being one of the ugliest
of American traditions.
Fortunately, New Yorkers like to think of themselves as a different breed
from the rest of the country, so attending weddings in and around the
metropolis gives the guest a little more room to work with.
Women can wear sexier, funkier clothes - baggy men's suits remain popular
among the arty set - and in true New York style, female guests rarely bother
with the rule about not upstaging the bride.
Men, meanwhile, are allowed a dash of style or colour, whether it be in
their suits, shirts, ties or shoes, or in a combination of all four.
Waistcoats, or 'vests' as they are known here, are a particularly
fashionable way of expressing individualism at a wedding without upsetting
the bride's parents too much.
For the truly bizarre, however, nothing beats the recent wedding in a
Manhattan loft apartment. Because it was Halloween, surreal fancy dress was
the order of the day, with the lovely couple dressed as matching giant bugs.
The star of the show, however, was the female guest who turned up dressed as
 -guess what - a bride.

The wedding, part formal religious rite, part informal affectionate
celebration, can cause the guest as many headaches as it does the bride.
What to wear was once simply answered: one wore one's Sunday best with a new
hat and a corsage of symbolic flowers. Only the immediate wedding party
deemed the enterprise needful of new clothes and those, until this century,
tended to be practical, wear-again choices.
Over the years, the celebration or reception (once a simple wedding
breakfast for the family and immediate friends) has become longer and more
important than the ceremony, particularly a civil ceremony. At the same
time, the romantically archaic element has been highlighted.
It was once standard practice for men to wear the morning dress of a late
Victorian gentleman and for the women to choose gowns that had nothing to do
with current fashion but much to do with fairy tale illustrations and
Victorian Christmas cards.
Today, the level of formality of dress tends to be indicated on the
invitation with a curt instruction to the men. Women are left to
extrapolate. What is appropriate next to morning dress? What is suitable
adjacent to a tuxedo? What looks right on the arm of a lounge suit?
Possessors of wardrobes full of elegant, flattering clothing go
panic-shopping, opting in confusion for the brightest and most formal
daytime ensemble they can find on the rails - an unhappy compromise between
fancy dress and real life.
The results are obsessively, often shrilly, colour-coordinated, overly
trimmed and fussily detailed, frequently in fabrics inappropriate for the
weather - outfits, in fact, the like of which are seen at Royal Ascot and
nowhere else.
And just as at Ascot, the hats veer towards the fantastical: in the
millinery department they looked witty, jaunty, celebratory; en masse,
surrounded by their peers, they look strange, their wearers slightly
deranged.
Just as troublesome is the relaxed register office wedding for which no
particular form of dress is specified.
Usually the bride's mother has refused to miss her moment and has shrugged
into many matching layers of tulle and chiffon, while half the guests could
be on their way to Tesco. The other half have dressed for a job interview.
Everyone hits the champagne feeling anxiously under or over-dressed and the
pictures are an embarrassed mess.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: Let's hear it for older generations - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wines, like policemen, seem to be younger these days. But at least there are
more of the former, and at prices so temptingly cheap that 85 per cent of
bottles sold in the UK cost less than Pounds 3.50.
A wine costing Pounds 10 and above looks decidedly more expensive than it
did, even taking inflation into account. This raises the question: is it
worth buying wines that require time - sometimes a long time - to develop
their special qualities.
This question currently occupies the minds of growers, especially in France,
which produces some of the best wines but relies on a global market. Are
they worth their prices and time - Bordeaux's classed and peer growths, the
red and white grand and premier crus of burgundies, the richer Rhones and
Alsace.
The answer must be subjective, for such fine wines can no more be judged
objectively - on the basis of what the French call qualite prix and the
British value for money - than can a delicious but expensive restaurant meal
or the cost of fashionable clothes. It is mainly a matter of resources - and
how best to spend those available.
Yet, there is a strong case for acquiring fine wines. They have individual
characteristics, seductive bouquets and distinctive flavours, dry or sweet.
There is great variety, and they provide agreeable opportunities for
comparison that can transform a meal.
The cost range is wide, and it is not necessary to pay huge prices to enjoy
them. They call for companions to share them, discuss and even argue about
them. To open such wines on your own is a sad waste.
En primeur and 'futures' marketing has been suspended, at least temporarily,
particularly for clarets, and this is no bad thing. Partly because of
inflation and recession, but also because of misjudgment of a volatile
market, about the only recent claret vintage that could be re-sold
profitably - and that only with careful timing - was 1982.
But these upper-class wines must be bought early for keeping, including the
finer white burgundies and Moselles and Rhines. Times are past when top
growers and merchants could afford to hold stock over many years. Interest
rates are now too high, and capital available must be employed for the next
vintage to be bought.
There is a good case for buying such wines as soon as they are available in
bottle from your preferred retail merchant, which has made its own
selection, at various price levels. If possible, they should be marketed in
six-bottle lots as well as cases.
Of course, older vintages may be bought at auction; but although the
salerooms do their best to ensure the wines offered are in good condition,
you cannot always be sure. Moreover, the particular wines you want may not
be all that easy to come by - indeed, if German or Alsace, almost
impossible.
There are those who ask why, with modern techniques, development of these
fine wines cannot be speeded up. Do we have to wait up to 10 years before
opening a classed- growth claret, and not much less for a superior red
burgundy? The answers mostly are no and yes respectively. Most wines, even
the lesser varieties, are drunk too young. That goes for good champagne too.
One impediment to keeping wine over a period is lack of suitable domestic
accommodation. It should be held in dark, vibration-free conditions with
equable temperatures. Generally, the risk is heat rather than cold, which at
worst may slightly delay maturation. However, most private merchants, who
sell the kinds of wines discussed here, provide temperature-controlled
reserves, currently at a rent of about Pounds 4 to Pounds 5 a year,
including VAT. But, as Jancis Robinson pointed out in a recent article,
guaranteed individual identification must be assured.
Those who take special pleasure in drinking fine, probably at least
relatively expensive, wines - though quality does not always go with price -
may be accused of wine-snobbery. No doubt this exists, but for most
enthusiasts it is a collecting hobby, and one to be shared with others.
Wine drinking like this is an innocent pleasure. The best ratio of drinkers
per bottle, in my view, is four, and the maximum six, for enough should be
available for glasses to be refreshed. Often a wine may develop in the
glass.
Provided that there are no post-prandial car drivers present, such rationing
at a leisurely meal may allow three or four different wines, properly of
ascending quality and age, from the same region, to find their way on to the
table.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: Hey, hey listen to the band - Nicholas
Lander feeds on music during a short visit to Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 45-minute journey along the road east of Havana brings you to the
struggling oil wells that litter this coast. It also brings you to one of
the most enjoyable restaurants in Cuba.
It is called El C--a-el.
It is not a desire to conceal professional secrets which prevents me
revealing its full name. It is more simple than that: the missing letters
have fallen off and, like so much else in Cuba, cannot be replaced because
of lack of cash.
Business in these restaurants is not too good for the same reason. When we
lunched there one weekday, only one other table was occupied in a room that
could seat 70.
Nevertheless, a seven-piece Cuban band was warming up and they greeted us
with huge smiles and waves. The waitress, also delighted to see us, handed
over a large red menu, in Spanish and English, with about 30 items on it.
No sooner had we sat down and chosen our fare than the waitress said that,
unfortunately, there was no gas for the kitchen stoves and all the cooked
items were off. Would we like a sandwich instead? We had no option - even
though we already knew that the range of sandwiches on offer in Cuba is
limited to ham and cheese or cheese and ham.
The band comprised three guitars, a double bass, bongo drums, maracas,
andolave and a singer who announced 'traditional Cuban song' before each
number.
They played with all their heart and soul and within minutes I had forgotten
the unpleasant smell of oil from the wells on the shore, the cloudy weather
and that I was eating another ham and cheese sandwich. Suddenly, I started
enjoying the meal.
In Cuba live music is not just an integral part of every meal but also
almost the best value on any menu. We gave the band members Dollars 20
(Pounds 13.50) and they went away even happier. Our 12 sandwiches and beers
cost twice that. And however tough the sandwiches, they were certainly more
enjoyable than any meal in the restaurants of hotels such as the Nacional in
Havana or the Melia in Varadero, where so little respect is paid to Cuban
culinary tradition that you could close your eyes and imagine you were in
any hotel anywhere in the world.
Invariably, the two best items on offer are Cuban ice-cream and papaya. The
fruit has been crossed with the Spanish 'mamey', a tree that takes 17 years
to produce its first crop. It is deep red, slightly putrid, but wonderful.
An indication of how disappointing hotel restaurants are came last year
when, as the Cuban economy was being opened up to private enterprise, many
Cubans turned their houses into restaurants and began to entertain fellow
citizens and tourists to delicious home-cooked meals in return for US
dollars.
These enterprises, known as paladares, became instantly popular, with one
man reputedly clearing more than Dollars 1,000 a week. The hotels
retaliated, unfortunately not by raising standards, but by complaining to
the government which, sadly, closed larger premises.
Like so many other tourists, I went initially to La Bodeguita del Medio in
old Havana for a mojito, just one of the drinks Ernest Hemingway made famous
while living in a nearby hotel. The ingredients are ice, sugar, lime,
three-year-old white rum, mint leaves and soda water.
The restaurant behind the bar served Cuban food at tourist prices. The
traditional moros y cristianos (Moors and Christians - white rice and black
beans), roast pork and black bean soup was served along with the most
innovative dish, deep fried sweet potato. Dinner was Dollars 40 for two -
not including the music. At 9.30pm two guitarists swept in and sang as
though we were a room of impresarios.
For a final mojito in old Havana I went to sit on the terrace of El Patio
looking on to the faded grandeur of Havana's cathedral. The sky was blue,
the wind blowing in off the sea and, naturally, a four-piece band was
playing.
Until they heard the competition, that is. Across the small square another
band had set up and, with the aid of amplifiers, filled the square with
music. Discretion overcame pride and the four musicians I had noticed
earlier had put down their instruments and were standing in the audience.
Cuba may not thrill gastronomically, but it does provide the most exciting
music I have ever eaten to.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: Playing truant in Venice - Giles MacDonogh
receives magisterial tuition at the Gritti Palace hotel / Cookery Courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In my experience cookery schools fall into two categories: the magisterial
and the experimental. In the magisterial school you listen and take notes;
in the experimental you prepare dishes under the supervision of a chef.
To some extent the form the course takes appears to be dictated by the
dominant pedagogical ideas of the country in question; so it is that France
and Italy are magisterial because that is how their schools work, while in
northern Europe there is a tendency to let pupils discover things for
themselves.
The best courses combine the two systems. Personally I prefer more weight to
be given to the experimental side.
I also like the teaching to be based on instilling principles rather than
individual recipes. If a course succeeds only in teaching a clutch of
recipes it is a little like trying to learn a language from a phrase-book.
What a cook requires is a structural foundation which can be adapted to a
wider spectrum of uses.
The cookery school at the Gritti Palace hotel, in Venice, has been going for
the best part of two decades now. The courses take up five weeks of the
year, and each of these examines a particular theme: the Veneto region;
fresh herbs; Mediterranean cooking; autumnal cooking; and cooking for
special occasions.
The classes take place in the Gritti Palace, a former ducal residence which
has been the city's most luxurious hotel for a century or so.
The courses, taught by the Gritti's Friuli-born chef, Celestino Giacomello,
are in the purest magisterial school. A maximum of 20 pupils gather in front
of the chef and his assistant while he cooks. About half the pupils were
Italians, for the rest a simultaneous translation was given in American
English.
On my course last year all the pupils were serious, grown-up people with a
confirmed passion for food.
They included a German 'hobby cook'; a Hungarian woman married to an
American and living in Padua; a Japanese would-be pastry-chef; the wife of a
New York food broker; an elderly Russian aristocrat who lived nearby on the
Grand Canal; the above-mentioned Italians; and a clutch of Swedes, including
an eminent doctor-cum-biochemist whose insight into the biochemical and
nutritional aspects of what we were eating was a course in itself.
Our theme was herbs, or as our interpreter would say: 'urbs'.
In the course of the week we learned recipes involving chervil, wild celery,
citron (which is really a fruit), red and green chives, tarragon, oregano,
dill coriander (which Giacomello thought an aphrodisiac) rhubarb (the juice
of which was blended with parmigiano reggiano cheese to make a crust for
gnocchi) root and leaves of horseradish, majoram (Giacomello: the queen of
herbs), nettles (which the chef used to make a rich veloute, a world away
from the soup beloved of Irish peasants), mint, artichoke stems, hyssop,
melissa and fresh angelica leaves.
Every day for five days the chef prepared a three-course meal with a side
dish. This was served up as our lunch.
In the afternoon further courses examined the growing of herbs; table arts
and Venetian glass; flower arranging; and a tour of 'unknown' Venice.
I played truant after lunch, preferring to pound the marble pavements on my
own. It seemed to me that the afternoon classes would be better arranged at
6pm, when the lovely light had begun to fade.
I was disappointed that we did not have a chance to practise any of these
recipes. The one opportunity for audience participation came with the
forming of the potato gnocchi, for those who had been seduced by the,
frankly, American concept of the Mediterranean diet.
Giacomello's cooking used too much cream, butter and sugar. This worried me
less: only the poorest parts of Italy eat the Mediterranean diet, and only
the poorest people in them.
The rich citizens of Puglia cram as much butter, cream and sugar into their
gullets as they can.
I was sadder that the cooking was not sufficiently Venetian, but one of the
courses at least, does provide an introduction to the local food.
There was one important positive factor which should not be understated: the
chance to stay in an enchanting hotel in the most beautiful city in Europe.
The week long course at the Gritti Palace Hotel costs L600,000 (Pounds 240)
per person. Participants may stay in the hotel for five nights for L1.025m
per person for a double room, and L1.5m for a single. Tel: 010 39 41 79 46

FT  12 MAR 94 / Cookery: Cakes to bake for mother
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow is Mothering Sunday, and Easter and spring weddings are nearly upon
us. All are occasions for celebrating with sweetmeats and cakes.
Mothering Sunday used to be a day on which devout people made a pilgrimage
to their mother church. Later, it became the day to visit and honour your
birth mother. Either event may be marked by baking a simnel cake.
This is one of the richest cakes of the calendar year, especially when made
with lots of whole almonds blanched and pounded to a paste with eggs and
sugar, and perhaps a splash of saffron or orange flower water to flavour it.
A circular slab of this mixture (marchpane or marzipan) is sandwiched in the
middle of the cake. The rest is re-rolled and used to cloak the cake and to
stud the rim with a ring of little balls said to represent the apostles.
Wedding cakes are the richest and most elaborate of all, iced fancifully and
tiered like edible Albert memorials. The crumb of a wedding cake is dense
and dark, more fruit than flour, held fast by a double layer of wrapping:
marzipan first, then an outer casing of cement-hard icing.
These cakes seem designed to endure as long as marriage itself. They should
be robust enough to travel the length and breadth of Britain unharmed - even
when sliced and boxed and consigned into the hands of the post office.
My tastes - and baking ability - do not stretch that far. I incline towards
simpler, plainer offerings:
FENNEL SEED CAKE
Ingredients: 6oz unbleached white household flour; scant 1 teaspoon baking
powder; 2oz flaked almonds; 1 1/2 -2 teaspoons fennel seed, bruised with
pestle and mortar; the finely-grated zest of an orange; 6oz unsalted butter,
cut into dice; 4oz caster sugar; 2 size 3 eggs, broken up with a fork and
mixed with 2 tablespoons milk.
Method: Grind the almonds in a food processor or spice mill (the results
will taste much more almondy than ready-ground almonds sold in a packet).
Sift the flour twice with the baking powder, then stir in the citrus zest,
fennel and almonds.
Cream the butter and sugar in a food processor. Beat in the eggs gradually,
adding a little of the flour if there is any hint of curdling. Take the
mixture out of the machine and fold in the (rest of the) flour by hand.
Spoon the mixture into a 1 1/2 pt loaf tin that has been buttered, lined and
buttered again. Make a dip in the centre and bake at 350`F/180`C (gas mark
4) for 45 minutes, then at 335`F/170`C (gas mark 3 1/2 ) for 30 minutes.
Cover the tin with a sheet of greaseproof paper if the cake begins to brown
too much.
LIME  COCONUT MUFFINS (makes 6)
Ingredients: 1 1/2 oz dessicated coconut; the finely-grated zest of a lime;
1 tablespoon of freshly-squeezed lime juice; 1 heaped tablespoon of polenta
flour, plus enough unbleached white household flour to make 4oz in total; a
scant 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder; a pinch of salt; 1 1/2 oz caster sugar;
1 egg broken up with a fork and mixed with 3 fl oz milk; 1 1/2 oz butter.
Method: Sift together and mix the flours lightly, baking powder, salt and
sugar. Barely melt the butter. Away from the heat, quickly stir in the lime
juice, zest and coconut (in that order), followed by the beaten egg with
milk.
Tip the contents of the pan on to the dry ingredients and fold together
lightly. Spoon the mixture into six deep muffin tins lined with fluted paper
cases and bake for about 20 minutes at 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6).
Those who prefer to avoid baking of any sort may like to consider a
Mothering Sunday outing instead. This year, nearly two dozen National Trust
properties are opening specifically for the occasion and are offering
special Mother's Day lunches and/or teas. For details, ring 071-227 4802.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: FT winners - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, the computer at Transmedia's office selected at random the names
of 1,000 FT readers who had used their FT/Transmedia card during our
restaurant promotion and credited them each with Pounds 50. Letters are
going to all the lucky winners.
Transmedia has now advanced Pounds 1.3m to 270 restaurants in England,
Scotland and Wales. Since the card was launched in January, Transmedia has
passed on more than Pounds 100,000 in savings to FT readers.
The speed with which the card has taken off in the UK impressed even Mel
Chasen, Transmedia's founder, during a visit to London. What has impressed
is how quickly British restaurateurs have taken advantage of Transmedia's
cash resources to improve their facilities.
With Transmedia's assistance, restaurateurs have: financed extensions;
opened one new restaurant; bought espresso machines; taken delivery of
larger-than-usual wine orders to enjoy bigger discounts; paid for new
furniture; refurbished; and, in two cases, bought a water purification and
bottling system which turns tap water into the restaurant's own bottled
mineral water.
The star attraction in Christie's sale of fine wines on Thursday, which
realised more than Pounds 211,000, was dame jeanne of Chateau Petrus 1945.
Christie's, which had never before sold a dame jeanne, assumed the role of
Archimedes. By immersing the bottle in water, inside a sealed bag, it
established its volume as 3.87 litres, slightly more than five normal
bottles.
From a vintage considered by many to be the greatest of the century, the
bottle fetched Pounds 12,100, including buyer's premium, and went to a
European collector.
The sale was significant in that it came only a week after Hong Kong
announced an increase in excise tax on wine from 21 to 90 per cent.
For the past three years, Hong Kong buyers have dominated the fine wine
market for red bordeaux, particularly for the best vintages from 1961 to
1982. Unless the tax rise is modified, implications for the London wine
trade may be severe.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Murder most entertaining - Tragedy and trivia /
Manchester, City of Drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year, as you may have heard, Manchester is City of Drama - but why?
Certainly, 1994 is importing into Manchester a mass of high-profile national
and international theatre: Peter Brook's latest offering, Howard Barker's
new play (reviewed here by Paul Driver). Theatre de Complicite's staging of
The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol had its premiere here in January and the
Ninagawa Peer Gynt comes to Manchester next week. But what kind of a city of
drama will Manchester be in 1995?
The city's most high-profile theatre is the Royal Exchange. Its present
production is Venice Preserved, Otway's 1681 tragedy. One feature made my
visit worthwhile - the passionate sincerity with which wonderful young Helen
McCrory plays the heroine Belvidera. The play is full of such high-flown
emotionalism that I had imagined that only a grand, stylised form of acting
could bring it off; but McCrory's extraordinary naturalism has changed my
mind.
The rest of the staging - directed Gregory Hersov - is both phoney and
tepid. Jonathan Cullen, who plays Jaffeir, is a curious case. He has shown a
remarkable edge in several modern roles, but recently he has forsaken that,
concentrating on classic roles which he plays with a strange mix of
obviously faked intensity and wimpish sensitivity. To one line in ten he
brings simple eloquence; to the next nine an unconvincing striving for
'musical' effects and febrile contrivance. Meanwhile his accent keeps
wandering between Leeds and Oxford.
A certain actorliness may do very well for Venice Preserved, but George
Anton's Pierre (spoken with a Scots accent) is artificially conceived, and
spoken with a chilling display of vocal tricks. As for David Gant's Priuli,
I have not heard such a canting piece of hamming since - oh - Cheryl
Campbell's Lady Macbeth. And she at least was brisk, whereas he intones
every line like a requiem for a dead archbishop.
Hersov and his designer have set the play in Victorian dress, and the
leading characters in drab colours. Even McCrory, who looked so captivating
in the crinolines of Trelawny, is cramped here by stiff, dull, concealing
costumes. Still, she is the one lamp amid the gloom, a constant ray of vital
energy. And the sheer spontaneity with which she ascends the high climaxes
of delusion in her final speeches is astonishing.
'Intrigue and passion in a perfumed oasis]' Thus the subtitle to Deborah's
Daughter, a brand new play by Pam Gems being given in Manchester's smaller
Library Theatre. There is a lot of Gems about right now: Piaf back in the
West End, Queen Christina at the Bristol Old Vic, Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi
coming up at the Etcetera soon, and now this.
The action concerns a rich oil widow, Deborah Pedersen, her mother, Lady
Wiggins, and her teenage daughter Stephanie: all three in an unnamed Gulf
state, guests of Colonel Hassan Sa'id Ibn Said. Deborah - an important
research scientist until she married - has come to hand over a philanthropic
cheque for Dollars 20m to help the state through a drought. The Colonel,
however, may use it for military purposes. He manages at the same time (a)
to start to attempt seducing her (b) to launch a coup d'etat. Meanwhile he
may or may not be commencing an affair with her daughter. And . . . But do
you want to hear any more of this?
Deborah's Daughter is the most maladroit piece of playwriting I have seen in
a long while. Gems suspends both character consistency and the plot
regularly, simply to pursue cheap effects of suspense or surprise.
Half the time it is impossible to believe that Deborah is an intelligent
woman who takes responsibility for affairs, because she keeps dithering and
fretting hysterically; the other half she suddenly becomes cool and
self-possessed. This inner conflict might be interesting if Gems was
interested in making it so; but no, she just likes surprising us with
Deborah's changes of mind and tone.
Sue Dunderdale, directing, has tried to make the play more seamless than it
is. Anna Carteret does much to make the complex but nebulous Deborah come to
life, and it is good to see her playing so vulnerable a role. But she paces
her main speeches weakly, and overdoes the loud outbursts.
The role of Stephanie's boyfriend David is played by an appealingly
sensitive, willowy, young man (Philip Darling) when the words and action
make it plain he should be an insensitive, blundering, hunky young toff.
Jane Freeman over-coarsens the already indelicate Lady Wiggins. As Hassan,
Raad Rawi has to cope with lines like 'And your hair] The colour of pale
fire at night under the desert . . . '

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Hated Nightfall - Paul Driver enjoys Howard Barker's
'theatre of catastrophe' / Manchester, City of Drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dancehouse Theatre is Manchester's latest performance space, providing
this City of Drama with a much-needed middle-sized theatre.
To launch the Oxford Road venue, the Wrestling School company is giving the
premiere of Howard Barker's tough two-acter Hated Nightfall, under his own
direction. All Barker's plays are tough. His is a self-styled 'theatre of
catastrophe', in which the worst conceivable things tend to happen just
because they are conceivable; and blindings on stage in the King Lear manner
are routine.
Hated Nightfall has one - it comes nicely at the end to cap the four fatal
knifings we have witnessed, had our stomachs turned by, and also laughed at;
for though what we see is tragic it is also farce. The play's climate is the
permanent imminence of murder. If a character is not being butchered, he or
she is certainly being lethally threatened; but Barker has found the perfect
donnee for this kind of drama in the mysterious assassination of the
Romanoffs.
When the remains of the Tsar's family were exhumed, two unidentified bodies
were also found, and while Barker soberly conjectures that they were tutor
and maidservant to the Imperial household, his further conjectures about the
mind-set of the former are excitingly wild. Dancer is an all too willing
henchman of the Revolution charged with despatching his former employers and
charges, but possessed by a terrible spirit of historical irony. He does not
need the quasi-Greek conscience-chorus to remind him that he is only a
'transient phenomenon'. As brilliantly played by Ian McDiarmid, this
'Doorman of the Century' is leering, smug, vicious, unstaunchably
loquacious, and tormentedly looking for love.
Stepping ably with him in the dance of death are Nicholas Jones, a desperate
Emperor given to an impotent feyness of gesture; Anna Patrick, a superbly
haughty Empress; Jane Wood as a servant who cannot innocently bustle as she
would like to, since dead bodies strew her path; and Rebecca Charles, Nicola
Walker and sailor-suited Paul Gonshaw as the royal children. The last is a
silent role, but his ritual pouring of black fluid from a watering-can on
the occasion of each murder is peculiarly eloquent. It is a piece of
business worked up from a photograph of the young heir to the throne
wielding such a can.
Five great-coated Bolshevik ruffians including a lady, Claire Rushbrook's
Albeit, who delivers the coup de grace, complete the cast. Johan Engels's
set affords a pertinent contrast of traditional Russian birches and the
stark red telephone pole of the Future. Barker's direction is elegant and
sensible, unlikely though those terms might seem. It is surprising how much
of the complex nuance and poetic force of his text comes across. Yet there
is a sententiousness to his writing that irritates and a lack of resonance -
even at the big moments - reminding one that Barker is not a Bond or a
Beckett. Barker's reliance on the theme of open-eyed savagery can seem as
much an artificial convention as Jane Austen's 'two inches wide of ivory',
and a good deal more limiting.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Dame Kiri, the Housewife Diva - In celebratory mood,
Alastair Macaulay attends her 50th birthday concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kiri at 50] Those of us for whom Kiri has been a part of our lives for more
than 20 years are all gratitude. As she said to us at her Albert Hall gala
celebration the Albert Hall on Thursday, 'Tonight I've encountered nothing
but love.' Also: 'Fifty is nifty.' What a gal]
We give thanks for her voice, her charm, her frocks, and - not least - her
hairdos. We loved the Pounds 5 programme most for the umpteen photographs it
bore of her: Kiri ash-blonde, Kiri deep brunette, Kiri bouffante, Kiri with
ringlets . . . We know her voice has even more lights than her hair, but we
think it is a close-run thing. And as for the slice of Jane Asher and
Sainsbury's birthday cake that each of us received, well, Kiri, thanks a
million.
For us, so many memories . . . We recall Bernard Levin proclaiming that the
word Kiri would be found written on his heart (and she sang the Countess's
first aria from Figaro, the aria that helped to propel her into legend). We
are haunted by Kiri's dress for the 1981 royal wedding (Kit and the Widow
likened her to 'an illuminated opal fruit'). We cherished Kiri's rugby
anthem; and we could never forget the TV special she began by with 'Mi
chiamano Mimi - but you can call me Kiri.'
For Dame Kiri is famous not only for her voice but also - like Dame Edna -
for her niceness. Edna is Housewife Superstar; Kiri is Housewife Diva. Clive
James, who joined her onstage at the end of Thursday's celebration, was
there to represent all her admirers. 'Your voice is from heaven,' he told
her, 'and your feet are on the ground.' Yes, that's our Kiri.
Possibly Kiri gets her niceness from being a Maori. On Thursday, to remind
us of her roots, she brought the whole Waihirere Maori Group to Britain, to
sing and dance for her at the Albert Hall. Then, after joining them in two
Maori numbers, Kiri sang them 'Climb every mountain': after listening
awkwardly to which they promptly departed.
Now, what is nicest about Kiri's niceness is how carefully she directs it to
the maximum audience. Don't fret if you weren't there on Thursday, for it
will be on ITV, and Decca will shortly release it on CD, cassette, and
video. The most interesting thing about being there live, in fact, was to
compare the actual Kiri to the magnified projection of her on screen. It
proved impossible not to keep turning to the projection, because Kiri kept
addressing the camera. Those dark eyes are stunning, but they would hardly
have registered on us mere paying mortals in the Albert Hall had we not been
able to see them via the camera.
And the same goes for her voice. It is still wonderfully lustrous, only
slightly less well-nourished than of old, rich with so many different
lights, glowing from deep within. It has changed remarkably little since the
first time I heard it, 21 years ago, when she was the offstage Priestess in
Aida; I had never, I thought, heard anything more beautiful. The main thing
that has changed is the way she projects it. It used a voice that made you
positively glad to be in the higher recesses of Covent Garden, for you felt
its impact all the more amazedly far away up there.
These days, however, it doesn't beam out with that kind of address; and on
Thursday Kiri was mainly addressing the microphones. As the evening
progressed, and as she moved - via Rodgers and Hammerstein and Kurt Weill -
to Lloyd Webber, she sang with the aid of more and more amplification. In
terms of audience effect, this paid off. In the first half, the house had
received her pretty and careful accounts of items from the classic rep with
only the merest spattering of applause.
Later, however, Kiri the crossover artist, voice flooding through the
speakers, eyes so gorgeously twinkling into the camera, began to rouse the
audience into life. She even gave us 'With one look' from Sunset Boulevard.
(Just think what a nice Norma Desmond she'd make.) It had glamour, it was
voluptuous . . . and it was even more pre-packaged than Patti Lupone's.
True, Kiri would not be our Kiri were she not an icon of popular culture as
well as of opera. (She would be merely Te Kanawa.) Still, as I marvel again
at that voice, I wish, not that she would tackle less, just that she would
make more of it. But the chances are that Kiri will never know what it is to
be fully awake as an artist, spontaneous and intense. Happy to be the nice,
lovely, arranged, ordinary media personality she knows how to be so well,
she is a sleeping beauty of our day - charming, guarded, and dreamy.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Drawn to the alphabet - Patricia Morison admires the
letters in a very exclusive edition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken ten years and four more years of painstaking printing on iron
hand-presses, but the result is being hailed as a triumph. Ornamented Types
is a two-part limited edition of early 19th-century decorated alphabets
produced by Ian Mortimer of IM Primit of Hackney in London. Printed in a
limited edition of 200, copies of this masterly production of the printer's
art cost Pounds 1,650.
If that is beyond your means, for the next three weeks the alphabets can be
seen in the exhibition, Ornamented Types at St Bride Printing Library in
London.
St Bride Printing Library, owned by the Corporation of London, houses a
magnificent collection devoted to every aspect of the history and technology
of typefounding and printing. The Library has inherited the collection of 32
decorated alphabets, beautifully engraved letters on pieces of end-grain
boxwood. Apparently never used, they are extremely rare survivals.
Commercial type-foundries threw away quantities of old alphabets during the
decades when ornamented letters like these were rejected as 'Victorian'
rubbish. Only the Betjeman faction proclaimed its affection for the
fat-faced, slab-serif alphabets of the early 1800s. With their quaint
decorations, they were designed to appeal to a fairly unsophisticated public
and to stand out boldly on hand-bills, theatre-programmes, auction-notices
and stage-coaches.
The St Bride collection nearly perished when a wartime bomb destroyed the
premises of the Monotype Corporation, which bought them when the Caslon
foundry closed in 1936. However, James Mosley, librarian at St Bride,
succeeded in identifying the mysterious type as coming from the foundry of
L. J. Pouchee.
A little-known but intriguing figure, Pouchee was first a butcher and
coal-merchant. In the 1800s, he seems to have scented a killing to be made
in printing and set up a type-foundry. By paying printers more than
competitors offered, he succeeded in breaking their cartel. He also seems to
have invented the technique known as stereotype casting, in which wooden
original letters were 'dabbed' in hot metal and a cast was made.
Pouchee's ornamented alphabets show an exuberant vein of fantasy. Some are
laden with grapes, covered with swags of flowers, or made into naive
barnyard scenes with wooden-looking milkmaids and cows. Perhaps the most
splendid letters, several inches high, are covered in fashionable florists'
flowers; lilies, camellias, roses.
Most remarkable of all, however, is the Masonic Alphabet. Pouchee was a
freemason - indeed, the records of the Grand Lodge provided Mosley with much
of what he has succeeded in unearthing about Pouchee. Masonic dinners in the
1820s probably had menu-cards printed with his accurate evocation of 'the
Craft'. It is just one of the exhibition's intriguing glimpses of the
commercial and social world of Regency London, conjured up by Pouchee's
fantastical, fat, self-confident alphabets.
Exhibition until March 24 at St Bride Printing Library, Bride Lane, Fleet
Street, London; 071-353-4660.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Bolted together in totemic splendour - Anthony Caro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, within a day of each other, our be-knighted sculptors, Anthony
Caro and Eduardo Paolozzi, achieved their 70th birthdays, and I am delighted
to take this chance of wishing them well. But the temptation of pointing to
the differences between them should be resisted except in the most general
way.
Caro has two exhibitions current, and is the subject of this review;
Paolozzi hasn't, and isn't. Those two shows are distinct in themselves, yet
to take the one without the other is to miss a great deal, for they
complement each other to a remarkable degree. The one at Annely Juda is
beautifully chosen and succinct, setting the retrospective context; and the
one at Kenwood celebrates the latest and continuing creative engagement.
Taken together, the surprise they offer is the realisation that Caro is
rather less the unrepentant formalist and radical influence than we might
have supposed.
It remains true that through his association with the the American, David
Smith, in the years around 1960, he alone of his generation brought to
England, and indeed to Europe, a formal abstraction that was consciously
empty of human reference or association. Here were elements presented just
for themselves: cut, bolted and welded together in well-judged arrangements,
the space clear and open, the form self-evident, the human contact only that
which we have with physical objects in the everyday world.
The raw physical presence of these things as they appeared in the early
1960s, and the stringency of their presentation, were wonderfully new,
stimulating and refreshing. If it now seems somewhat ironic that it should
have been this phase in his work that shot Caro into international stardom,
the irony, as we may now see at Anneley Juda, lies only in the fact that
that phase was so short-lived. What we see so clearly is that Caro has been
working his way back to the figure, or at least to the anthropomorphic
inference of the figure, ever since.
The work of the 1950s, with which the Juda show begins, is directly
figurative, albeit the consciously simple and primitive figuration of such
earth-mother fetishes as the Willendorf Venus - Caro had but lately been
assistant to Henry Moore, a distinguished club that in it its time has
included Bernard Meadows and Phillip King. To move on to the Kenwood show is
to turn if not full circle, at least to spiral back close to the spirit of
those early years, and not just in the open reference to ancient gods and
heroes, but in formal terms.
Here in the Orangery at Kenwood, on their symbolic pedestals and thrones,
sit the totemic presences of Gods, Greeks and Trojans, and we are at once
back to the sculpture of the younger generation of the 1940s and '50s, to
the welded and symbolic totems of Reg Butler and, in particular, to the
precarious monoliths and stele of William Turnbull and, of course, the
fiercer presences of Eduardo Paolozzi. Caro, in propria persona, stands with
his peers once more.
He has lost none of his technical panache. He was ever a consummate
collagist in three dimensions, a bringer-together of disparate elements into
a lively and coherent order. To see these new modelled elements of
terracotta, which supply the symbolic character of the heroic protagonists,
set into or on their matrices of steel and wood, is to discover Caro happily
and unselfconsciously playing the same formal games that engaged him totally
30 years ago, but now subsumed within the narrative whole. The working of
the clay itself takes him back full 40 years, to the modelled figures of the
1950s.
The Homeric narrative is given by John Spurling in the excellent catalogue,
who takes us through the roster of the Olympian and Older Gods, charting
their allegiances and interventions in the affairs of the mortal heroes, the
Trojans and Achaians, and telling us again just who they were and what they
did - Achilles sulking in his tent, Hector un-nerved and doomed. Here they
all are, crammed together beneath Mount Ida, embattled, a wonderful sight.
The Trojan War Sculptures: Kenwood House, Hampstead Lane NW3, until April 6,
then to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in November. Anthony Caro - Sculpture
through Five Decades: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until May
7.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Inspired soloists - Record review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two superlative young violinists have their new concerto recordings on
simultaneous CD release. With Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus, the
ex-Siberian Maxim Vengerov - not yet 20 years old - plays the Mendelssohn
and the hoary old Bruch G minor (on Teldec 4509-90875-2). The American
Joshua Bell, some six years older, plays both of Prokofiev's concerti with
Dutoit and his Montreal orchestra (Decca 440 331-2), who throw in a terrific
Love of Three Oranges Suite for good measure.
Pointless to argue over which of these inspired soloists is the 'better';
better simply to enjoy their distinctive virtues. Vengerov - who struck me
three years ago as the greatest natural violinist I had ever heard, has also
been trained with the utmost seriousness in the 'traditional' repertoire,
Classic and Romantic. He plays dazzling encores, but in more substantial
pieces his phenomenal gifts are placed strictly at the service of the music.
Here, Vengerov's line in the Mendelssohn is at once coolly elegant and
wonderfully intense; his instrument seems capable of all the expressive
inflections of a human voice. For Max Bruch he goes into full-blooded
Romantic mode, just as required, and Masur treats the orchestral part with
enough stern dignity to disguise the fact that this is a fairly bland
period-piece. By contrast, Dutoit's responsibility in Bell's Prokofiev is to
realise as vividly as possible the bizarre colours of the scores, the better
to set off the wicked solo role.
He and his Montreal band (and the sound-engineers) do that to memorable
effect. Indeed, Dutoit and Bell find such richly suggestive depths in the
Second Concerto as to confound the received opinion that it is obviously the
lesser work. In the First Concerto Bell is equal to every virtuoso demand.
There is less devilry in his playing than in some famous performances, but
his uncanny sweetness of tone and utterance - pure, clean-cut, candidly felt
 -makes its own mark; and still in the 'grotesque' episodes he can turn
other-worldly or calculatedly gross in a twinkling.
After Anne Sophie von Otter's triumphant DG programme of Grieg songs last
year, we have another - overlapping Otter's, but very different - from the
young Finnish mezzo Monica Groop (BIS-CD-637), who was much admired at
Cardiff in the 1989 Singer of the Year contest. Von Otter's Grieg is
dramatically forceful (beautiful too, of course), in line with cosmopolitan
fashion since the later 1960s. Native Scandinavian audiences maintain a
soberer taste, as Elisabeth Soderstrom used to tell us.
They resent acting-out and insistent emphases, especially in plain strophic
songs - and even more in those by their national composers. Miss Groop is a
model Scandinavian singer: lovely, open tone, serene simplicity, clearly
attentive to words but never allowing them to bend or warp Grieg's
folk-rooted melodies.
Now a pair of follow-ups, in the cause of Nikolai Medtner (1880-1951) -
fellow-student of Rakhmaninov and Skryabin in Moscow, also a brilliant
pianist and ambitious (conservative, Brahmsian) composer, permanently
resident in Golders Green from 1935. Nikolai Demidenko has been reviving his
piano music with eclat, notably two of the three concerti (on Hyperion
CDA66580). For those who have been intrigued, there are two very grand works
to explore on Russian Disc RD CD 11 019: a sumptuous Piano Quintet in C, and
the huge Violin Sonata op. 44.
Evgeni Svetlanov is the sizzling pianist in both works, and the violinist
Alexander Labko and the great Borodin Quartet match him ('matched', rather:
the recordings date from 1968) in flair and commitment. And in EMI Classics'
'Composers in Person' series, Medtner can be heard delivering his own solo
pieces with scintillating authority, joining Moiseiwitsch in a rollicking
Round-dance, and accompanying Schwarzkopf and Slobodskaya in several sets of
his songs (CDC 7 54839 2, monaural): a fine, illuminating conspectus.
Devotees of the longevitous Catalan composer Federico Mompou (1893-1987)
find something magical in his stripped-down, faux-naf piano idiom, poised
somewhere between Satie and Jean Francaix. I was slightly disappointed to
find that the new Harmonia Mundi CD of his 'orchestral music' (HMC 901482)
offers mere orchestrations by other hands of two piano suites, Suburbis and
the Scenes d'enfants - in professional Impressionist style, attractive but
less striking than the severely black-and-white originals.
There are also, however, two quite unexpected discoveries: Los Improperios,
a noble ecclesiastical 'oratorio' that owes naked debts to Poulenc's Gloria
and Stabat Mater and yet sounds like purest Mompou, and a darkly limpid
song-set, Combat del somni. For those, Mompou at last ventured - in his 70s]
 -to do his own orchestrations, which have the stamp of lean, authentic
character.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Goodbye to all that . . . - Antony Thorncroft talks to
Lord Palumbo as he leaves his Arts Council post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of this month Lord Palumbo will remove the paintings from the
walls of his Great Peter Street penthouse, take one last look over the roof
tops at his unrivalled view of Westminster Abbey, and depart into the
obscurity from which Lady Thatcher plucked him just over five years ago to
be chairman of the Arts Council.
Peter Palumbo is modest, shy, reticent: not perhaps the obvious qualities
required to be the mouthpiece for the arts, the pressure point on the
government to secure the highest possible levels of subsidy. But Palumbo is
typically dogged in his assessment of his achievements. 'When I was selected
I was not even on the original list. No one wanted the job. But there were
plenty of candidates to be my successor.'
The succession was actually quite predictable. Former Arts Minister (and
Sotheby's chairman) Lord Gowrie takes on the role on April 1. 'He should
sail in calm waters', says Palumbo, well aware of the storms that have
lashed over him, especially in the time consuming, bureaucratic,
re-organisation of the council.
But if the operational hassles are in the past, with a compromise reached
between the strategic role of the council and grass roots devolution to the
Regional Arts Boards, Gowrie will still confront the key problem which made
Palumbo's last year so frustrating: a lack of government cash for the arts.
Unless he did a deal before taking on the job, Gowrie must soon tackle some
life and death crises at leading arts companies, in particular among the
nation's orchestras.
'I feel bitterly disappointed that we were not given a stand-still grant for
this year', says Palumbo. For four years he suffered the upheaval of
institutional change, with five successive ministers responsible for the
arts (including David Mellor twice) having a different view on structures;
from the out-and-out devolution of Tim Renton to the 'all power to me'
approach of Mellor.
But while this was exhausting, and kept Palumbo at the council five days a
week as against the odd afternoon put in by his predecessor Lord Rees-Mogg,
it was unimportant when compared with the increases in grant that Palumbo,
and his ministers, achieved. In real terms the council got a 12 per cent
uplift in subsidy in the four years until March 1994: this is Palumbo's
tangible contribution to the arts.
But from April, the council must make do with a 1.6 per cent cut, the first
in its history. Taken with the furore over his rationalisation plan for the
London orchestras, the reduction in grant has blighted Palumbo's last
months, and given an unfairly melancholic tinge to his stewardship. 'I am
not a resigner but I did think about it. The record of the arts in terms of
their cost effectiveness is such that they did not deserve to be cut.'
For months after last November's announcement Palumbo did not speak to Peter
Brooke, the secretary for National Heritage. They have now made up, but the
breach probably put paid to Palumbo's chance of taking a leading role in
seeing through his brightest idea, the Millennium Fund. He does not blame
Brooke for the reduction in grant. There were powerful forces in the
Treasury, like Michael Portillo, anxious to settle scores with David Mellor,
who had used his friendship with John Major to favour the arts. Whatever the
cause, Palumbo is genuinely distressed.
He is less upset about the mess over the orchestras, when his plan to form a
super-orchestra by merging the LPO and the Philharmonia floundered on press
criticism, the opposition of the musicians, and lack of confidence inside
the Council. He thinks that the future lies in backing fewer companies with
more cash, and that the orchestral issue will come back to haunt Gowrie.
The rows over money and the orchestras did not provoke his decision to
resign after just one term. He says he made that decision three months into
the job, when its time consuming nature became apparent.
As the inheritor of his father's property empire, Palumbo had never been
unduly stretched. He collected the rents and, as a devoted admirer of modern
architecture, dreamed of building a skyscraper designed by Mies van der Rohe
in the heart of the City of London. Prince Charles scotched that one.
So, when the unexpected call came from Margaret Thatcher, Palumbo threw
himself whole heartedly into the Arts Council. 'I've been out every night
for five years', he says. 'I've only seen my wife at the theatre, or a
concert, and not been able to talk to her until one in the morning. I have
three young children. I want to spend more time with them.' He also wants to
complete the development of his site at 1, The Poultry, although this time
with a building designed by Sir James Stirling - also roundly condemned by
Prince Charles.
Until the rows of the last year, Palumbo had built up some modest successes
at the council. 'I was told by a senior civil servant when I took on the job
that it was best to concentrate on three or four things, to do a little well
rather than a lot badly'. So he (naturally) started an architectural unit;
he launched Arts 2000, which encourages each year a different part of the
country to sponsor an arts form in the run up to the millennium; he backed
the Lottery when it became apparent that this was the only possible source
of funding for his millennium projects.
He had his disappointments, notably a pet project, the Arts Foundation,
which got off to a shaky start, and a much touted national strategy document
which was dismissed as trite. But in the main it was solid, unsensational,
progress. Palumbo acknowledged that ministers 'have the right to decide how
the arts are delivered to the consumer' - hence all the organisational
changes - 'but they do not have the right to tell us how to spend the
money.' By quiet diplomacy, supporting the government in public, Palumbo
kept the council independent and afloat. He feels the more let down by
ministers because he played their game.
Palumbo is not sanguine about the immediate future, but he is diplomatic.
'If Grey Gowrie can't get more money for the arts then nobody can'. He
thinks the Philistines are at the gates, and that the performing arts will
be the first to suffer. Peter Brooke may be a believer but there are forces
in the government with no appreciation of the arts or the urban landscape.
It will not be his problem. At 59 he leaves with very little baggage. His
best memories are the opening concert at the Birmingham Symphony Hall with
Rattle, the CBSO and Mahler - 'I was in tears the whole time' - and the
grass roots projects he so assiduously attended: a travelling actor and
electrician in Dorset, encouraging villagers to act out plays; a visual arts
bus visiting the Scottish islands. His main energies will now be devoted to
his first major property development, when he will quickly discover that,
despite five years as the cultural protector of the nation, he has done
little in persuading the public, at least in the City, to share his
enthusiasm for the new, the experimental, the challenging.

SOMETHING LOST BEHIND THE RANGES by John Blashford-Snell HarperCollins
Pounds 18, 374 pages
John Blashford-Snell is one of the last surviving 'explorers' in the
Victorians' understanding of the word. Supported in that tradition by the
Army, he was appointed 'Adventure Training Officer' in Sandhurst in 1963,
which seems to have allowed him to travel to the more obscure corners of the
world at the expense of the taxpayer; he also, it must be granted, did his
duty as a Sapper in various less interesting places like Belfast and
Whitehall.
This autobiography, Something Lost Behind The Ranges, is by no means
Blashford-Snell's first book and it is a surprisingly good read so long as
you are not looking for philosophical insights or deep political analysis
(Haile Selassie is 'one of the most supreme Christian warrior kings the
world had ever known'). What he gives us instead of profundity is a brisk
record of a crowded, dangerous and adventurous life.
After childhood in a Hereford rectory, school in Jersey, and a subaltern's
blooding in Cyprus, Blashford-Snell went off to Ethiopia on 'the expedition
that changed my life' - to attempt to navigate the Blue Nile by raft. He and
his multi-disciplinary team had not reckoned with the bandits and rapids
that awaited them, but they made it, and it made his name.
There followed the founding of the Scientific Exploration Society and 20
years of fun: South America (the Alaska-Cape Horn venture, with the horrors
of the Darien Gap), Oman, Zaire (a scientific route to commemorate the
centenary of Stanley's trans-Africa expedition), Papua New Guinea, East
Africa, Loch Ness, Tibet, Mongolia - and so much and so many miles more.
Blashford-Snell's own role, he explains in a rather endearingly inarticulate
way: 'I am not a scientist but simply, as a Royal Engineer, an
'obstacle-breaker' whose job it was to launch and sustain the experts in
their selected areas to the best of my ability'.
The job got more serious when the adventure-training of young soldiers was
diverted to a larger role by a British government alarmed by the arrival of
a new generation of unemployed. Prince Charles told the Lords that the young
were seeking 'some of the challenges of war in a peacetime situation': HRH
thereafter became one of Blashford-Snell's most important patrons.
The immediate result was Operation Drake in 1978, which sent a a sailing
ship round the world on a variety of good deeds, crewed by 'Young Explorers'
who had been selected by old-fashioned criteria ('We had to get candidates
wet, cold, hungry, miserable, frightened and furious as fast as possible,' -
Blashford-Snell was surprised to find that girls qualified faster than men).
That led to Operation Raleigh, on a larger scale, and eventually in the
late-1980s to a number of 'Executive Expeditions' in which older FT-types
went out to places like Botswana and Nepal to endure the sort of experiences
they were endorsing for the younger generation.
He can be surprisingly funny, particularly about his childhood: he writes of
his pet monkey who seized control of the household Maxim gun; the St Bernard
who devoured the pekingese which cocked a leg over the war memorial; the
ringing of his father's church bell by peppering it with a .300 rifle. The
tone of voice is, shall we say, Sandhurst ('my chums'; 'my jolly, supportive
wife'). There is next to no description of a personal life, and no detail
about the eventual troubles of Operation Raleigh, or, for that matter, the
organising of these formidable expeditions.
This is the very opposite of the life of an actuary or an academic and
Blashford-Snell tells it with gusto.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Books: Charlotte as a fierce survivor - A new biography of
the first feminist novelist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLOTTE BRONTE: A PASSIONATE LIFE by Lyndall Gordon Chatto  Windus Pounds
15.99, 403 pages
In 1837, a shy, hopeful vicar's daughter called Charlotte Bronte sent some
of her writings to Robert Southey, the Poet Laureate. 'Madam', came back the
devastating reply 'literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and
it ought not to be.'
Ten years later, Charlotte answered Southey with Jane Eyre, the first voice
in English fiction of an angry, passionate woman struggling to maintain
independence of spirit and intellect. It was a revolutionary work and a
scandalous bestseller. 'Worth 50 Trollopes and Martineaus, with 50 Dickenses
and Bulwers to keep them company; but rather a brazen Miss,' wrote one male
critic.
Was Charlotte Bronte a brazen miss? She has always been seen as the waif of
literary history - a legend started by Mrs Gaskell, whose first Life of
Charlotte as a timid genius destroyed by hardship and suffering, influenced
all subsequent Bronte scholarship.
In this triumphant new biography, Lyndall Gordon turns the tables. Here
Charlotte is a fierce survivor who, in life and in art, turned loss to gain,
and found unexpected happiness. Outwardly she shrank and cringed, but the
clues to the fire and rage of Jane Eyre and Villette, says Gordon, lie in
'that unseen space in which gifted women of Charlotte's time were forced to
live.' Sensitive, open-minded, vivid, full of psychological insight, her
book is a brilliant reappraisal of Charlotte Bronte's life, work and the
flow between the two.
Born in 1816, Charlotte was motherless by the age of five and packed off to
a grim charity boarding school at eight. One of her early memories was
watching her sister Maria die, of starvation and physical abuse at the hands
of a sadistic teacher - recreated as the terrifying Miss Scatchard in Jane
Eyre. The experience was seminal for all the Brontes, pushing Emily toward
unworldliness and submission, Charlotte to rebellion.
As governesses to the idle rich, the Bronte girls continued to be
ill-treated and under-stimulated. Liberation came with an invitation from a
school friend to learn French in Brussels - the romantic city of Villette.
At 26, Charlotte fell in love with Monsieur Heger, her flamboyant professeur
of rhetoric] 'His mind was my library, and whenever it was opened to me, I
entered bliss.'
Sex flooded into the classroom. He puffed cigar smoke into her desk to let
her know he had left a gift. In her French essays, she responded with a
torrent of ambition and desire, announcing 'I believe I have genius.' Heger
retreated, and soon an outraged Madame Heger escorted her to the Ostend boat
and restricted letters to two a year. Back at her father's bleak parsonage,
polite schoolgirl missives alternated with wild outpourings - 'I love French
for your sake with my heart and soul.'
In this desperate encounter, argues Gordon, Charlotte found her own voice,
then transformed it into the pressingly truthful public speech of Jane Eyre,
where Jane talks to Rochester not 'through the medium of custom,
conventionalities, nor even mortal flesh - it is my spirit that addresses
your spirit . . . equal - as we are.' Feminist critics have read this as
gender antagonism, with Rochester blinded and emasculated at the end.
Gordon, relating the book to its origins in Charlotte's life, sees her as 'a
speaker for the soul as well as for women.'
Lionised over Jane Eyre, Charlotte refused to roar. In London she seemed
provincial and gauche - when Thackeray gave a party in her honour she
snubbed his society friends, huddled in the corner with the governess, and
Thackeray fled to his club.
A flirtatious friendship with her publisher, George Smith, also became
fraught. Smith was the model for charming Graham Bretton in Villette (1854),
but when Charlotte realised his shallowness, she wrote him out of the third
volume in favour of a Belgian teacher based on Heger. She always spoke most
eloquently to men on paper. Smith got the message - and underpaid her for
the book.
Villette, with its icy heroine Lucy Snowe, is the tale of a woman's rise
from frozen passivity to eloquence - Charlotte's own Brussels story. But in
life, there was a twist. By the time Villette finished, all Charlotte's
siblings had died of consumption and she was alone. At the height of her
creative powers, she married her father's curate, who she had always
despised as her intellectual inferior. He was loyal, kind but disapproved of
her writing; she abandoned it.
Perfection of the life, or of the work? asked Yeats. It was a sober but
valid choice. She swapped art for happiness, and when she died in pregnancy,
aged 38, 'Charlotte was the only Bronte to die with human love on her lips.'
Gordon explores her life in both a Victorian and contemporary context. She
contrasts Charlotte's approach with that of men about town like Dickens and
Thackeray, who had instant access to 'the Condition of England'. She places
her in a tradition of radical women writers - Emily Dickinson, Woolf, Plath
 -for whom periods of madness and depression were part of the creative
process. As literary and social history, this is a far-reaching, erudite
study. It is also a deeply-moving story.

MODERN PHILOSOPHY by Roger Scruton Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 611 pages
Philosophy is the attempt to clarify, and if possible to answer, questions
about reality, knowledge, reason, truth and value. It is a highly
consequential enterprise; it gave birth to the natural sciences, among them
physics and biology, and the social sciences, among them sociology and
psychology. It is the wellspring of enquiry, and the forum for discussion of
all the ultimate questions; but it is also an intellectual hospice for our
currently unsolvable problems, whether of practice or theory.
Isaiah Berlin once remarked that the philosopher in his study can change the
course of history within a generation. He had in mind Locke and Rousseau,
whose writings are quoted verbatim in the documents of the American and
French revolutions, and Marx, whose shadow lies long across our age. But he
might easily have mentioned many other philosophers whose ideas have shaped
science, art, and all other spheres of human endeavour, both for good and
ill.
Roger Scruton's aim is to introduce us to modern philosophy thus conceived.
He accordingly explains the nature and purpose of discussion in all its main
areas: the theory of knowledge, logic, metaphysics, ethics, the philosophy
of language, and much besides, starting from Rene Descartes in the 17th
century and bringing us up to date with contemporary debates. Scruton is a
masterly writer; his book is a paradigm of lucidity, written with a crisp
elegance that proves, by example, the justice of his attack on the jargon
and obscurantism which infects much present-day philosophy and prevents its
wider appreciation.
A study of philosophy, Scruton says, is a study of arguments and ideas. The
questions that generate them have a particular character: they are abstract,
in that they concern the most general kinds or categories of things, and
they are ultimate, in that they concern the fundamental reasons and causes
of things. For example: the question, 'Why did she fall?' relates to a
particular concrete event. 'Why do things fall?', although more general, is
still a scientific, not a philosophical, question. 'What kind of thing is a
fall?' - inviting the answer, 'an event', and therefore a discussion of
whether events are basic constituents of the universe - is an entirely
general question, and shows what kind of understanding philosophy seeks.
The ultimacy point arises from our need for explanations. If B is the
explanation for A, and if B is in turn explained by C, we will hope that
there is some terminus D or even Z which gives the final explanation for A,
because if the chain of reasons or causes continues ad infinitum we will
have no explanation for A after all. Can the ultimate grounds of anything -
even of the world as a whole - be discovered? Philosophy tries to find out.
Another defining feature of philosophy is its quest for truth. Not all human
endeavour aims at truth; some aims at convenience, some at persuasion, some
trades in fictions. But philosophy is the endeavour to find out how things
really are. The sciences try to do this in their own particular spheres; but
philosophy attempts the overview, in the hope of devising a framework for
understanding ourselves and the world.
Scruton systematically tackles the abstract and ultimate questions which
have most exercised philosophers from the 17th century until now. His
discussion is based on introductory lectures delivered at Birkbeck College
in the University of London, and is therefore aimed at beginners. The result
is bracing, entertaining and informative. Anyone wishing to learn about
philosophy will find it an excellent place to start.
There are, however, caveats. Scruton is notorious for holding disagreeable
right-wing views, which would not matter if he could stop himself making
irrelevant allusions to them, with neither explanation nor justification.
But he cannot so resist. For example, in the middle of describing Logical
Positivism's 'verification' theory he suddenly and without further
discussion remarks that it is 'part of the 'culture of repudiation' whereby
central Europe threw away its inheritance and committed moral suicide.' No
opportunity for a dig at the Left or Modernism is missed; and although the
result is often enough amusing, it also injects too polemical and unargued a
note into what is meant to be an introduction to the enterprise of reason
itself, for which dispassion is an ideal.
There are also odd mistakes. Bishop Berkeley did not deny the existence of
the physical world, as Scruton claims, thereby perpetuating an old
misunderstanding; nor is empiricism a 'metaphysical' theory, that is, a
theory about reality; it is an epistemological theory, that is, a theory
about the nature and sources of knowledge. But when Scruton is not grinding
axes or hurrying too fast, he is a highly readable guide. Especially
praiseworthy are his chapters on aesthetics and ethics, and his robust
criticism of aspects of contemporary French thought. Scruton sees philosophy
as an integral part of general education; caveats aside, his book
marvellously shows why that is right.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Books: Life and times of a paper tiger - The self-appointed
voice of Britain's Jewish community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD KAUFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JEWISH CHRONICLE AND ANGLO-JEWRY, 1841-1991 by David Cesarani Cambridge
University Press Pounds 40, 329 pages
Two Jews stood before a firing squad. Said one, 'I'm going to ask for a
blindfold.' Retorted the other, 'Don't cause trouble.'
For most of its 150 years as the self-appointed voice of Britain's Jewish
community, the Jewish Chronicle has been trying not to cause trouble.
Occasionally the newspaper has been led by men, either wayward or brilliant,
who have failed to base their editorial policies on a groping search for the
lowest common denominator. In 1927 Leopold Greenberg, ignoring the timorous
bleatings of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, campaigned -
successfully - on behalf of Oscar Slater, a Jew wrongfully convicted of
murder. In the 1930s Jack Rich, again shaking off restraint from the Board
of Deputies, advocated boycotting German goods after the Nazis came to power
and supported opposition to fascist marches in the streets of London's East
End.
In 1946 Ivan Greenberg was sacked for supporting the terrorist gangs running
amok in British-occupied Palestine; the Jewish Chronicle's directors drew
the line at his hailing various atrocities as 'Jewish Resistance
Operations.' A very different kind of editor - perhaps its best ever - was
William Frankel, who wrote in 1974: 'It is today beyond doubt that the
Palestinians have developed a real sense of identity. They form an intrinsic
part of the jigsaw puzzle of Middle East politics and they cannot be ignored
or wished into silence.'
Mostly, however, the newspaper's editors have accepted the dictum which is
attributed by David Cesarani in this book to Frankel's successor, Geoffrey
Paul, that: 'a newspaper, at least one like the Jewish Chronicle, could not
run ahead of its readership, crusading for one particular cause which they
did not share.' Paul banned his reporters from interviewing representatives
of the Palestine Liberation Organisation on the grounds that: 'a majority of
our readers would misinterpret our intentions.'
That approach would have found favour with the Jewish Chronicle's directors
who, in announcing the dismissal of Ivan Greenberg, laid down the 'main
lines' of the paper's policy as 'Moderate Zionist in respect to
Palestine/Orthodox as regards the Jewish religion/Strictly loyal in relation
to HMG.'
At times the paper's Zionism was so moderate as to be almost indiscernible.
When Theodore Herzl announced the convening of a congress to found the
Zionist Organisation, the Chronicle wailed that 'the very notion of an
'International Congress' was an insult to the patriotism of Jews' and liable
to give rise to 'groundless insinuations that Jews are now confessedly
unpatriotic.'
Strict loyalty to HMG was at delicate moments interpreted so assiduously as
to make cringing seem positively daring. The most venomous anti-Semites,
when advocating anti-Jewish immigration legislation at the beginning of this
century, could not have outdone the Jewish Chronicle's categorisation of
wretched newcomers from Eastern Europe as 'the mediaevalised overflow of the
Russia and Romanian Ghettos', its jocularly expressed bafflement as to 'why
these magnetic Poles are attracted to our shores', and its advocacy of
repatriation, based on the belief that 'men such as these should be returned
to their native places.'
Such views were supported by letters from readers, which expressed fear of
'competition from lowly paid foreign Jews.' It is indeed the comfortably-off
who have generally been most at home with the paper. The upwardly-striving
were guided by property advertisements in its columns to move house to those
posh neighbourhoods of Golders Green, Edgware and their like which were the
preferred locations for what Cesarani calls the 'galloping suburbanisation'
of London Jewry.
Although in 1938 the Chronicle expressed the view that in order that
ostentatious affluence should not provoke anti-Semitism - 'It might be a
good or a bad thing if Jews were to ration, if they could, their
representation in the professions' - by 1985 readership surveys (says
Cesarani) 'showed that 48 per cent of JC readers were in social classes A
and B, although only 17 per cent of the total British adult population
normally fell into these categories . . . The terminal age of education was
'considerably higher' than the national average, and the percentage of home
ownership, at 87 per cent, was 'far in excess' of nationwide trends.'
No wonder that, when the paper did poke its head above the parapet to bemoan
anti-Semitism, its particular concerns included exclusion of Jews from
certain golf clubs and quotas against Jews seeking admission to public
schools.
In this admirably researched, if somewhat gracelessly written, volume,
Cesarani points out that its 'readership profile makes the Jewish Chronicle
a highly attractive medium' for advertisers; indeed, each week the paper's
pages demonstrate anew that this successful and long-lived publication
faithfully reflects that minority of the Jewish community who buy it, in
being prosperous, conformist and complacent.

MARBLE SKIN by Slavenka Draculic The Women's Press Pounds 5.99, 188 pages
THE GREAT UMBILICAL: MOTHER, DAUGHTER, MOTHER, THE UNBREAKABLE BOND by
Rachel Billington Hutchinson Pounds 17.99, 238 pages
DEAR MOTHER . . .WOMEN WRITING TO OR ABOUT THEIR MOTHERS edited by Marijke
Woolsey and Susan King The Women's Press Pounds 6.99, 173 pages
Just in time for Mothering Sunday, when the recipes for Simnel cake and the
tiny purple non-books of verse come into bloom, these three volumes offer a
rich selection of mother and daughter experiences. Both the Billington and
the Women's Press anthologies yield food for thought, while Slavenka
Draculic's novel Marble Skin comes labelled 'Unsuitable Gift For Mother'.
Draculic is a Croatian novelist and journalist, a co-founder in 1979 of the
first feminist group in Yugoslavia, and the author of the non-fiction How We
Survived Communism and Even Laughed. There are no laughs in Marble Skin, an
intense and claustrophobic narration of a daughter's survival of life with
mother. Soon after the story opens - 'I thought I had already forgiven my
mother for everything' - the daughter, now grown-up and a sculptor, makes a
nude statue and exhibits it under the title 'My Mother's Body'. When
visitors to the show, challenged by the sculpture's sensuality, leave dirty
fingermarks on mother's skin, the daughter feels nauseous but also, 'a
strange excitement gripped me at the thought of all these people doing what
I had never been able to do, at the thought of the forbidden gesture.'
Mother sees a photograph of the reclining nude in a newspaper and attempts,
not for the first time, suicide. Why is the daughter so obsessed with her
mother's body, and what has the unhappy woman done to inspire such revenge?
Mother, in flashback, is a beautiful and deeply sensuous young widow. Not
unnaturally, she attempts to conceal her private life but the child, plagued
by her mother's silence on matters physical, grows into something of a
Peeping Tom. Mother is also fanatical about cleanliness, and when a rare
guest spills wine on her white tablecloth the incident inevitably predicts
trouble at menarche. She remarries and before long the stepfather is
visiting the girl's bedroom and she shatters the veneer of their lives by
telling her mother that he has raped her. Mother sends her away for years
and not until she is old, broken and alone can her daughter forgive her.
Draculic's telling of her bleak, inverted Oedipal tale is masterly, her
prose by turns spare and sensual, but her narrator's stony egotism chills.
In The Great Umbilical Rachel Billington traces the progress of an imaginary
little girl from babyhood to grandmotherhood, with many reflective stops
along the way. The author's views that the influence of the female line is
stronger than that of father to son, and that there is an unbreakable bond
between mother and daughter that is a positive force for good in society,
will neither shock nor challenge, but her enthusiasm is another nail in the
coffin of the 'blame mother for everything' movement so fashionable a few
years ago. This is a book to dip into, packed with mini-case histories and
opinions which will infuriate and intrigue.
Dear Mother . . . which has its share of embarrassments and duds, contains
three or four outstanding pieces and several of interest, as well as
familiar but none-the-worse-for-that extracts from Virginia Woolf, Maya
Angelou and Alice Walker. In An Indian Woman Speaks, the anonymous narrator
tells the immensely cheering tale of a mother travelling to England to
rescue her daughter from a hideous arranged marriage, and Catherine Cookson
 -good to see her up there with the serious sisters - writes compassionately
about her own poor dissolute mother.
The collection's gem, however, is taken from May Sarton's A Wild Green
Place. This has a dual mother/daughter theme as it evokes marvellously a
period in Sarton's mother's childhood when she was sent to stay with an old
Welsh woman and her disturbed and violent daughter. Astonishingly, Judith
Arcana who introduces the anthology says of this strange and moving story
only that it 'shows us the desperate importance of knowing our mothers in
terms of their own lives before we were their daughters, before they were
anyone's mothers.' It does, but it shows us much more, as do the best
ingredients of this celebration of mothers and daughters.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Gardening: And Squirrel Nutkin got the blame . . . - . . .
unjustifiably, says Robin Lane Fox, who is worried about his yew hedge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedging has been blamed for a lot recently, but I do not feel the blame has
gone far enough. In 1989, I made an investment; now, I have lost the lot. It
has cost me Pounds 600 and five years of my time.
In 1989, I planted two long yew hedges. The yews came through a Yorkshire
king of garden-centre stocking who sourced them, as he put it, in Belgium.
They arrived - strong, bushy and far from cheap. They went in 2ft apart in a
staggered line.
A year earlier, however, I had begun with another line of smaller and
cheaper yews, bought in transit from Gloucestershire's Batsford Garden
Centre in the gardens of Batsford Park. The manager did warn me that these
yews were small and had just arrived from Cornwall. So, having a few Belgian
spares, I used these in 1989 to thicken up the 1988 line.
During the summer, one of the 1988 intake turned bronze, not green, and I
blamed the drought and academic pressure on the hosing schedule. In 1990,
eight more of the Batsford batch turned bronze, too. Perhaps they had been
dry, I thought, and the drought was taking a year to show the effect. They
were not dead, though, and they were showing some green shoots.
In 1991, however, they were bronze all over. This started to bother their
big Belgian brothers; by 1992, most of this hedge was burnished to a height
of 2ft. And the trouble was spreading at a T-junction where a second Belgian
hedge began, previously unscathed and bushing healthily.
In January 1993, I consulted the experts at the Hillier Arboretum. Burn the
lot, they told me, with cheerful confidence. First, though, pack up a rooted
specimen and send it to a laboratory. I returned from Hillier and
compromised. I took out the totally-tanned yews and substituted my next-best
evergreen, osmarea. Belgian buttresses remained, only slightly browned and
set thickly with leaves.
The osmarea grew throughout the summer but the Belgian buttresses turned
bronze. At the T-junction, the upper growths of their brothers began to look
twisty and thinly-needled. I have an eye for sickness, and it told me they
were ill.
I have watched them throughout the winter. No-one now can complain of
drought, except for a water authority, and my Cotswold soil drains quickly;
it is not waterlogged. But nothing has improved and I have just removed the
last of the 1988-89 intake. I have lost Pounds 500 of yew and Pounds 100 of
labour and preparation. When we dug up the plants, they were not rooted very
widely - but there were no visible scars or infections.
This week, I have consulted more experts, beginning at the Royal
Horticultural Society's Wisley headquarters where Pippa Greenwood, in plant
pathology, is celebrating her promising debut on the BBC's Gardeners'
Question Time.
At Hillier, the experts mentioned phytophthora: could they have been right?
Unlikely, Greenwood told me, because the RHS had been pestered by the public
with just this problem since 1990; and, although it had tested clinically,
traces of phytophthora turn up only seldomly. Anyway, if you have it, bark,
branches and leaves turn brown, not bronze.
Then what? I asked her. The answer, she suggested, was cultivation. The yews
might have been planted badly - too dry, or perhaps too wet, or possibly
both. Probably they were put in too deep, so the roots could not find
oxygen. She said she saw this problem often on yews sent in by members of
the RHS.
I protest. I have been taught how to garden. I am actually rather good at
it. You would never catch me planting yews too deeply.
Please do not take it personally, she reassured me: the RHS met lots of
people who were obviously very good gardeners but still could make trifling
 -and common - mistakes.
What about the National Trust? I asked. Did it not have a problem with old
yew hedges which were showing brown patches halfway up? Yes, she agreed, but
it could well be rodents: it was amazing how squirrels, for instance, could
climb up a hedge and ring its bark at quite a height. Greenwood will see
that diseased specimens are examined if sent to Wisley by members of the
RHS.
On Greenwood's advice, I then rang the Forestry Commission's David Rose, at
Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, Farnham, Surrey GU10 4LH. While the
commission usually contracts its knowledge for a fee, Rose will be willing
to consider investigating yew trees if enough readers write in with evidence
of a similar problem.
First, he absolved the National Trust rodent. At Buckland Abbey, the trust
lost an old yew hedge and some younger plantings of yew, but the cause was
diagnosed as phytophthora which is, in Rose's view, 'by far the commonest
cause of death in yew'.
This, of course, does not suit my problem: I have bronzing, not browning,
and my plants are not actually dead. So, Rose asked, what about the
cultivation? Too wet, too dry, too deep? Or might it be the climate: cold
winds (and they are cold in the Cotswolds) or sudden frost?
Ask an expert and you almost believe him. But wait. The bronzing began on
only one plant and spread first to only one batch. It took six years  - yet,
all the yews face the same wind, the same drought and the same old Adam in
the gardener. How can they be the cause?
At this point, I think I trust my common sense. I believe that Batsford gave
the disease to Belgium and the others are fighting infection. And I think I
know where it came from: across the Channel. It infiltrated Cornwall on
imported Eurostock and spread to London with people who buy plants in
transit to sell them.
Before you plant a yew hedge, be clear that the stock is clean, its source
reputable and do not plant it too deep. Meanwhile, if you know of trouble,
write to Rose and give details. Something other than phytophthora is abroad
and I refuse to believe that the culprit is Squirrel Nutkin.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Equestrianism: Enter the aristocrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven aristocratic visitors from the east are currently stretching their
legs in the green shoots of the Russian Horse Society's paddocks at Epsom,
in Surrey.
Four stallions and three mares of the rare Caspian breed of horse arrived in
the UK on February 22 at the end of a journey which took them by truck from
Tehran, through Azerbaijan and Georgia, across the Caucasus mountains, and
through the Ukraine to Brest in Belarus, where they were quarantined before
continuing to England.
Their arrival is a milestone in the history of the breed.
The Caspian, believed extinct, was rediscovered almost 30 years ago by
Louise Firouz, an American married and settled in Iran. It was first
imported to Britain in the early 1970s.
Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was given a stallion and a mare by
Firouz, forming part of the UK's foundation stock for these stylish horses,
acknowledged now to be one of the oldest breeds in the world and a
forerunner of the Arab.
Approximately 19 horses were imported from 1971 until the revolution in 1977
stopped exports and dispersed existing stocks in Iran.
Their discovery has a fairy-tale ring. Firouz had been searching for mounts
for younger pupils at her riding school and discovered a small bay stallion,
perfectly proportioned, in a village on the shores of the Caspian sea.
Further sorties uncovered more horses, their diminutive, fine-boned bodies
contrasting sharply with the heavier, coarser Mongolian and Turkoman horses
of the area.
The Caspians proved perfect school horses, popular with parents and pupils,
encouraging Firouz to research and foster the breed. By the late 1970s she
held a herd of 200 horses, only to be dispersed and almost lost in the
revolution.
The second revival of the breed in Iran owes much to the chance discovery of
a handful of Caspians in a barn of more than 1,000 horses being sold off by
the Revolutionary Guard in 1989.
The Caspian stands between 10.3 and 12.3 hands, with an Arab-type head,
slender limbs and fine, silky coat.
They are intelligent gentle, move with elegance and panache and are equally
at home under saddle, in harness or on lead-rein.
Their disposition makes them ideal children's mounts, particularly fond of
jumping, but they are also extremely successful as driving horses, proving
themselves genuine all-rounders that the whole family can enjoy.
The UK has approximately 260 registered Caspians, spread throughout six
large studs and numerous smaller operations. There are also studs in
Australasia and the US.
Two of the new arrivals are currently in quarantine in Epsom before going to
the US to augment the bloodlines of foundation stock.
Meanwhile, their companions can breathe easy and deep in the security of the
English countryside, a far cry from a rolling truckride across Russia.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Motoring: Is the revolution here? - Stuart Marshall detects
changes in car design which may presage major upheavals / Geneva motor show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, most cars were three-box (bonnet, body and boot) saloons. Then
came the two-box hatchback (bonnet and body with integral load space). And
now it looks as if it will be the turn of the one-box car. The first signs
of what could be a major upheaval in car design are evident at Geneva salon
international de l'automobile this week. Marginally different - you could
call them badge and grille engineered  - versions of a tall, chisel-nosed
vehicle jointly developed by the Fiat and Peugeot groups are on the Citroen,
Fiat, Lancia and Peugeot stands.
They prove that Renault got it absolutely right when it launched the Espace.
Ten years later it is still Europe's best selling multi-purpose people
carrier and, at any rate in styling, the new Fiat-Peugeot product looks
rather like a carbon copy.
Peugeot 806 and Citroen Evasion versions of the new vehicles, powered by
2.0-litre petrol engines, one of them turbo-charged, will go on sale on
mainland Europe in mid-summer. But Britain will have to wait another year
for right-hand drive production, by which time there will also be a
turbo-diesel.
The new MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) is front-wheel driven, has twin sliding
doors and takes five people plus a mass of luggage, or up to eight, all on
face-forward seats, if they are travelling light.
At the moment, MPVs are a minority choice in Europe with around 150,000 sold
annually, half of them Renault Espaces. The industry believes that by the
end of the decade it could be half-a-million, though this could be an
under-estimate if the current fashion for using on-off road 4 x 4s as car
substitutes should run out of steam. The MPV would then be a logical
replacement. Its driving position is as high and the interior space as
generous as an on-off roader's but it rides and handles like a normal car
and uses less fuel.
One of the most intriguing Geneva exhibits is the Lexus Landau, a research
prototype shown by ItalDesign that looks half way between a hatchback and an
MPV. It is based on a Toyota Lexus GS300 platform but has a V8 engine
instead of a V6 and four-wheel drive.
Although its body is 2ft (60cm) shorter than a Lexus GS300's, it is 2in
(5cm) taller and offers a lot more space for people and luggage. It is too
early for any talk of possible production. But the current Lexus GS300
luxury executive saloon owes a great deal to a Jaguar-engined ItalDesign
prototype called the Westminster displayed at Geneva four years ago. Jaguar
showed no interest in it. Toyota did and history could repeat itself. Today,
there is a trend away from sheer bulk. Reasonably enough, buyers want cars
that are large inside but do not take up too much road space - just like the
Lexus Landau.
There are new cars galore at Geneva. The recently introduced Volkswagen Golf
and Citroen ZX estate cars have been joined by a class rival, the Rover 400
Tourer, which has made its world debut at the salon.
Rover does not call its dual-purpose car an estate though that is what it
is. The elegant Rover 400 Touring has a high class and traditional-looking
interior. Buyers will have a choice of 1.6-litre or 2.0-litre petrol engines
or a 1.8 litre turbo-diesel when the car goes on sale in June, priced from
Pounds 14,495.
Renault's Laguna (this column, 19 Feb) and General Motors' new Vauxhall
(Opel) Omega which replaces the Vauxhall Carlton will be hotting up the
competition in the medium and medium/large company car market this year.
Omegas, which are rear-wheel driven, come with saloon or estate car bodies.
Petrol engines range from a 2-litre four-cylinder to a 3-litre in-line six
but the pick is the British-made 2.5-litre V6. The diesel has a turbocharged
straight six bought-in from BMW. Like the petrol cars, it will be available
with automatic transmission. Prices are expected to start at Pounds 16,000
when they go on sale next month.
Nissan chose Geneva as launch pad for its striking new 200SX
high-performance sporting coupe that competes with the new Toyota Celica
(described in this column last week). Yet another good looking two-door was
unveiled by Honda - the Accord coupe, conceived and built in the US. It is
due in Britain in May.
Two new German cars attracting a lot of attention are the BMW Compact, a
3-door variation on the 3-Series theme, and Audi's stunning all-light alloy
A8 luxury saloon.
Although the 1.6-litre or 1.8-litre engined Compact is aimed downmarket of
what one thinks of as typical BMW buyers, it concedes nothing in terms of
safety and convenience. Anti-lock brakes, driver airbag and power steering
are all part of the package.
Having been shown thinly disguised as a prototype last autumn at Frankfurt,
the Audi 8 was hardly a surprise. But it shows how a high performing luxury
saloon's weight and environmental impact can be reduced when other new
models generally get heavier.
More of the Audi A8 and other Geneva exhibits next week.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Entrepreneurs are sold short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGINA JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On January 15, Jane Whitehead told of how her dream of running her own small
shop turned into a nightmare. Georgina James, retail chairman British
Chambers of Commerce reflects on the experience.
As an independent fashion retailer myself Jane Whitehead's article, on the
rise and demise of her childrenswear shop was distressing. It deepened my
concern about the quality and effectiveness of UK business advice.
Did any adviser suggest she get some retail experience before launching into
such a volatile market? Did she discuss the pitfalls with a small
shopkeeper? Apparently not. Practical guidance seems to have been absent.
Absent it still is. Start-up failure rates remain depressingly high in spite
of training and enterprise councils, local enterprise companies, export
agencies, glossy Department of Trade and Industry brochures, business
bureaux, small firms services, college courses and a welter of government
subsidised initiatives.
There is one shining exception: the Prince's youth business trust. This
offers small loans or grants to disadvantaged people under 29 who have been
refused money from every other source. The real no-hopers one would think.
But 70 per cent make it to the end of the first year and 60 per cent to the
end of the third. These figures are more than double the average.
The trust's success is due to its system of giving a start-up unlimited
access to its own guardian angel - a volunteer who also runs a small or
medium-sized company and has experience of the problems.
Contrast this with official agencies. Each needs its own bureaucracy. Each
has financial targets and limits on its activities. Often the majority of
staff are ex-civil servants or managers from big companies, (seconded,
retired or redundant). They are experts in their fields, but not as
versatile as smaller company owners must be. They do not understand small
business culture.
Public funding is necessary because small companies need non-commercial
services. The government view is that it must keep tight hold of structure,
purse strings and policy. This contrasts starkly with its other view, that
direct service provision should be privatised.
It would be possible and proper for independent groups to take on this work
under contract; groups such as chambers of commerce which are directly
accountable to the business community.
At a Moscow conference of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development recently, I was the only speaker who earned my living running a
small business. I was mobbed by Russians eager for practical advice. The
eminent economists, civil servants, bankers and academics who also spoke
were unable to answer their questions.
More recently I met a TEC adviser and his client. He was a retired export
expert from a large clothing company. She had a talent for designing and
knitting jumpers. The TEC had matched them because they were both 'in
textiles'. It was an incompatible pairing. She needed to know things which
those in large companies never learn because so much is taken care of in
other departments.
Many UK business people are bewildered by the haphazard nature of official
help: they feel that bank managers, for example, know more about selling
pensions than they do about the nitty gritty of commercial life.
It is not enough to appoint a few business people to quangos and pretend
that this amounts to 'private sector control'. We have to find a way to
expand the system of linking those with ideas - but no experience and little
money - to those with small business nous and the desire to pass it on.
Until then the careers of many more eager entrepreneurs will be, in Thomas
Hobbes' words, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Future forged from the past -
Chris Topp works in wrought iron. He tells Clive Fewins why it is better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Topp did not stand at a forge and work hot metal until he was 27.
Seventeen years later he is one of England's best-known blacksmiths and the
force behind the move to 'rediscover' wrought iron.
Topp started The Campaign for Real Iron in the early 1980s when he realised
that the skills associated with the traditional material of the blacksmith
were disappearing.
'The last works producing wrought iron in this country closed in 1984. After
that, it was a case of running fast to pick up whatever stocks were
available,' said Topp. 'A limited amount is being produced at the Ironbridge
Gorge Museum. But 10 years ago the situation looked bleak.'
In 1980, Topp won a Pounds 9,000 contract to construct elegant early 18th
century-style gates and railings at a country house near York for a client
who appreciated the difference between the mild steel that was usually
supplied, and real wrought iron.
The problem was: where to find the wrought iron. He heard of a huge
stockpile, originally the handrail on the south pier at Sunderland, that was
about to be thrown away and dashed to the north east. He returned with 15
tons, a load that cost him Pounds 200, but which laid the foundations of his
business.
'In 1980 I moved to North Yorkshire from the restoration engineering company
I had been managing in Derbyshire to try to get away from people constantly
dropping in and asking me to mend prams and sledges,' said Topp. 'I managed
to buy the former village garage, which became my forge, plus the house that
went with it for Pounds 32,000.
'I was keen to get into some real restoration work, though initially I was
resigned to making fire irons, and mild steel gates masquerading under the
misnomer of wrought iron to sell to tourists and local garden centres.'
Fortunately, the York contract put paid to that. Through his former contacts
in Derbyshire and local conservation bodies Topp found he had enough
restoration work to support his wife and young daughter.
'My main desire was to do forge work,' said Topp. 'From an early age I had
been fascinated by iron. When I was at school in Bolton I used to go and
watch the men at the Atlas Ironworks, now reconstructed at Ironbridge.'
After gaining a degree in civil engineering at Newcastle University, Topp
worked briefly for British Waterways where he concentrated on jobs involving
18th and 19th century iron structures.
He started the Derbyshire workshop with a few old school friends, but when
that diversified in the late 1970s he decided to branch out on his own.
The original stockpile from Sunderland has long gone. In its place is a
stock of assorted vintages of wrought iron. Topp lovingly strokes a rusting
bar of metal and pronounces it some of the finest produced in the early 18th
century for the school of Jean Tijou.
He is using some of this to restore a magnificent pair of gates from Marston
Trussell Hall in Northamptonshire in a contract worth Pounds 10,000.
'This is the sort of work I love,' said Topp. 'The work at that period was
so delicate and well proportioned.' The end of the 18th century brought the
introduction of mass-produced puddled irons - inferior, in Topp's view, to
the earlier work made and refined in charcoal fires.
However for everyday purposes the two are indistinguishable.
'Both offer a resistance to rust and corrosion you will not find in steel,'
he said. 'Their fibrous nature means they are unsurpassed for ornamental
ironwork, where there is a lot of fine beaten three dimensional metalwork.
Wrought iron costs about five times as much as mild steel, which was
introduced in the 1850s. In spite of the cost, Topp has not had a slack
period in 14 years. He has supplied work to the Prime Minister's residence
at 10 Downing Street, Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, Warwick Castle, and
other famous and historic buildings.
'A Pounds 10,000 job is not a big contract nowadays,' Topp said. 'In 1992 we
turned over Pounds 85,000 and made a net profit of Pounds 21,000. Last year
we hit a very big seam of work and I hope the figures will show we doubled
that.
'One big job for six tons of wrought iron glazing bars in 19 different
sections for a large Dublin restoration job was worth almost Pounds 80,000.
Much of the work was more repetitious than I prefer, but for that size of
job it was worth it.'
Topp is midway through a Pounds 35,000 contract for decorated wrought iron
seaside railings - they include buckets and spades and windsurfers - for the
resort of Redcar.
One disappointment, however, is the market for cheaper one-off items made in
mild steel. 'There is intense competition for this sort of work  - railings
produced to a budget in city centres are a typical example. I reckon I need
to pull in Pounds 120 a day per man for that sort of work in order to be
profitable, but it has been nearer Pounds 80 recently. My two assistants are
self-employed, so it is important to them that we increase it.
'However, the order book for high quality fixed contract wrought iron work
is healthy, so in 1994 we shall probably concentrate increasingly on that
aspect of our work. This should help reduce the bank overdraft, currently
about half our upper limit of Pounds 15,000.'
One of Topp's recent innovations is to design and sell small furnaces for
blacksmiths to use as adjuncts to their forges. These allow smiths to heat
several bars at once so they can work in rotation on each bar. They thus
save time and make forge work cheaper and more competitive.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Briefcase, QA: Gentleman's agreement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
During the past two or three years, I have lent my eldest son a lot of money
to help with his business. We have a gentleman's agreement without formal
documentation. It is unlikely, however, that he will be able to repay me in
full for many years, possibly not in my lifetime.
My will leaves all my possessions to my wife. If she dies before me, they
are to be shared equally between my two sons. Does my son have to declare
the loan as income? Should I declare it as a gift? Are there implications
for income and inheritance tax?
Although no documentation was drawn up, a contract of loan still exists, and
you might now wish to document the terms as evidence of what was agreed
orally at an earlier date. No income tax implications arise for either you
or your sons. You receive no taxable interests; your son received the money
as capital.
For IHT purposes, the loan is not a gift. Your estate still has the right to
receive the money back. This right will be valued as part of your estate at
death and it will be inherited by your successors.
In the event that it is inherited by your sons, one half of the principal
amount will still be owed by one brother to the other. Given the
circumstances of the loan (ie, it is unlikely that it can be repaid on
demand), the value of the right received by you when you made the loan
originally is probably lower than the actual money lent.
The diminution in the valuation of your estate is a 'transfer' for IHT. I
consider this to be a potentially exempt transfer (PET) which might become
taxable if you die within seven years of making the loan. Alternatively, if
it is not a PET, it could be within the Pounds 150,000 nil rate band.
As your son repays the loan, this has no inheritance consequences for him.
It reduces the value to your estate of the right to receive the balance of
the principal outstanding.
If you wish to write off any part of the principal outstanding, the waiver
must be effected by a deed. Informal waivers (ie, by letter) are not
effective for tax purposes. A waiver constitutes a potentially exempt
transfer on each occasion one is made.
If you were to survive for seven years from the date of the transfer, then
no IHT will be payable at all and it would not affect your nil rate band. If
you were to die within the seven-year period, then the transfer could fall
within the nil rate band in any event.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Briefcase, QA: They're worried that I might die
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I run a family investment portfolio in which several members have invested
Pounds 3,000 each. Not surprisingly, some are worried they might lose their
money should I die. I have thought of three options, although each has
flaws:
1. To draw up a will. The trouble is, each time somebody cashes in their
unit or invests more money, I would need to prepare a new will and have it
witnessed.
2. To write out IOUs. These would not be ideal, though, as the value of the
portfolio changes from day to day. Besides which, would they have any
'legal' effect?
3. To issue certificates in the same way as unit trusts. Again, though, I am
concerned over the legality question and how exactly to proceed.
As I understand it, family members give you money to invest on their behalf.
You buy the shares (or other investment property) in your own name but,
presumably, keep a record of how much each family member contributes. In
effect, therefore, you own the shares as trustee for the various family
members.
The shares are not your property, although your name might be on the
certificates. Consequently, you cannot include in your will any provision
for the disposal/distribution of the portfolio investment, as a will can
provide only for the devolution of your own property.
It appears to me that, since what exists here is a trust, you should draw up
mutually-agreed written terms for its operation, including what will happen
on your death. This can be done quite informally so long as the written
constitution states clearly the intentions of the investors.
One suggestion is for the constitution to provide that, on your death, an
appointed person realises the investment assets in your name and that the
proceeds be distributed to the family members in proportion to the amounts
they have invested. Any contribution of your own into the portfolio remains
your own property; nevertheless, it can remain part of the trust property
with yourself as trustee and your estate as beneficiary. The above
suggestion deals with this situation.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: A mystery explained - Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading Eurobonds is a major part of the way institutional investors operate
but, contrary to popular belief, the market does not exist purely for their
benefit.
As Eurobonds offer some of the best yields available, every investor should
consider them. To prove anyone can acquire them, I visited the City branches
of several large clearing banks and asked their share-dealing services if I
could buy, and hold, a Eurobond through them.
They did not make it easy - but the problem seems to be that few people know
what a Eurobond is, let alone how to deal in one.
Bonds are simply a loan from the investor, in return for which there is
normally a fixed rate of interest and a fixed repayment date. In the
meantime, the loan can be bought and sold in the same manner as shares. The
most common example is UK government bonds, or gilts.
The prefix 'Euro' originated late in the 1950s when eastern European
countries transferred large amounts of dollars from American to European
banks. In 1993, Pounds 21bn worth of new issues were launched in sterling
alone, approximately 10 times as much as non-Eurobond issues.
Eurobonds trade in bearer form: that is, the share certificates are like
cash and the holder of the bond is assumed to be the owner. Each certificate
has coupons attached representing the interest payments; these must be
removed and presented for payment.
With a weekly turnover of more than Dollars 100bn, it is not practical - or
safe - for each buyer and seller to exchange their certificates in person.
Most stockbrokers overcome this by settling via one of the two main Eurobond
clearing houses - Euroclear (Brussels) and CEDEL (Luxembourg)  - but there
are charges for doing so. Eurobond dealing and handling charges generally
are higher than for gilts, but the impact on yields declines with larger
orders.
All bond markets have seen extreme turbulence recently; as a result, bonds
have produced negative returns of up to 8 per cent in 1994. The positive
side is that income-seekers can achieve high yield levels that have not been
available for months.
Michael Dyson is a director of BZW Capital Markets Ltd. This is a
market-maker and cannot deal with private clients direct. Readers interested
in buying bonds should approach a broker.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Options blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Inland Revenue statement this week could be bad news for globe-trotting
executives with lucrative share options. Fleeing the country will no longer
guarantee the tax-free status of option profits. But if the right steps are
taken before the option is first granted, the taxman's net can still be
avoided.
The exercise of an option by a director or employee generally will result in
a demand for income tax under section 135 of the 1988 Taxes Act. This is
levied on the amount by which the then value of the shares exceeds their
cost.
The strict legal position is that if an executive is resident in the UK when
he is granted the option, his exercise will be caught by section 135 - even
if he is no longer living there at the time. In practice, the Revenue has
taken a much more lenient view. For many years, its stated policy was: 'If
the director or employee has ceased to be resident in the UK at the time he
exercises the option, the question of a charge will not normally arise.'
Three years ago, the Revenue decided to re-define 'normally' in a way which
pointed the section 135 pistol at the heads of most expatriate
option-holders. This week, the full U-turn was completed as what remained of
the Revenue's concessionary treatment was withdrawn for options exercised on
or after April 6.
Since the letter of the law clearly backs the Revenue, any attempt to resist
a tax demand on option profits will be futile. Remaining abroad with all
your assets might stop the tax being collected - but that is hardly
satisfactory. The only real escape route will be for options to be granted
under an 'approved' share scheme.
The benefit of Revenue approval is that the section 135 tax charge generally
will be avoided. Hence, the executive's only potential liability would be
CGT when, ultimately, he sold the shares - and non-residents are exempt from
CGT.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT and indexation . . . - In this,
the second of a series on capital gains tax, Richard Chant and Alan Sugden
deal with indexation and how to match sales of a security with purchases
made at different times after March 31 1982
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD CHANT and ALAN SUGDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The purpose of indexation
In order to avoid charging CGT on that element of a realised gain caused by
inflation since March 1982, the cost of securities acquired after March 31
of that year is indexed by the change in the retail price index from the
month of purchase or acquisition to the month of disposal.
(Note that the month of purchase is the month of the contract's date, not
the settlement date).
Calculation of indexation using factors
The Inland Revenue issues a monthly table of indexation factors. These apply
to the original cost of a holding sold in that month.
For example, its January 1994 table (not shown here) gave a factor of 0.665
for June 1983. Thus, if shares bought for Pounds 1,000 in June 1983 were
sold in January 1994, the calculation needed to work out the indexed cost
would be: Pounds 1,000 + (Pounds 1,000 x 0.665) Pounds 665 = Pounds 1,665.
An alternative and simpler indexation tool is provided in Table 1. By adding
1 to all the factors published by the Revenue, the FT allows you to cut the
calculation down.
Simply multiply the original cost by the adjusted factor: ie, 1.665. So,
Pounds 1,000 x 1.665 = Pounds 1,665.
Where to find the factors
A table of adjusted CGT indexation allowances is published each month -
usually on the last Saturday - in the Weekend FT. These cover allowances for
the previous month. Those for January 1994 were published on February 26.
(See Table 1).
Calculation of indexation factors
The indexation factor is calculated like this. Take the retail price index
(RPI) in the month of disposal and subtract the RPI in March 1982 (or the
actual month acquired, if later). Divide the resulting figure by the RPI in
March 1982 (or the actual month acquired, if later).
Here, for example, is how to work out the factor for the sale of an asset
acquired in June 1983 and sold in January 1994, using the RPIs from Table 2:
RPI January 1994 - RPI June 1983 / RPI June 1983 gives you (141.3 - 84.8)
56.5 / 84.8 = 0.66627. Rounded to the nearest third decimal place, this
would give 0.666.
The difference between this and the published factor of 0.665 is due to the
published RPI figures being themselves rounded.
Calculation of indexation using RPI
Alternatively, you can use the monthly RPIs, which are produced by the
government statistical service and published widely in the financial press.
Each year, for instance, Accountancy magazine produces a complete table of
RPIs going back to 1915, and this is updated each month in the FT table.
(See Table 2).
In our example above, taking the RPIs for June 1983 (84.8) and January 1994
(141.3) from Table 2, the calculation is quite simple. The indexed cost =
original cost x RPI for the month of sale / RPI for the month of purchase -
or Pounds 1,000 x 141.3 / 84.8 = Pounds 1,666.
Either method (factor or RPI) is acceptable to the Inland Revenue providing
it is consistent. In other words, you must stick to one method all the time.
A great advantage of using the RPI is that you need only one table of RPIs
rather than a factor table for each month.
What happens when the RPI is static or falling
If the RPI for the month of disposal is the same or less than the RPI for
the month of acquisition (or the RPI for March 1982 if acquired pre-March 31
1982), then indexation would be nil. (That is, there is no 'negative
indexation' if the RPI falls).
Share pooling for stock acquired after April 5 1982
Where you add to your existing holding of a security, and all your previous
purchases have been later than April 5 1982, your total holding of that
security is treated as a single asset. If you dispose of part of your
holding, the disposal is treated as a partial disposal.
Ignoring indexation for the moment, let us consider a shareholder who
invests in the ordinary 10p shares of Stakis, the Scottish-based hotel group
(see Table 3).
Stakis fell on hard times due to rapid and imprudent expansion, sometimes
into activities unrelated to its main business; it even acquired a
stockbroking firm, Robert Wigram  Co., in September 1987, the month before
the market crashed. It took a change of management, the disposal of
peripheral activities and a one-for-three 'rescue' rights issue to turn the
company round.
Now let us include indexation. Table 4 shows how:
1. The cost of the original holding is indexed from the month of the
original purchase to the month of the rights issue.
2. The total cost is indexed to the month in which 4,000 shares were sold.
This is the method that Revenue legislation stipulates; a re-calculation of
the indexed cost should be made every time an 'operative event' occurs. An
operative event is any event which either increases or reduces the cost of a
holding.
This is fine if you are programming the calculation for a computer, but not
if you are a small private shareholder working it out by hand. In this case,
you can simplify the process by doing the calculation only when a disposal
takes place.
First, you either index the original cost to the date of this disposal; or,
if there has been a prior disposal from the holding, index the indexed cost
of the residual holding at the date of the last disposal to the date of this
disposal.
Then, you index the cost of each subsequent purchase from the date of
acquisition to the date of this disposal.
In our Stakis shareholder example, the shareholder has made no previous
disposals (see Table 5). We will deal with the treatment of securities
acquired before March 31 1982 in our next article.
Proposed changes to the rules on indexation
In his November Budget, the chancellor announced that for disposals made on
or after November 30 (the day after the Budget), indexation would be allowed
only to reduce or eliminate a capital gain. That is, it cannot be used to
create or increase a loss. In addition, as we mentioned last week, the
indexation of the cost of holdings of negligible value is ruled out for
negligible-value claims made after November 29, even if the Revenue had
deemed them to be of negligible value before then.
These proposals are contained in the Finance Bill now going through
Parliament and are not expected to be altered.
Payment for shares by instalment - acquisition date
If you subscribe for an issue of shares and pay for them by instalments,
indexation of their cost is calculated as follows:
1. For privatisation issues: from the date you acquire the shares.
2. For other issues: (a) If all instalments are payable within a 12-month
period, from the date by which the first payment has to be made; (b) If
payments are spread over more than 12 months, from the date by which each
instalment had to be paid.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Bad bets that threaten us all -
Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suppose you went into a clothing shop expecting to buy some garments but
found only people looking at computer screens. The manager says: 'We can't
sell you any clothes. Perhaps, though, you might like to gamble on the price
of jeans going up over the next month or so? Or maybe you would like a bet
on the direction of heating costs for garment manufacturers?'
You protest: 'I just want a designer silk waistcoat, small-sized. I believe
it will be a good investment and will serve me well for years.'
'Ah,' replies the manager. 'we cannot provide such things any more. But
perhaps you might like to give us some money and let our computerised
trading system invest in a wide range of waistcoats, including one or two
made of silk - although, to be honest, a few probably will fall to pieces.
You won't be able to handle any of the garments, either, as we keep them to
sell - some sight unseen - to other traders.'
If you asked the manager why he no longer sold clothes direct to the public,
he might tell you: 'Well, it's such a bother. People have got to actually
make the clothes, transport them to us, and then we have to hand them
physically to customers. By trading in all these other things instead, we
can do everything electronically, at the touch of a button, and it's much
more profitable for us.'
All this might seem rather ridiculous - but replace 'garment' and
'waistcoat' with 'direct shareholding in a small manufacturing company' and
the comparisons with today's financial markets become more obvious.
Recently, I tried to increase my shareholding in a small, well-managed
company. Only 10,000 shares were available, though, and it proved impossible
to buy any more even though I was willing to pay more than the supposed
market price for them.
It appears that I have become old-fashioned. Over the years, I have made
respectable profits by investing in small companies that actually made
something - companies that I saw as having particular strengths and likely
to grow. The thing is, I bought shares only after a certain amount of
personal research and investigation. Now, it is the fashion to let others
make the investment decisions and, increasingly, shares in companies are
being bought because they happen to be in a particular index.
The derivatives market, too, has increased dramatically its influence over
the share prices of many companies. Last year in the UK, more than Pounds
9bn was poured into unit trusts. There are now so many that choosing between
them is even more difficult than deciding on an individual company's shares.
Investment trusts also have multiplied. At one time, many seemed a 'bargain'
because their shares stood at a discount to their net asset value. But I
suspect that many investors who bought these just a few years ago will be
surprised if they turn to the FT's share price pages. It is amazing how many
of these trusts now have a premium rating, being valued at more than their
assets.
I have nothing against unit and investment trusts. A number have produced an
excellent performance, more than tripling their investors' money over five
years. Equally, some have performed very badly, turning Pounds 1,000 into
less than Pounds 900 after five years. It is examples like these that make
me want to continue making my own, direct investment decisions in individual
companies.
Even when I find a company which I think is undervalued, however, its share
price still can be clobbered by institutional investors switching out of it
 -not because they dislike its management or prospects but because a
short-term computer program made them do it. Or because it has been pushed
out of an index, perhaps by a 'bubble' company that has grown larger because
of hype and over-expectation.
Even more scary is the increasingly powerful influence on the market of
financial derivatives. Again, I have nothing against trading in options and
futures, particularly when it is used as a hedge to protect exposure to
foreign currencies and a variety of commodities. But it seems to me that too
many people are now treating these markets like casinos. For every bank that
announces huge profits on its dealings in derivatives, someone, somewhere,
must have made correspondingly large losses.
The amount of money 'trading' on foreign exchange markets world-wide each
day has been calculated to be considerably more than the value of world
trade. And, in a number of countries, exposure to dealings in derivatives
does not have to be revealed to regulatory authorities.
The next stock market crash could well be triggered by dealings in
derivatives: people making too many wrong bets that a share index will rise
or fall or that the price of a currency, commodity, bonds, or a combination
of financial instruments will perform in a particular way.
Surely the time is approaching fast when people ought to stand back from
these markets and re-evaluate where they - and their countries - are going.
What future is there for a nation's industry when it is easier for people to
bet on a possibility - something that cannot even be touched - than it is
for a private investor to buy shares in a small company that makes something
people want to buy?

pension (industry average 1.6 per cent)
Penalties on early retirement or termination: Yes, where commission is paid
on regular premium plan, cost of that commission is recouped in full. Also,
an extra charge if contract terminated within first two years. No charges

Managed unit-linked fund regular premium contract average over five years,
slightly below average over 10, single premium contract above average; UK
equity fund in top quartile over five years but performance below average

Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment may
produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance
and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real
charges on the final fund of Standard Life's managed unit-linked plan, we
asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45 who expects to
retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month
and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds 10,000.
Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are lower than
those used by most life offices, are shown in brackets. The last
illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges were deducted.

 ---------------------------------------------------------
As can be seen, where full commission is paid, Standard Life's charges are
significantly higher than the Lautro basis, yielding a lower projected
return. When the commission cost is stripped out, the reverse is true on the
monthly premium plan at the higher growth rate but elsewhere Standard Life's
charges are still higher than the Lautro basis. The life office's charges
are above the industry average on regular and single premium unit-linked
contracts for virtually all investment periods but are lower than average on
longer term with-profits contracts.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Why Standard slipped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, founded in 1825, is the largest mutual insurer in Europe and,
arguably, one of the most successful. It is also one of the biggest
providers of personal pension plans, with just under 500,000 sold since
1988.
Its financial credentials include a top rating of AAA from both Standard 
Poor's and the other main US rating agency, Moody's Investors Services.
Continuity of investment staff is good and it has a tradition of strong,
conservative investment performance over the long term. But recent results
have been mixed.
The managed unit-linked fund is one of the largest on the market at Pounds
2,3bn, and clients with a regular premium contract will have seen returns
just above average over five years and just below average over 10. Where a
single premium investment was selected, the same fund shows consistently
above-average returns, reflecting the lower charges and commissions
associated with these contracts.
The main managed fund invests in several funds, including property, but the
managed 'stock exchange' fund excludes property. Both had below-average
returns in 1993, although they began to rally early this year.
Alan Goodman, assistant general manager for marketing, says: 'After several
years of good stock selections and a favourable bias towards UK investment,
the managed fund suffered from the effective devaluation of sterling
following its withdrawal from the ERM (exchange rate mechanism) in September
1992.
'Moreover, from late 1992 and for most of 1993, overseas equities performed
better than the UK market. The managed fund was underweight in this area
compared with other funds.'
Several of the society's funds reveal a peak in 1991/92 followed by relative
decline. The UK equity fund, also one of the largest in its sector with
Pounds 1,745m under management, achieved top quartile (top 25 per cent)
results over a rolling five-year period. But a closer look reveals a peak
performance in 1991, followed by below-average returns for 1993. The same
holds for the European and North American funds. Equally volatile are funds
earmarked for a lower risk approach.
The cash fund dropped to the bottom quartile in the year to February 1 1994
but maintains an above-average return over five years. The fixed-interest
fund peaked in 1991 and 1992 but dropped to the bottom quartile in the year
to February 1 1994, while the with-profits fund returned below-average
performance for virtually every investment period.
Standard Life sells 80 per cent of its products through Independent
Financial Advisers and 20 per cent through direct sales and tied agents but
recently split from its most important tied agent, the Halifax building
society. And while Standard's rates of commission to IFAs are average for
the industry, its charges are comparatively high.
On regular premium plans, you pay a 5 per cent initial charge (bid/offer
spread). There is an annual investment management charge of 0.875 per cent,
plus an extra annual charge of 1.5 per cent on all units bought during the
first two years. This extra charge is levied for up to 25 years on these
units although it is waived where the adviser does not take commission.
There is no initial charge on single premiums but there is a monthly service
charge of Pounds 3.05 on all contracts.
The society has been a major player in the transfer market, with around
66,500 plans sold to employees who have transferred their benefits to a
personal pension; this represents about 14 per cent of sales. But in 1992 it
suspended transfer business from tied agents while checks were carried out
on sales techniques. Goodman says: 'The entire advice process is reviewed
before any application is acted upon.'

Henry is 40 and works for a merchant bank in the City of London; it pays him
Pounds 70,000 a year. On April 6, he will hand back his present company car,
a one-year-old Rover Sterling with a list price of Pounds 27,795 and take
delivery of a new BMW 525i SE costing Pounds 25,850.
Four years ago he married Fiona, an art teacher now aged 33 and earning
Pounds 15,000; she also has freelance income of about Pounds 1,000 a year.
They have no children.
Henry has stock exchange investments worth Pounds 90,000, in which he deals
fairly actively. Fiona's parents gave her Pounds 100,000 when she married
(although nothing since), which was invested in a house which she owns
jointly with Henry.
He is feeling pleased with his financial acumen as he has:
Transferred investments to Fiona, which she sold in 1993/94 and realised
gains of Pounds 3,000 tax-free. (He has used his own CGT allowance already.)
Persuaded Fiona's parents that they should use their IHT exemptions and each
give her Pounds 6,000 before April 6.
Persuaded the managing director to order him to drive to Scotland to see a
client late this month: this will bring his business mileage to more than
2,500.
Henry calculates he has saved the couple Pounds 1,200 in CGT by giving the
investments to Fiona. By driving more than 2,500 business
miles in 1993-94, he has reduced the tax on his car by Pounds 1,242 (40 per
cent of Pounds 9,315 minus Pounds 6,210).
He expects he will drive more than 2,500 miles on business in his BMW next
year, too. The new benefit value for 1994-95 will be Pounds 6,032, rather
than the Pounds 6,210 scale charge for the Rover in 1993-94.
With almost Pounds 2,442 in hand for the present year and more in the bush
for next, Henry is in the mood to celebrate. He plans to take Fiona for a
weekend in Gleneagles while they decide how to spend it.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Plan to slash your tax bill - The
best ways to make the most of your allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW RADICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year, the Treasury collects a multi-million pound bonus from taxpayers
who do not make full use of allowances and reliefs to which they are
entitled. The main areas in which you can reduce your tax bill are:
Income tax
Everyone has a personal allowance of at least Pounds 3,445 for the 1993/94
tax year (more for older taxpayers). On top of this, the first Pounds 2,500
is taxed at 20 per cent and the next Pounds 21,200 at 25 per cent; above
this, you are in the 40 per cent bracket. Families should make sure
income-producing assets are in the right hands to take maximum advantage of
allowances and the 20 and 25 per cent rate bands.
Married couples can elect - on form 17, obtainable from their local tax
office - for income from jointly-held property to be divided between husband
and wife in accordance with their beneficial interests in the property. This
election is effective only from the date the form is signed, however, so it
is worth thinking about now for 1994/95.
A word of warning on gifts to children: if a parent puts capital into trust
for a child, only the first Pounds 100 of income is regarded as the child's
for tax purposes; the rest is treated as that of the parent. But if a
grandparent puts capital into trust for a grandchild, the income is the
child's for tax purposes (this is also good inheritance tax planning).
The tax relief on the married couple's allowance (Pounds 1,720) is worth
only 20 per cent in 1994/95, so it will not be worth transferring this to
the wife unless the husband's income is below the threshold. Couples for
whom this transfer will be an advantage should get a form 18 from the
Revenue and return it by April 5.
Married couples with a joint mortgage have until April 5 to elect for the
interest paid in the 1992/93 tax year and thereafter to be allocated between
them in whatever proportion they choose. Normally, this is the only way in
which you can get tax relief on a second mortgage.
If they do not make this election, the interest is divided equally between
them. But, unlike Miras, this interest attracts relief at the top marginal
rate of tax of the person to whom it is allocated. This can make a very
considerable difference to a couple where one spouse pays tax at 40 per cent
and the other at 20 or 25 per cent.
If you have had a bank deposit of Pounds 50,000 or more which pays interest
gross for a number of years, it might well be to your advantage to close it
and re-open it by April 5. Your tax assessment for the 1993/94 tax year
(which you should have paid on January 1) will have been based on the
interest credited to your account in 1992/93. If you close your account now,
your assessment for 1993/94 will instead be based on the interest credited
in 1993/94. Because of the sharp fall in interest rates over the period, you
should get a repayment of tax.
You do, however, need also to look at your tax assessment for 1992/93, which
will be based on the interest credited in 1991/92. If you close your
account, the Revenue could revise the 1992/93 assessment to the amount you
actually received in 1992/93. Since interest rates generally were lower in
1992/93 than 1991/92, the Revenue normally will not seek to revise the
1992/93 assessment. But you should look at the facts of your own case before
acting.
The scope for employees to reduce their tax bills is limited. It is worth
bearing in mind that the tax drops by a third if you drive more than 2,500
business miles in your company car by April 5. If your employer is unwilling
to send you on the necessary business trip, you could remind him that his
own National Insurance contribution on your car also goes down by a third.
If you are considering paying additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into
a pension scheme, do so by April 5 if you want tax relief against your
income for 1993/94. If, however, you expect your income to rise considerably
in the next tax year and you will pay tax at 40 per cent rather than 25,
then it could make sense to defer payment of the AVCs until after April 5.
The contributions will be invested in the fund for almost as long and they
will have enjoyed tax relief at a higher rate.
Contributors to personal pension plans should also look at their position
before April 5. This is the last day for paying a premium which is to be
treated as paid in the 1992/93 tax year, so reducing the tax bill for that
year. Any relief still unused from 1987/88 will no longer be available after
that date.
Capital gains tax
You will know more after March 26 when you have finished reading the Weekend
FT series by Richard Chant and Alan Sugden. But there will be only five
working days left in the tax year after then, so here are some points for
those who want to act now.
Everyone has a tax-free CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800 for the tax year
1993/94; this cannot be carried forward. Investors should aim to bed and
breakfast (ie, sell and re-purchase) shares which are showing gains, thus
using up the allowance and increasing the cost to be used in future sales.
Transfers of assets between husbands and wives are tax-free. Since CGT is
payable at an investor's top marginal rate of income tax, it makes sense
first to use both spouses' allowances of Pounds 5,800 and then to route
sales through the spouse with the lower rate of tax.
You should take care to ensure that the paperwork is in order if you are
thinking of transferring assets before sale. In particular, the sale
proceeds should not find their way back to the spouse who is supposed to
have given them away.
If you are already over the CGT threshold for 1993/94 and are about to sell
an asset with a large gain, doing this after April 5 means you will defer
payment of the tax until December 1 1995. Also, if you are over the
threshold, consider if you can reduce your bill by making a negligible value
claim before April 5.
Inheritance tax
This is levied at 40 per cent on a person's estate on death although the
first Pounds 150,000 is exempt. You can reduce your estate by giving away
assets; providing you live seven years afterwards, no IHT will be due on
them. You can also give away up to Pounds 3,000 each tax year and the gift
will be entirely tax-free; if you do not use up this allowance in a year,
the unused part is carried forward for another year.
In addition, you can give away up to Pounds 250 each year to as many people
as you like. Thus, if you did not make any gifts in 1992/93, you can give
away up to Pounds 6,000 by April 5 this year; this will be ignored for IHT
purposes. Bear in mind, however, that CGT is payable on gifts of portfolio
investments to your children.
Value added tax
Unless you are planning to move house, pre-pay domestic electricity and gas
bills before the 8 per cent VAT is introduced on April 1.
Investments
You can put up to Pounds 9,000 each tax year into personal equity plans  -
Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep.
Income and capital gains are tax-free, so the only charges are those of the
fund manager.
Other tax-free products include National Savings certificates; the 41st
issue pays 5.40 per cent, which is equivalent to 9 per cent gross for a 40
per cent taxpayer.
Remember . . .
If you were not sent a tax return for 1992/93, but had a new source of gross
income or a capital gain on which tax is due, make sure to tell the Revenue
by April 5 to avoid a penalty.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Putting people first - Cripps
Harries Hall, seventh in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers may not be everyone's idea of sympathetic independent financial
advisers but David Lough, once a merchant banker, argues that solicitor
firms can bring special qualities to investment and financial management.
Lough's own experience appears to support this view. In 1988, he set up the
finance and investment services division of Cripps Harries Hall, a solicitor
based in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. It now has 21 staff, 600 investment clients
and Pounds 76m under managment.
Lough, a client of Cripps Harries Hall before he joined the staff, says he
'saw an opening for a firm that could draw together all the strands of a
person's affairs.' His division - which provides pension, mortgage and
insurance services as well as investment and cash management - is staffed
entirely by financial and investment specialists. None is a solicitor.
According to Lough, the operation aims at 'stewardship of a family's money,'
and he feels solicitor firms are ideal for providing this. They start from
the right ethical platform, having always disclosed commissions; they handle
client money, but their regulatory armour is all but bullet-proof; and they
can integrate a client's legal and tax affairs with his financial planning.
Lough went to Cripps Harries Hall from County NatWest, where he was managing
director throughout the deregulation dramas of the 1986 Big Bang. 'I didn't
really enjoy it that much,' he says, 'although it was a real crucible of
learning. But, at the end of the day, you were dealing with basis points for
institutions. It is more fun dealing with things that matter for people.'
His private clients are a diverse bunch; they include investment bankers and
the directors of top 100 companies as well as retired bank managers and
teachers. There is no minimum investment requirement although, if people
have less than around Pounds 50,000 in investable assets, they are advised
to opt for a series of four or five investment trusts. He says: 'We explain
that they are paying the investment trusts to manage the assets for them.'
Charges normally are on a fixed scale. Three-quarters of the clients opt for
discretionary investment management, the fee for which is 0.6 per cent a
year on the first Pounds 400,000, 0.25 per cent on the next Pounds 400,000,
and 0.125 per cent after that. Minimum charge is Pounds 595.
Each client has an individual portfolio, even for personal equity plans.
When they receive their twice-yearly valuations, the performance achieved on
their behalf is measured against a composite benchmark, which is matched to
their investment aims.
Lough is cautious about investing. He says: 'We are not right for someone
who wants trading-based service and who wants to be in and out of the
account. Our emphasis is very much on the long term. And our clients quite
like the fact that we are naturally prudent, conservative investment
managers. If they had an enormous risk appetite, they probably wouldn't come
to us.'
Unsurprisingly, therefore, the investment management successes have been
with solid companies such as BAA, Marks and Spencer and Shell. House-builder
Berkeley also has produced 'wonderful results' for CHH clients with large
portfolios. On the other hand, British Steel has proved a disappointment.
Lough says: 'I have come to the conclusion that it is just too political an
industry.'
He adds: 'Private clients judge you by a subtle series of values, such as
whether you are efficient in your administration; whether you have taken the
trouble to understand their position; and whether staff are helpful on the
telephone. You can lose your client's trust very quickly if you make
mistakes. They will think you are a shoddy operation and they are quite
right.'
He encourages clients to visit Tunbridge Wells for a first meeting 'so they
can see the set-up and the people. This is very much a team approach.' By no
means everyone arrives with their affairs in order, though. Sometimes,
detective work is needed to establish a new client's capital gains tax
position. One even arrived with a suitcase stuffed with share certificates.
'He had no idea what they were worth,' says Lough. 'Actually, it was more
than Pounds 500,000.'
Cripps Harries Hall cites provision of comprehensive financial and
investment services as a major point of difference between itself and many
other solicitor firms. But Lough believes the time is coming when solicitors
generally 'will have to decide whether they are willing for stockbrokers to
take over a client's investment affairs, or whether they are going to go
full tilt at it themselves. So far, it has been firms in large provincial
towns and cities, with big retired populations, that have acted.'
There are undoubted signs that the role of solicitor firms as investment
managers for private clients has revived in recent years; indeed, Lough
chairs the Association of Solicitor Investment Managers, which was founded
in July 1993 as a forum for such firms. To date, the association's directory
lists 17 members which, collectively, manage more than Pounds 600m of
private client money. Apparently, others are queueing to join.
Lough says: 'We formed the association because we felt there was very little
public awareness of solicitors' investment and financial services for
clients. The ethical base of solicitor firms has always been excellent. And
we believe that the firms which belong to the association add a skills base,
too.'

Fortune Oil, formerly Blackland Oil, has had a turbulent history in recent
years. The share price began to strengthen around the turn of the year but
directors have been selling over the past month. Vice-chairman Malcolm Stone
sold 4m at between 6-7p while board colleague Rupert Lycett Green has sold
1m at between 6.25-6.5p.
Philip Gwyn, chairman of Christie Group has sold 1m shares at 73.5p but
retains more than 5m. The group provides support services to businesses and
the shares stood at well over Pounds 2 in mid-1989. Although there were
losses in each of the past two years, interim results in November showed a
return to the black.
Porvair, the synthetic materials group, has made steady progress over the
past three years. Against the background of a strongly performing share
price, technical director Allen Halliwell has sold 60,000 at between
270-297p.
Floated in November, Towry Law, an integrated financial services company,
has been riding high on the back of buoyant market conditions. A director,
Clive Scott-Hopkins, has sold 150,000 shares at 217p, reducing his holding
to 445,000. Earnings are forecast to rise to 10.2p in the year to end-June
1994.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Save tax the BB way - But you must
stick to the rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in the stock market means many people may own shares that have
increased considerably in value. The Inland Revenue expects the number of
investors paying capital gains tax in 1993/94 to grow to 125,000 from only
85,000 in 1992/93.
Bed and breakfasting shares is one way of trying to lower the potential CGT
bill, but it can be expensive. Everyone has an annual exemption from CGT of
Pounds 5,800; by selling shares one day and buying them back the next, you
can make gains up to this limit, tax-free. Also, the shares would have a
higher base cost, which would increase the amount of indexation relief
available.
The Revenue disapproves of BB deals but is coy about telling investors what
might invalidate them for fear of giving away tax-planning advice. The
cardinal rule is that the shares must be exposed fully to the market, with
no agreement between broker and market-maker to re-purchase.
'Bed and Pepping' has also become popular, but you cannot simply transfer a
holding of shares into a personal equity plan. Its manager must have cleared
funds with which to buy shares on your behalf.
The cost of BB can be expensive compared with the potential tax saving but
many brokers waive the commission on purchases although stamp duty of 0.5
per cent has to be paid. The table below lists some of the offers.
Those with unit trusts depend on the fund manager reducing the initial
charge when the units are bought back. Each company has its own policy on
this.
There are dangers as well as costs: you are exposed to overnight
developments in world markets and could wake up to find your shares are very
expensive or, if the company is small, impossible to buy back.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Wimpey cheer - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey, the housebuilder which announces on Tuesday, has substantially
increased volume sales and will also benefit from improved margins. The
company, which in 1992 made a Pounds 112m pre-tax loss after provisions of
Pounds 113.8m, could have made a profit of about Pounds 30m last year.
English China Clays' results on Monday are likely to show a drop from Pounds
100.2m in 1992 to about Pounds 85m in 1993, including about Pounds 15m to
Pounds 20m of land sales.
Williams Holdings is expected to report annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
153m (Pounds 161m), after a Pounds 17m goodwill charge on the disposal of
the engineering businesses. Williams watchers will want indications on the
future of the electronics division, earmarked for eventual disposal.
When United Biscuits announces its full-year figures on Thursday, the chief
uncertainty is how much UB will write off in closures and restructuring at
its struggling US subsidiary, Keebler.
However, it seems that profits will be down not only in the US, but in the
UK as well. A best guess for pre-tax profit is around Pounds 170m (Pounds
162m). This allows only for exceptional events already announced. In other
words, underlying profits may be down.
Guinness, reporting on Thursday,expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 905m,
compared with an underlying Pounds 920m the year before. From that will be
deducted a Pounds 30m charge for UK pensions and a largely non-cash charge
of Pounds 173m on the LVMH transaction, leaving Pounds 702m.
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, will announce on Thursday
its first full-year results since the merger. Analysts are forecasting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 530m.
Rentokil, the environmental and property services group, is expected to
maintain its record of 20 per cent compound growth by reporting annual
profits of about Pounds 147m on Thursday. Analysts will want a progress
report on Securiguard, the security and cleaning company which Rentokil
bought for Pounds 76m last July after a hostile takeover battle.
Legal  General, the life and composite insurer, will announce its results
on Thursday. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits to rise to about Pounds
175m, after Pounds 116m in 1992.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beazer Homes, one of the UK's four biggest national house-builders, is being
split off from the Hanson conglomerate and floated into a buoyant stock
market sector, writes John Thornhill. The placing and public offer, arranged
by Lazard Brothers, values Beazer Homes at Pounds 463.4m. The issue price of
165p a share equates to 14.5 times historic earnings and gives a notional
gross dividend yield of 3.8 per cent. That is a modest rating relative to
the sector.
Beazer Homes has strong management, a relatively cheap land bank, and a
sound balance sheet. It will receive Pounds 50m of the flotation proceeds to
help fund its expansion programme. Its earnings growth is likely to prove
less dynamic than that produced by many other house-builders, though. The
company already has high margins and will rely chiefly on volume growth to
expand profits.
House-building is a highly cyclical industry which is in the early stages of
an up-swing. Last year, the industry had its first year of growth since
1988, with the number of new completions rising 5 per cent to 148,100. At
the last peak, in 1988, builders completed 203,000 new houses.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Selection is all when you're
thinking small - What investors should know about emerging companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging companies seem likely to join emerging markets as flavour of the
year. The two stories have a lot in common. Both start with the premise that
it is intrinsically easier for a company or economy to advance rapidly if it
starts from a very low base. Just as growth in the Pacific Rim economies is
significantly faster than that in the developed economies, so a relatively
new company with a good business can often expand much faster than ICI. As
one stock market pundit put it: 'Elephants don't gallop.'
Before you get caught up in the general euphoria, however, there are four
questions to ask. Is the basic argument in favour of investing in smaller
companies sound? Is this a good moment to be buying? What are the snags? And
what are the best ways into the market?
Why buy small companies?
Over the long term, small companies as a whole have performed much better
than the giants. Look at our first chart. This tracks the smallest companies
on the main UK equity market, (the 1,279 individual companies in the Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies index) against the FT-SE-A All-Share index (which
includes the 853 biggest quoted companies).
If you go back to the mid-1950s, a modest investment of Pounds 10 in smaller
companies then would by now have grown to Pounds 890, compared with only
Pounds 300 from a similar investment in the All-Share. This does not mean
that buying tiddlers always pays. In some years the giants prevail,
particularly when markets as a whole are going through a bad patch, such as
the mid-1970s, late '80s and early '90s. Last year, though, the smaller
companies came through strongly and have continued to hold up so far in
1994.
Our second chart takes the FT-SE small cap index (which is roughly
comparable to the the Hoare Govett index) and tracks it against the FT-SE
100 index of corporate giants.
Very broadly, small companies tend to flourish when the economy is expanding
but are more vulnerable than large ones when recession bites. Not all
individual small companies exemplify this pattern, though, either long term
or short term; early this decade, they seemed to be dying like flies. And
even when the index is doing well, there will always be enormous variations
between the performance of individual companies.
Reasons for the growth in profits and share prices also vary. What investors
like most - because it will give them long-term outperformance - are small
companies with a simple, profitable formula that can provide above-average
growth for several years.
Peter Lynch, who built up Fidelity's best-known mutual fund, Magellan,
called such shares 'tenbaggers' - those with the potential to give tenfold
returns. But, in the recent smaller company boom, many of the strongest
performances have come from companies which nearly went bust but survived to
fight another day.
The first of our individual company charts shows what happened to an
acquisitive little textile company called Hartstone, which looked like a
real growth story - at least a fivebagger - but ultimately came unstuck. The
second chart shows how jewellery company Signet, the former Ratners, clawed
its way back from the brink.
Conclusion: although small companies as a whole have done better
historically than larger ones, there are periods in which they do worse  -
and many individual companies fail to conform to the norm. So, it is helpful
to buy at the right time and essential to invest in the right companies.
Is this a good time to buy?
Most pundits reckon small companies are unlikely to produce such strong
relative share price performance this year as last. The shares are starting
to look very highly priced already when measured against their actual
earnings although earnings should grow strongly.
One argument from enthusiasts is that UK markets are repeating the pattern
already set by US markets - and US smaller companies have outperformed by
some 40 per cent since they bottomed late in 1990. So, UK smaller companies,
which have outperformed by a paltry 30 per cent since they touched bottom
late in 1992, must have further potential. Well, maybe.
An alternative argument is that even if British smaller companies have
nearly run out of puff, there is still scope in smaller companies overseas.
European economic recovery is relatively immature. On this analysis, the
American small company boom is pretty mature, the British one ripe but with
a bit further to go, and the European one just on the launching pad.
What are the snags?
Anyone who owned smaller company shares late in 1987 will not need reminding
that smaller companies can be illiquid. This innocuous-sounding word means
you cannot always buy when you want to (or not without moving the price
against yourself) and you cannot always sell when you want to - at any
price. In addition, the gap between buying and selling prices - the spread -
could be much wider than it would be with a large company. This means your
shares must rise further before you can genuinely notch up a profit.
Some fund managers are already finding it hard to buy as many shares as they
want in companies they like. But others argue that the stream of attractive
new issues is alleviating this problem.
How should you invest?
Your can either invest directly in smaller company shares, or buy a smaller
company unit or investment trust. If you are an experienced, knowledgeable
and sensible investor, smaller company shares are one area where the private
individual is not necessarily at a disadvantage to the professionals.
Many readers may prefer to use a unit or investment trust although, often,
these have done substantially worse than the index. Existing funds and those
with a finite pool of money to manage probably have an edge over new or
expanding ones. Management groups with a traditional emphasis on
stock-picking should also have an advantage.
The consistently highest-performing funds with a three-year track record,
according to Fund Research, are (unit trusts): Hill Samuel UK Emerging Cos;
Thornton UK Smaller Cos, Royal Life UK Emerging Cos; Lazard UK Smaller Cos
Growth; Britannia Life Smaller Cos; (investment trusts): Murray Enterprise;
Aberforth Smaller Cos; Smaller Cos (Abtrust); Throgmorton Trust; and
Moorgate.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: Bond investors let their hearts rule - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the bull cycle in financial assets, between 1990 and 1993, the US
stock market happily trailed along behind a booming bond market. When bond
prices rose, so did share prices. This made sense. Higher bond prices meant
lower long-term interest rates.
Lower rates were both good for the struggling economy, because they cut the
cost of capital for companies and loans for consumers, and good for share
prices, because they made stocks look more attractive relative to
fixed-income securities.
However, now that the bulls have deserted bonds, and long-term interest
rates are speedily rising, the stock market is struggling to unhitch its
wagon from a panicking bond market.
This is not to say that the stock market should ignore the bond market's
decline. Since October, long-term interest rates (as measured by the yield
on the benchmark 30-year government bond) have risen more than 100 basis
points - from just below 5.8 per cent to 6.95 per cent.
Stock market investors are right to be worried by this sharp increase in
rates, because higher rates threaten the economy's health by raising the
cost of borrowing for corporations and consumers. They also make equities
look potentially less attractive compared to other assets. Just as
important, the stock market should be concerned if the bond market's losses
have been prompted by signs of steadily rising inflation. Inflation, as the
economists keep repeating, is the enemy of financial markets.
But - and it is a big 'but' - short- and medium-term interest rates, even
with the recent increases in bond yields, remain low by historical
standards. Also, little evidence exists that the recent growth in US
economic activity has been stoking the inflationary fires. If anything, the
long-term outlook for inflation is surprisingly bright.
Unfortunately, bond market investors are allowing their hearts to rule their
heads. And investors in stocks, rattled by the big increase in long-term
interest rates, are proving equally fickle.
This week, the markets were so shaky that two unsubstantiated rumours about
the Whitewater affair contributed to a sharp, and panicky, decline in bond
prices. First, a Washington DC political newsletter reported congressional
gossip that the body of Vince Foster - the aide to President Clinton who
committed suicide last year - had been moved from an apartment to the
Virginia park where it was later discovered.
Second, a newswire service reported that Hillary Clinton had invested money
in a hedge fund that later benefited from shorting US pharmaceutical stocks.
This report attracted a lot of attention because the president's wife has
been playing a key role in drawing up plans for a reform of the country's
healthcare system, plans that have hit the share prices of big drug
companies.
There was little evidence at the time to back up either story, but the
financial markets are so nervous that both reports, combined with
revelations about the allegedly improper actions of White House staff over
investigations into the Whitewater matter, badly spooked already jumpy bond
market investors. Or, at least, that was what traders were saying on
Thursday, when the 30-year bond fell 1 1/4 points. The sharp drop in bond
prices, inevitably, sparked a sell-off in the stock market.
Amid the smokescreen sent up by the Whitewater affair, the rumours of
skulduggery in the White House, and the growing fears - justified or
otherwise - of returning inflation, there is an important truth. The
financial markets, after three years of unprecedented prosperity, are having
to adjust to a new environment. And that adjustment is proving painful.
At least some of the pain in the stock market is being alleviated by a
continued revival in the mergers and acquisitions business, which has been
keeping share prices in certain key industry sectors - including, banking,
telecommunications and media - buoyant.
This week it was the turn of the defence sector to reap the rewards of a
highly-publicised takeover move. On Monday, Martin Marrietta announced an
agreed Dollars 55-a-share bid for Long Island defence contractor Grumman.
Three days later, Northrop, another defence group, upped the stakes by
offering Dollars 60 per share for Grumman.
The news had a dramatic impact on Grumman's share price which, over six
trading days, climbed 75 per cent. The stock now stands at around Dollars
64, which implies that the market expects the bidding war to escalate. A
month after the furious battle for control of Paramount Communications
ended, the stock market has another contested takeover on its hands.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign  Colonial Investment Trust's share price rose by 40 per cent during
1993, while net assets grew 31 per cent, the company announced this week.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 1.56bn at the end of 1993, after a good
year on world stock markets. The total dividend for the year increased 5 per
cent to 3.52p.
The trust's share price discount to net asset value has lately been at its
narrowest since 1972, partly as a result of the popularity of the savings
scheme F  C introduced 10 years ago, which has provided a steady source of
demand for shares in the trust, and has widened its shareholder base. F  C
now has almost 75,000 shareholders - an increase of 32 per cent during 1993
 -and individual shareholders own 46 per cent of the trust.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: A week of quiet torture in stocks - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market managed this week to do a lot of damage to itself
without making much fuss about it. In contrast to the sound and fury a week
before when stocks ended barely changed, the atmosphere was quiet and
relatively calm but the drop in prices was marked.
Its instruments of torture were mostly foreign, particularly the US and
German bond markets, although stock derivatives also played a role at home.
Any tentative rally in the cash market was aborted by a sell-off in
derivatives.
The week opened on a positive note with a one-day rise in global bond
markets buoying equities. After that it was down hill all the way. The FT-SE
100 finished the week down 86.1 points at 3,191.9.
Economic fundamentals should have been more supportive. In the UK industrial
production accelerated in January, prompting the Central Statistical Office
to raise its trend annual growth rate for production from 2.5 per cent to 3
per cent. On a negative note, though, a widening trade gap hammered shares
yesterday. In Germany, metal workers settled for tiny wage increases and
called off their planned strike. In the US, the Federal Reserve Board's
latest Beige Book of economic conditions said only 'limited price pressures'
were apparent.
But markets continue to be uneasy about the direction of interest rates on
both sides of the Atlantic and about inflation and presidential political
problems in the US.
Investors have found few havens from the volatility of recent weeks. One in
the UK has been convertibles, whether preference shares, loan stock or
Eurobonds convertible into the issuing company's ordinary shares. They offer
better yields and security than ordinary equities but at the expense of some
of the capital growth. They usually underperform a sharply rising stock
market but outperform on the way down. But in a stock market driven by
falling interest rates they have not been performing to historical patterns.
One way to track them is via Kleinwort Benson's index of the 80 largest
convertible issues by UK companies. Last year, the COSI-80 gave a total
return of 25 per cent, nearly identical to that of the Footsie but below the
34.5 per cent of the FTA Long Gilt index.
Since then, convertibles have held up well under the downward pressure on
markets. From the beginning of this year to Thursday's close, the COSI-80,
which has a market capitalisation of some Pounds 14bn, had a total return of
minus 1.1 per cent, while the Footsie's was minus 4.8 per cent and the Long
Gilt index's was minus 6.7 per cent. The convertibles' yield spreads over
gilts have narrowed sharply.
But this outperformance has left convertibles looking over-valued. Moreover,
rising dividends on ordinary stock are making the convertibles look less
attractive. Kleinwort still believes, however, there are some worth buying.
Typically they would be issued by a company with good fundamental prospects
and would offer a superior yield to the ordinary stock. Crucially, they must
be available for only a reasonable premium over the ordinary shares. Two
current examples are British Airways 9.75 per cent 2005 and Tomkins 6.25 per
cent 2013.
Convertibles, admittedly, are instruments for the aficionados. Typical
investors are institutional income funds seeking higher income with security
and some capital gains bonus on underlying stock.
'A retail investor wouldn't know to go for them,' says James Higgins of
Chamberlain de Broe, an independent financial adviser. 'They are a hang-over
from the 1980s when people bought securities for income. Those days are long
gone and people are buying now for capital growth.'
Not that capital growth was on offer in the stock market this week. Even
hefty rises in corporate earnings and dividends failed to underpin equities.
More important than the results were a string of upbeat trading statements.
Most eye-catching was BTR's. The diverse industrial group has enjoyed a
sharp improvement in outlook since its interim comments in September.
Then it said: ' . . . Continental Europe declining very rapidly . . .
evidence that the recovery is translating into significant increases in
corporate profitability is still inconclusive . . . the outlook remains
uncertain for any meaningful upturn in the second half . . .'
This week it said: 'The improvement seen in the US and Australia in the last
quarter of 1993 have been maintained, and in the UK and Continental Europe,
with the exception of Germany, recovery, albeit slow, is beginning to
emerge. BTR enters 1994 with a confident view.' And this was after ending
1993 on a high note with a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a
13.4 per cent increase in dividend.
Yesterday, SG Warburg Securities yesterday its forecasts for corporate
earnings in 1994, using BTR's contrasting statements as examples of the slow
rise in optimism. Before recent reports from 58 large companies, it had
forecast that their 1994 earnings after exceptional items would grow by an
average of 14.2 per cent. After the reports, it upped the forecast to 20.7
per cent.
Overall, this reporting season is turning out close to Warburg's
expectations. Dividend growth has averaged 8 per cent against its pre-season
forecast of 7 per cent. Earnings pre-exceptionals are up 44 per cent against
a forecast 45 per cent.
The trends were borne out by results from many big companies this week.
Highlights included: Barclays and Standard Chartered in banking; RTZ,
Laporte, Portals and British Polythene in minerals, chemicals, papers and
plastics; Lloyds in the retail sector; Hillsdown Holdings and Cadbury
Schweppes in food and drink; Hays and WPP in business services and
advertising; Rolls-Royce and TI Group in engineering.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: RTZ digs deep for its dividend - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, is justly proud that the company has
never cut its dividend. This week the world's biggest mining company
surprised many in the City with an increase in the dividend for 1993 - a
year when base metals prices continued on their well-trodden downward path.
RTZ last year completed a restructuring programme, begun in 1988, which
leaves it wholly focused on mining. While Birkin spoke of the resilience of
the company to adverse market conditions, he also warned that the dividend
increase of 1p to 20.5p 'should be taken as an indicator not of the outlook
for 1994, but of our confidence in the company's potential once recovery is
soundly established.'
Since RTZ began to reorganise, average dollar non-ferrous base metal prices
have fallen 44 per cent, including last year's 15 per cent decline. At the
pre-tax level profits were down from Pounds 521m to Pounds 435m on turnover
up from Pounds 4.6bn to Pounds 4.8bn. But adjusted earnings, which are seen
as a truer reflection of the underlying performance, were ahead by 10 per
cent from Pounds 338m to Pounds 373m.
Birkin, presenting his last results as executive chairman, said the prices
of most metals appeared to have stopped falling. 'However, they are likely
to be volatile for some time because of a combination of renewed investor
interest, possibly erratic supplies, and high inventories.'
RTZ is relying on continuing volume growth and low costs to increase its
profits. In copper it expects benefits this year from a rise in production
at Escondida in Chile, the second biggest copper mine in the world in which
it has a 30 per cent stake, and at Bingham Canyon in the US where a new
smelter will cut costs next year. The mine at Marandoo in Australia should
start producing this autumn increasing RTZ's annual iron ore output from 50m
to 60m tonnes. Total capital expenditure is expected to double from 1993's
Pounds 265m.
Philip Crowson, RTZ's chief economist, underlined the company's caution with
an analysis suggesting that average base metals prices are unlikely to
differ much this year from 1993. In spite of some signs of economic recovery
around the world, there would certainly not be enough of a rise in demand to
reverse the flood of metal into stocks, he said.
The extent of world oversupply of copper and aluminium, the two base metals
that most affect RTZ's performance, is illustrated by yesterday's London
Metal Exchange warehouse stock figures. Aluminium stands at a record
2,589,575 tonnes, and copper at 537,475 tonnes, well off the January peak
but still high.
Most analysts who watch base metals prices agree with Crowson that 1994 is
unlikely to prove exciting. Lawrence Eagles, of futures brokers GNI, is
forecasting 'several lacklustre years' before stocks are drawn down.
Crowson's projection is that prices this year will be liable 'to fluctuate
over a fairly wide range before any clear tends become established'. But
they should not drop back to the lows reached last November.
Since then, prices have risen about 20 per cent. The rise 'was triggered,
and even sustained by investors acting largely on technical analysis of
chart patterns', Crowson said.
Nick Moore, of Ord Minnett, an affiliate of the Jardine Fleming group, says
this is consistent with speculators moving in ahead of evidence of recovery.
He also points out that in the past three peak periods for base metals - in
1974, 1980, and 1988 - prices rose 150 per cent ahead of the low. But the
next peak could be three years away.
Kleinwort Benson last week said that for the first time all 15 prices in its
commodity index were rising at the same time. Leo Doyle, of Kleinwort, says
the index was not designed to say anything about the future direction of
commodity prices. It was an indicator of world economic activity. However,
if the underlying strength of the world economy is improving faster than
other estimates indicate, then base metal stocks could be drawn down faster
than many believe.
Whatever happens in the markets, says Moore, 'RTZ is in a terrific position
if it can make this sort of money in a recession.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: Investors who live on borrowed time - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing with borrowed money is the kind of activity you associate with
hedge funds run by professional traders such as George Soros. No prudent
private investor would do it - would he?
Individual investors, however, are soon to be actively encouraged to trade
on borrowed money. And the people doing the encouraging are the governor of
the Bank of England and the chairman of the London Stock Exchange. Not, of
course, that these guardians of financial rectitude are setting out
deliberately to turn Britain into a nation of speculators. It is just a
by-product of their plans for a re-vamped stock market settlement system.
The Bank's proposals for an electronic system, known as Crest, have the
needs of large institutional investors in mind. Private investors are an
afterthought, at best. And the new system - whatever its overall merits -
will be generally bad for individuals. Their biggest gripe has been that
Crest virtually forces them to put their shares into 'nominee accounts'
which deprive them of some of their traditional shareholders' rights - such
as getting company documents and going to meetings.
Far less attention has been paid to the imminent introduction of margin
trading - investing in the stock market using borrowed money. This has long
been common practice in the US and in futures markets worldwide but, until
now, the UK stock market has worked on a peculiar system. All deals done by
an individual investor within a certain account period, usually a fortnight,
are netted out and settled six working days after the end of that period.
In July, the account system will be replaced by something called rolling
settlement under which each deal will be settled a certain number of days
after the actual bargain is struck - initially 10 but, eventually, five or
even three. There will not be time for investors to settle up within the
deadline. They will have two choices: either they keep substantial funds
with their broker or they open a margin account.
This means either that you put up a certain proportion of the cash you will
need for a share purchase and borrow the rest from your broker, or that you
pledge some of your existing shares to your broker as security against new
purchases - and borrow the rest of the purchase costs.
If, for example, you had a portfolio worth Pounds 50,000, you might be able
to borrow Pounds 25,000 for new purchases. But if the price of your shares
fell, your margin could fall below the agreed level and you would find your
broker making a margin call - in other words, asking you to top up your
deposit.
Here is a lucid exposition of how margin trading can oil the wheels of the
stock market mechanism. 'In the stock market, the buyer of securities on
margin gets full title to his property in an unconditional sale. But he rids
himself of the most grievous burden of ownership - that of putting up the
purchase price - by leaving his securities with his broker as collateral for
the loan that paid for them. The buyer . . . gets the full benefit of any
increase in value - the price of the securities goes up, but the loan that
bought them does not . . .
'The machinery by which Wall Street separates the opportunity to speculate
from the unwanted returns and burdens of ownership is ingenious, precise and
almost beautiful. Banks supply funds to brokers, brokers to customers, and
the collateral goes back to banks in a smooth and all but automatic flow . .
. Margins are effortlessly calculated and watched.'
It all sounds very efficient. But what is a touch worrying is that the
quotation comes from Professor JK Galbraith's classic book, The Great Crash
1929*. It describes in pitiless detail how margin trading eased the wheels
of the Wall Street boom and prepared the way for the bust.
When share prices started to fall, margin calls volleyed forth but, all too
often, went unanswered - because the investors, quite rapidly, ran out of
real money. Wall Street encountered the problem of 'negative equity' long
before British home-owners.
Of course, margin trading does not always have such tragic consequences. The
system flourishes in New York today without spreading routine financial
devastation. But, in the United States, margin requirements are controlled
tightly by the central bank. As yet, both the Bank of England and the London
Stock Exchange seem to be shrugging off all responsibility for margins.
Let us not exaggerate. Reckless trading on margins is likely to be a
minority problem. But it is ironic that the Bank is partly responsible for
introducing a potentially explosive system into this country.
Tax collectors have long ranked with pharisees and sinners as legitimate
popular hate objects. And avoiding paying unnecessary tax is almost a sport
among the investing classes. Early spring is the peak season for this.
Taxation phobia can become dangerous, however, if investors start choosing
investments purely because they are tax-effective. For example, many people
who went into business expansion schemes to enjoy the 40 per cent tax relief
ended up with a worthless investment. Be warned.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Keep out: a frontier state holds the line: A city battles to
repel illegal immigrants. Nicholas Woodsworth joins a border patrol and
reports on the depressing process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine a city on the margins of western Europe - Trieste, Helsinki or
Marseilles, perhaps - perpetually beseiged by hoardes of frantic people.
Victims of social and economic collapse in their own countries to the east
and south, they have little to lose. What stands between them and a better
life is that most tangible of imaginary lines, a border.
They cross the frontier and its defences by any means possible - by small
boat, over fences and roof-tops, through underground drains, in blind mass
charges over empty wasteground. They are so numerous - more than 10,000
every night - that the authorities are overwhelmed. Those who are caught jam
the jails and detention centres and clog the legal system. Those who are not
caught disappear inside illegal immigrant communities, flood job markets and
bring social services to a point of collapse. More and more, Trieste,
Helsinki or Marseilles resembles the desperate, lawless places these
immigrants have left.
Such an inundation might appear far-fetched in western Europe. Apocalyptic
visions of this kind are usually raised by extremist groups concerned with
tightening already-rigorous immigration laws. But in one western city, it is
a reality.
The city is El Paso, in west Texas, on the US-Mexico border, where US
authorities have instituted unprecedented measures to staunch a flow of
illegal immigration. Recently I went riding with the US Border Patrol to see
what Operation Hold-the-Line, and opposition to it, is all about.
I drove into El Paso from the east along the Rio Grande River. As a natural
feature separating two countries the Rio Grande is unimpressive. It is so
narrow and shallow in parts that the name 'wetback', traditionally applied
to illegal Mexican immigrants who swam the river, hardly seemed to apply. On
several isolated stretches near the Santa Elena canyon I was able to wade
back and forth to Mexico without even getting my knees wet.
But the river has an ally in the land that surrounds it: the Chihuahua
Desert forms some of the most inhospitable country on the continent. Only
the most determined and well-organised 'illegals' try to make their way to
American cities on the northern side of this vast, empty tract of scrub and
cactus.
None the less, even here there are foreign nationals - Mexicans for the most
part, but also other Latin Americans and immigrants from as ar away as east
Asia - who make their way across the border with the hired help of Mexican
'coyotes', skilled guides with local knowledge.
Their ruses are many. Illegals have been known to walk backwards for miles
across the desert to confuse their trackers, or even to attach horseshoes to
wooden blocks on their feet. And the stakes can be high. Not long ago a
group of Chinese illegals paid Dollars 30,000 apiece for the privilege of
being smuggled across the Chihuahua desert into the US. They did not make
it.
From time to time as I drove through the desert I came across the highway
check-points and the green and white off-road vehicles of the US Border
Patrol. With slightly more than 4,000 men, the patrol is the first line of
defence against illegal immigration into the US.
El Paso, the patrol headquarters for this section of the frontier, took me
by surprise. It has long ceased to be the romantic cowboy town of western
legend. Today it is a busy military, commercial and industrial centre, the
largest on the frontier between Houston and San Diego. In El Paso I watched
spooky-looking Stealth bombers fly over the city from the runways of Fort
Bliss; got caught in horrific freeway traffic jams on Interstate 10; and
breathed desert air perfumed by a thick brown layer of factory smog. A
graceless, booming, nose-to-the-grindstone sort of place, El Paso was not a
city I found attractive.
But attraction is a relative matter. Directly opposite El Paso, a mere
three-minute walk over the Santa Fe International Bridge, lies the city of
Juarez, the fourth largest in Mexico. Separated by nothing more than a few
feet of shallow and muddy Rio Grande water, two worlds meet head on. One is
wealthy, productive and full of opportunity; the other is poor, corrupt,
underdeveloped and overcrowded. Seen from the other side of the river, El
Paso is a land of plenty.
'Hey, you wanna wake up in time for work?'
I was standing on a broken sidewalk at the bottom of Benito Juarez Avenue in
downtown Juarez, and talking to Frank, who was trying to sell me an alarm
clock. Juarez Avenue runs south from the international bridge. Catering to
the needs and weaknesses of day-tripping American tourists, it is a seedy,
garish street of ill-lit drinking places and souvenir shops, off-track
betting offices and strip joints, taco bars and dance halls. On the sidewalk
you can buy anything from stolen windscreen wipers to young girls. Frank was
hawking cheap watches and alarm clocks from a cardboard tray.
Frank had returned to Juarez after years as an illegal farm worker in
Fresno, California. Life was bad there for illegals, he told me, but the
money was good. He came back because he was falling apart. He was drinking
and smoking too much marijuana, and had become mixed up in hard drugs and
gang life. 'I almost died. Now I live clean, go to church every day, and
sell clocks for people to wake up.'
Frank is an exception. No matter how difficult life may be for Mexican
illegals - they are thought to number millions - few voluntarily return to
the grinding poverty of home. Nor has their presence, in the past at least,
been entirely unwelcome in the US. For decades, American business and
agricultural interests, especially in southern California, encouraged
illegal immigration because cheap Mexican labour meant bigger profits. From
time to time the US government cracked down on illegal immigration, but
there was a tacit acceptance that what was good for business was good for
America, and a blind eye was turned.
Order a meal in a Los Angeles restaurant today and the chances still are
that the salad you eat was grown, transported, prepared and served by
illegal labour. But it is no longer easy to enter the US. American
recession, unemployment, rocketing health and education costs, growing crime
and social problems and sheer weight of numbers has brought a dramatic
hardening of attitude. One of the toughest reactions is Operation
Hold-the-Line.
'We used to cross the river to work in El Paso and come back to Juarez to
sleep,' Frank told me. 'Hell, I knew guys who used to come home for lunch.
Now we have people here from central Mexico, with nothing to eat and nowhere
to stay, sleeping on cardboard and waiting days or weeks for a chance to
sneak over. Most often they don't get it.'
Operation Hold-the-Line, begun last September, was a radical change of
strategy for the El Paso Border Patrol. In the past, the 650 patrol agents
in the sector ran mobile patrols throughout their territory - 160 miles of
border and 125,000 square miles of rough, uninhabited desert frontierland
adjacent to it.
Although the patrol was arresting between 800 and 1,300 Mexicans a day, it
estimated 10 times that number, about 10,000 people a day, were regularly
getting through. The vast majority were crossing through the city itself.
Today El Paso is no longer an open corridor. Hold-the-Line adopts tactics of
permanent concentration where crossings are greatest: there is now one
patrol agent stationed every 400 yards from the Ysleta Spanish Mission on
the border in east El Paso to Sunland Park in the west, a distance of 20
miles. With such a blockade in force 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
illegal crossings are down by 90 per cent.
Originally called Operation Blockade and accompanied by a proposal to build
an impenetrable steel fence between El Paso and Juarez, the strategy
initially brought vigorous protest from the Mexican government, US civil
rights groups and the locally-powerful Catholic church. To some it was a
Berlin Wall. I got in touch with Monsignor Remundo Pena, the Bishop of El
Paso, to find out why Hold-the-Line had caused such a stir.
What, I asked the bishop, who began his career working with illegal Mexican
farm labourers in the lower Rio Grande Valley, was wrong with the border
patrol enforcing the law? Nothing, he replied. What needed looking into was
the law itself.
For the bishop, Hold-the-Line is an historical, economic and political
contradiction. Until last century, El Paso, and much of the south-western
US, was Mexican territory. Today, 70 per cent of the city's US population is
Hispanic. For many in the region, the border is an illogical inconvenience.
Work, too, unites rather than separates El Paso and Juarez. For decades, the
maquiladora, or twin plant system, has linked the cities. More than 70
corporations, including Honeywell, General Motors, Siemens, Toshiba and
Sony, manufacture goods in El Paso but have them cheaply assembled in
Juarez.
Above all, though, it is the alliances of the future that make Hold-the-Line
a non sequitur. With the signing last year of Nafta, the North American Free
Trade Agreement, the two cities on the border have become, in theory at
least, a symbol of a strong new partnership. How, asked the bishop, can you
promote Juarez-El Paso as a single international city of free trade, welcome
your new business partner, but then slam the door on his family? I went out
that evening to see how that exclusion process worked.
In the border patrol processing centre at the foot of the Santa Fe bridge I
watched patrolmen working under bright fluorescent lights. They were
searching newly apprehended illegals, questioning and registering them, and
placing them in holding cells prior to their return to Mexico.
Business was slow. A few teenagers came through, a prostitute, a couple of
children caught shoplifting. But bright light is not the patrolman's natural
element. His real work takes place in the dark of the night, when the vast
majority of illegals take their chances in an obscure, smog-ridden gloom.
'It's not just the Mexican factories that make the smoke,' said patrolman
Mike Moon as we bounced through the dark in a border patrol 4x4. 'People
sleeping rough along the river on the Juarez side get cold  - they burn old
tyres, cardboard, polystyrene boxes, anything they can get hold of. Some
nights it's hard to breathe down here.'
If breathing was difficult down beside the Rio Grande, seeing anything was
more difficult still. Here in the city the river is little more than a
shallow channel of water contained between concrete walls and the border
zone is a dim, half-lit world, an urban no-man's-land of abandoned waste
ground, barricaded no-go streets, empty railway yards, fenced-off
warehouses, chained gates, prohibited access zones and long stretches of
chain-link fences riddled with holes.
It is eerie, and slightly ominous. As we drove along the concrete banks of
the river, at regular intervals we passed parked vehicles in which uniformed
men sat hour after hour, eyes glued to binoculars and infra-red
night-sights, the only sound being the buzz and crackle of two-way radios.
Men sitting by roadside fires, women walking along the highway, boys
loitering in the shadows - nothing on the other side of the river went
unnoticed. After years on the job, Moon told me, patrolmen develop a sixth
sense for who, and who is not, waiting to make a dash over the border.
We drove further. Moon showed me marshalling yards where, prior to
Hold-the-Line, up to 80 Mexicans at a time would rush the border and freight
trains pulling out of El Paso. I saw school grounds where young illegals can
blend into a student population in seconds. Along the river I was shown
places where, during high summer water, boatmen landed their passengers in
the full view of Mexican authorities paid to look the other way. In the Sand
Hills area, where miles of Juarez slums back right on to the border, we
watched trackers set out after a group of illegals who had split up and gone
separate ways.
'Mike, we got a hit,' the radio buzzed a few minutes later. In patrol
parlance, a 'hit' is a signal from one of the thousands of magnetic sensors
concealed along the border. In this case it had come from a railway trestle
bridge spanning the Rio Grande. Already Ferny Melendez, a colleague of
Moon's, was tracking the intruders' passage along the bottom of a narrow
gully on the US side.
Fifteen minutes later Moon and I were waiting in a parking lot where the
gully rose steeply. Melendez had trailed his prey a mile and a half from the
bridge. For these unlucky immigrants, there was no way out except forward.
Our quarry was trapped.
I was expecting some tough hombres - drug runners maybe, or one of the gangs
of men who sometimes turn nasty. In the event, Mike Moon had to help his
catch out of the gully: two mothers, two children, two babies and two young
men in jeans and T-shirts. They did not seem angry or resentful as we
bundled them into the 4x4 for processing and deportation back to Mexico -
just hopeless and bone-weary. They were just six of 157 illegal immigrants
arrested that night.
Could the same situation, the same solution, develop in post-communist
Europe? I hope not. I found the whole process a miserable and depressing
one. But like North America, Europe also has its great contradiction: a
strategic need for economic unity on a continent of vast economic disparity.
Contrasts between east and western Europe are not diminishing, but growing
more acute. El Paso may seem far away, but the immigration dilemmas facing
the city in the desert may not be so far-fetched and remote after all.

FT  12 MAR 94 / The Long View: Taxing the Titanic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like other British financial columnists this spring I am suffering from what
might be called Budget deprivation - the absence of the mad March annual
publicity-grabbing exercise by the chancellor which has been transferred to
November. We are left glumly to ponder how badly demand in the economy will
be affected when the impact of the pre-programmed tax rises begins to be
felt next month.
A talk to the Confedration of British Industry this week by Stephen Dorrell,
one of the junior Treasury ministers, on his review of savings and the flow
of funds through the economy, was not exactly a substitute for a meaty red
dispatch box exercise. Nevertheless there were some fascinating pointers to
the way the Treasury views its functions and how politics and economics
become tangled.
In a thoughtful talk, Dorrell could not resist remarks such as 'savings are
the life blood of the economy'. Well, the political spin is nearly always
that savings are virtuous but consumption is self-indulgent and
shortsighted. The irony is that the Treasury, in its macroeconomic rather
than microeconomic mode, is gambling that a drop in savings next year will
offset the extra taxes it is loading on the economy.
If consumers insist on tightening their belts, rather than raiding their
piggy banks, the growth rate of the economy will falter, the higher tax
revenues forecast for 1994-95 will fail to materialise, and interest rates
may have to go up to maintain confidence in sterling and in the government's
ability to finance its deficit smoothly.
The idea that savings might be not so much the life blood as the cholesterol
of the economy was a foundation of Keynesian theories in the 1920s and
1930s. The private sector might decide to save too much to maintain full
employment. If there were too many misers their depressing influence might
need to be offset by some public sector spendthrifts. Spend now, tax later.
Trouble was, politicians tended to forget the second part of the formula, or
at any rate they replaced it with the modified version 'inflate later'.
The private sector of the economy has been saving on a massive scale
recently, in an attempt to reduce the debt burden it acquired in the late
1980s. The personal sector has been in massive financial surplus for a
couple of years now, and the company sector turned itself around during
1993, so that in the third quarter of last year the combined private sector
surplus was running at about 6 per cent of gdp. The public sector was forced
to dissave in order to prevent an economic collapse; hence the nervousness
about its efforts to pass part of the parcel back again by reducing the
deficit.
The personal savings ratio jumped from 7.2 per cent in 1989 to 12.6 per cent
in 1992, and it is generally forecast to fall back below 10 per cent by next
year. At this level it would be slightly below the international norm, but
well above the notoriously low US figure of about 4 per cent (although the
definitions vary).
Of course, politicians do not say that people should save less. They do not
eliminate tax shelters such as Peps, and indeed there is some logic in that
because these are long-term incentives and should not be imperilled by
temporary problems. Cutting short-term interest rates is the most common and
effective means of hitting savings. Again, this is not expressed directly,
and other reasons for changes tend to be given. Relative to the inflation
rate, however, short-term interest rates are not particularly low and,
ironically, the cut in mortgage interest relief coming next month will have
the opposite effect of discouraging borrowing and thus of boosting the
saving ratio.
But, although saving remains comparatively high, the really odd thing about
the British economy is that consumption is high too. We are living beyond
our means as a nation, with an external current account deficit of Pounds
10bn or more. Government consumption is offsetting private sector frugality.
The way back to external balance is through more saving and investment. But
that would cause a collapse in government revenues. Stand by for a tricky
balancing act.
The Dorrell review, however, appears to be mainly about the microeconomic
aspects of savings and investment flows: whether pension funds are too
greedy for dividends, for instance, or whether clearing banks are too
obsessed by the availability of collateral when financing small companies.
Perhaps the government is struggling to develop some kind of philosophy,
after Norman Lamont suddenly imposed what amounted to an extra tax on
company dividends in the final spring Budget 12 months ago. The reasoning
behind that has never been explained, except to the extent that the move
raised a significant amount of new tax revenue.
There may be an attempt to dump some Thatcherite baggage. The Thatcher
government originally had some clear dogmatic objectives, such as levelling
various playing-fields including those relating to the taxes on dividends
and debt and the taxes on personal income and capital gains. Market forces
were to be supreme. But eventually the clarity became buried beneath an
accretion of Peps, Tessas and Business Expansion Schemes.
Stephen Dorrell appeared to offer little in the way of principles, just a
series of questions about whether maybe the UK should seek to channel
resources to a British recreation of the German Mittelstand, or medium-sized
manufacturers, and whether British companies pay out too much in dividends.
Was that the reason, perhaps, for the dividend tax changes a year ago?
But we are going over some very old ground, albeit beloved by meddlesome
politicians. Changing the tax allowances on the Titanic will not provide
much protection against icebergs, or even medium-sized U-boats. Enough of
reviews, roll on the next Budget.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Testing time for wind farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wind energy industry has been warned it must overcome objections that
wind farms are noisy and spoil the landscape if it wants government
subsidies.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday that if the industry was
to develop 'it must find sites which are acceptable to the planning
process'.
In the past, the government has stressed the environmental benefits of wind
power while playing down criticisms of their noise and visual impact.
Mr Eggar also said wind farms would only get financial support if there was
a prospect that they would produce electricity at market prices. Like most
renewable forms of energy, wind power is several times more expensive than
conventional sources.
Mr Eggar's comments came as the Department of Trade and Industry released
details of applications for the latest round of the non-fossil fuel
obligation, the scheme to subsidise renewable energy projects. Of the 650
applications for financial help - including small-scale hydroelectric
schemes, and heat from waste and tidal power projects - some 230 were wind
farms. However Mr Eggar doubted that more than 20 wind farms would be
approved for subsidy.
'This will depend on developers' abilities to find sufficient windy sites
which are acceptable in planning terms,' he said. Successful bidders will be
announced at the end of this year.
Mr Joseph Lythgoe, a leading anti-wind farm campaigner, said Mr Eggar
appeared to be 'trimming his sails', although 20 new wind farms would treble
the number already in operation.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, accused Mr Eggar of imposing
'an arbitrary limit' on wind farms before the local planning process had
assessed individual projects.
Dr Ian Mays, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association, said
competition would ensure that only the most cost effective and
environmentally acceptable projects went ahead.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Poland in deal with banks to cut debt
</HEADLINE>

Poland and its London Club commercial bank creditors yesterday signed an
agreement in principle for the reduction and rescheduling of Poland's
Dollars 13.2bn (Pounds 9bn) private sector debt, allowing the country to
return to the international capital markets.
Details of the agreement, reached after four years of negotiations, will
probably take until September to finalise. It was signed in Frankfurt
between Dresdner Bank, representing more than 300 foreign bank creditors,
and Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, Poland's foreign debt negotiator. The debt
reduction will cost the banks about 42.5 per cent of their outstanding loans
and unpaid interest, according to Dresdner Bank, which has led the London
Club talks. The exact figure will depend on the mix of repayment methods
chosen by creditors from options established by the agreement.
The reduction is well below the 50 per cent write-off sought by Poland as
required by the terms of its April 1991 Paris Club agreement with government
creditors.
The Paris Club agreed a two-stage, 50 per cent reduction in Poland's Dollars
33bn official debt, contingent on Poland's compliance with strict
International Monetary Fund budgetary targets. It obliged Poland to seek
similar terms from its bank creditors. Poland faces annual debt servicing
charges of about Dollars 4.5bn by 2005 under the Paris Club deal.
The commercial banks refused to consider themselves bound by the Paris Club
terms and insisted that Poland could pay more.
In recognition of Poland's short-term budgetary restraints, however, the
London Club agreement is graduated with higher repayments in later years.
The deal will cost Warsaw Dollars 400m a year on average over the first five
years of a 30-year repayment period, Dollars 520m a year over the first 10
years and Dollars 600m a year over the first 15 years. Poland will offer to
repurchase part of its Dollars 9.3bn principal debt and Dollars 3.8bn
overdue interest at a price to be announced by Warsaw.
Mr Krowacki said the agreement, which will cost Poland an estimated Dollars
1.3bn in 1994, signifies the normalisation of the country's financial
relations. 'Without such an agreement, Poland would have had to renegotiate
its Paris Club agreement and that would have been suicidal,' he said.
The World Bank has set aside Dollars 500m to help Poland finance the deal.
The IMF has agreed to provide Dollars 300m. This leaves Dollars 500m to be
financed this year from Poland's official and banking system reserves, which
currently stand at about Dollars 7.6bn.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Army joins 'homeland' battle: S Africa troops act to restore
order in Bophuthatswana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   MMABATHO, BOPHUTHATSWANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African army last night moved in to the black 'homeland' of
Bophuthatswana, chasing out rightwing whites who had taken control of the
capital Mmabatho, in a drive to restore order after looting and fierce
fighting left at least 60 dead.
Power changed hands several times between the Bophuthatswana Defence Force,
the South African Defence Force and thousands of paramilitary rightwing
whites who had taken control of the capital Mmabatho and its twin town,
Mafikeng. But by early this morning the South African Defence Force appeared
to have the homeland largely under control.
Among those killed in yesterday's fighting were two rightwing whites
executed by a Bophuthatswana soldier as they begged for mercy.
South African government officials said the defence force had been deployed
in strength to take control after local police and soldiers joined a popular
revolt against President Lucas Mangope who said he wanted Bophuthatswana to
remain as a separate state and refused to participate in South Africa's
first all race election in April.
Last night South African officials said Mr Mangope might be allowed to
remain titular head of state, but the homeland would in effect come under
martial rule from Pretoria.
At first only 150 troops were deployed but government officials said later
1,500 troops were being sent in with a large back-up force to remain nearby.
A foreign ministry official said 57 bodies were reported at Victoria
Hospital in Mmabatho and 10 bodies elsewhere after two days of looting and
bitter fighting.
Yesterday's events represented a humiliating defeat for the right wing,
which had sent thousands of supporters to shore up Mr Mangope's failing
regime, and a victory for the ANC, which has achieved its goal of ensuring
Bophuthatswana will be reincorporated into South Africa and that its 2m
citizens can participate in next month's elections.
Mr Mangope's status remained unresolved last night, with the chairman of the
Independent Electoral Commission, which is supervising the conduct of the
poll, flying to Mmabatho to insist on guarantees from him that
Bophuthatswana will participate in the poll.
Earlier, Mr Mangope issued a statement saying he had registered a political
party, the Northwest Christian Democrat party, to contest the elections but
government officials said this statement did not go far enough to satisfy
Pretoria and the ANC on election participation.
Late yesterday afternoon, South African President FW de Klerk met Mr Nelson
Mandela, leader of the ANC, to decide the fate of President Mangope after
the police and army revolted against his rule. Mr Mandela has urged joint
administration of the homeland, through the Transitional Executive Council,
the body which oversees government in the run up to elections.
As dusk fell three black bodies lay in the main street of Mafikeng,
apparently shot by whites, while South African armoured personnel carriers
escorted whites beyond the border into South Africa. Villagers cheered as
the South Africa troops chased the rightwing whites out.
Earlier, outside the headquarters of the Bophuthatswana police, three whites
were killed after a group in trucks being chased by Bophuthatswana Defence
Force soldiers opened fire on black bystanders, provoking a gun battle.
Three men were wounded. As they fell from their vehicle, one was shot
immediately, and two others lay on the ground, begging for mercy before a
Bophuthatswana soldier shot them dead.

FT  12 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market is growing jittery about Eurotunnel. The units fell 5 per cent
yesterday on a French media report suggesting the Channel tunnel would not
be open for the critical summer season. Eurotunnel was unable to issue a
convincing denial. That is probably because it has no firm idea when it will
open. Delays in delivering rolling stock and commissioning operating systems
are proving troublesome.
Eurotunnel is surely right to postpone the phased openings until its train
sets are working smoothly. It would do immense damage to its reputation to
open prematurely and offer a poor service. That, though, will only intensify
the headaches in its finance department. Eurotunnel has said it will run out
of cash in May which is why it needs to raise Pounds 1bn in fresh debt and
equity. But no merchant banker will sign off a rights issue prospectus
before the opening dates are fixed and revenue projections can be made with
the minimum uncertainty.
Eurotunnel says the prospectus will be published before June but not
necessarily before the official state opening on May 6. That raises the
possibility of a further slippage in the fund raising's timing. Eurotunnel
should have little difficulty arranging stand-by facilities with its bankers
should the cash run out in the meantime. There is little alternative use for
such a big hole in the ground. But the delay can only worsen the terms under
which the rights issue is staged.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, this week's decision by Whitbread to sell its regional
brewing stakes suggests an inclination to expand more in leisure than
brewing. In fact its strategic options are about as open as before. All that
can be said for certain is that Whitbread will not use the stakes acquired
from Whitbread Investment Co last year to make full bids for the regional
brewers. The most obvious explanation is that Whitbread does not want to
acquire new estates of varying quality when that would require offsetting
sales of pubs under the government's competition rules.
Indeed the rules make it so complicated for big brewers to buy small ones
that the strategic imperative must be considerable to make it worthwhile.
Consolidation may yet come, though, as a result of regional brewers buying
each other. Once the Whitbread sale has been absorbed, selective bid
premiums could appear in their shares. Unlike the big brewers, the regionals
have scope to expand their pub estates. That would lessen their dependence
on a particular regional economy, add efficiency to food operations and give
them the clout to negotiate larger discounts from outside beer suppliers.
There may be less room for brewing. Even large regionals lack the scale to
develop their brands nationally - which is why opportunities may yet arise
for Whitbread in brewing. It has shown with Boddington what it can do with a
regional beer brand while its original owner concentrated on retailing. All
it needed to begin with was the brewery and the brand, not the pubs.

FT  12 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Grumman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharks are circling closer in the US defence business. Despite a 40 per
cent fall in military hardware spending from the peak six years ago, most
consolidation deals in the US industry have been reasonably friendly asset
swaps. Now the possibilities for partnerships are narrowing, and the
potential losers are threatening to turn nasty - hence the struggle for
control of Grumman between Martin Marietta and Northrop.
In aircraft, Grumman has seen production of its A-6 and F-14 carrier-based
bombers and interceptors ended. Northrop is also suffering from cuts in the
B-2 stealth bomber programme. Yet both companies have continuing
aero-structures work, Grumman with the E2-C early-warning aircraft and F-14
refurbishment, Northrop with the F-18 fighter and the Boeing 747. There is
thus logic in consolidating the businesses. Martin Marietta also has a
claim, however. Its strong connections to the US army and its electronics
and space surveillance expertise would complement Grumman's electronics
manufacturing, spy-plane technology and naval links.
The risk is that in an effort to retain position, both Martin and Northrop
may overpay for Grumman. With manufacturing sites spread widely around the
US, rationalisation costs will be heavy for either bidder. There is also the
outside chance of competition difficulties with the Federal Trade
Commission. President Clinton has said there will be no further cuts in
military budgets, but there is no guarantee a leaner industry will leave
shareholders with much to cheer about.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's trade figures provided a wonderful excuse for more outpourings
of gloom on the UK economy. The markets' predictable conclusion was that
even this modest recovery is exacting a terrible price on the trade account.
As the deficit is deteriorating more quickly than many expected, the
authorities may be forced sooner into corrective action. At the very least,
the weaker tone of sterling may make them more reluctant to cut interest
rates. That has nasty implications for gilts which promptly fell 1.5 points
with equities following down behind.
There is a danger, though, that the markets will become too fixated on the
bad news. True, the trade deficit remained disturbingly high throughout the
recession. True, also, the 11 per cent increase in export unit prices over
the past year suggests UK industry is still prepared to sacrifice long-term
market share for short-term margins. But the worst part of the deterioration
was in exports to continental Europe in the closing couple of months of last
year when sterling was rising towards DM2.60.
The currency has now fallen back closer to DM2.50, while at some stage
European interest rates must fall to the point where recovery sets in,
allowing the UK scope to continue growing. By then, yesterday's market
reaction may be seen as a buying opportunity, especially in gilts which now
offer a full percentage point yield premium to German bunds. A couple of
months of good inflation figures would make present yields look attractive,
which might permit the government to fund aggressively again.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow gains from late bond
price rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a mixed morning, the US stock market ended a fractious week firmly
higher, thanks primarily to a late rally in bond prices, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.08 at 3,862.70, its
high for the day. The more broadly based Standard  Poor's 500 ended up 2.54
at 466.44, while the American Stock Exchange finished up 1.20 at 465.98.
The Nasdaq composite fared less well, and closed only 0.11 higher at 789.20.
Trading volume was 303m shares.
After Thursday's frenetic trading in bonds and stocks, much of it prompted
by unsubstantiated rumours concerning the White House and the Whitewater
affair, some semblance of calm returned to financial markets yesterday.
Share prices, however, opened lower after an early rally in the bond market
had fizzled out. That rally in bonds had been inspired by a February retail
sales report. Although the figures showed a bigger than expected increase of
1.5 per cent in February sales, bond market investors and traders chose to
concentrate instead on a surprise, and sharp, downward revision in the
January data. If the two months were taken together, analysts said, sales
were essentially flat in early 1994, which was good news for
inflation-sensitive bonds.
Yet the bond market could not hold on to its early gains, which disturbed
equity investors. Consequently, stocks fell across the board in the first
hour of trading.
However, the market later rallied convincingly off its lows, and again it
was bond prices which provided the lead. Bonds, having fallen to opening
values mid-morning, revived later, and by late afternoon the benchmark
30-year government bond was up three quarters of a point, and the yield was
down to 6.909 per cent.
The rally inspired the stock market, and aided by short-covering, blue-chip
stocks steadily recovered during a busy afternoon of buying.
Among individual issues, Grumman jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in
volume of 2m shares after a second rival defence group, Northrop, offered to
buy the company. Northrop's offer of Dollars 60 a share tops an earlier,
agreed, bid from Martin Marrietta worth Dollars 55 a share.
The rise in Grumman's stock yesterday implies that the market expects the
bidding war to escalate well beyond Dollars 60 a share. The news left
Northrop up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 3/8 and Martin Marrietta off Dollars
2 at Dollars 44 1/2 .
Unisys climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 15 3/4 , lifted by news of a Dollars
127m banking automation contract awarded to the company and a ratings
upgrade from brokerage house Lehman Brothers.
International Paper, hit earlier in the week by a profits warning, rebounded
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 after Paine Webber upgraded its rating on the
stock from 'neutral' to 'buy'.
Canada
Toronto shares ended little changed in active trading.
The composite index was up 3.68 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 4446.86, for a
gain on the week of about 48 points.
In Friday's trading, declines led advances by 376 to 371, volume of 94.959
shares was below Thursday's 100.444 shares, and trading value fell to
CDollars 823m from CDollars 917.5m.
Most gains were limited. Industrial products gained 0.61 per cent, consumer
products and energy were flat, and mining, financial services, and golds
were down slightly.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany offers detachment from
US woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses suffered again from nervousness over falling US stock and bond
prices, but there was belated evidence that Germany could offer a degree of
detachment, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended Thursday's post bourse losses, ending with the Dax index
37.61 down on the session and 21.02 lower than its overnight close at
2,103.49. Turnover fell from DM9bn to DM8.2bn.
However, there were two points of encouragement. The offical close was 2.1
per cent higher on the week; and the Ibis indicated Dax held up well in the
afternoon, closing at 2,101.89 although Wall Street had another weak
morning.
Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that as the IG Metall
wage settlement boosted German equities on Monday, yesterday's agreement
with the public workers' union, OeTV, gave equities some support after
hours.
Viag, as expected, was not popular. The terms of Thursday's deal to buy
Bayernwerk from the Bavarian government left the shares DM31.50, or 6.4 per
cent lower at DM458.50.
MILAN was led higher by telecoms as the Comit index added 1.52 to 665.26 for
a 1.9 per cent rise over the week. The mood, however, remained restrained
ahead of elections at the end of the month and the end of the account next
week.
Sip added L171 or 2.9 per cent to L4,534, for a two-day rise of 8.4 per
cent, after news that the government will reduce its license fee to
compensate for its loss of the mobile telephone monopoly. Stet added L89 to
L4,906 and Italcable L174 to L10,716, on news that the telecoms companies
are to meet next Saturday to decide on conversion rates for their shares
ahead of the privatisation of the sector.
Parmalat shed L96 or 3.9 per cent to L2,352 as plans to raise up to L500bn
in bonds over the next five years raised worries that the company might be
trying to grow too fast.
PARIS balanced rights and convertible issue news against a slight cut in
overnight rates and came out with the CAC-40 index down 9.67 at 2,174.91 for
a fractional decline on the week. Turnover was FFr4bn.
Dealers pounced on Paribas after its rights issue news, and the shares lost
FFr14.10 at FFr491.90. Eurotunnel fared even worse, down FFr3, or nearly 6
per cent at FFr48 on reports that its passenger service might not open until
after the summer holiday season.
Elsewhere, Michelin fell FFr8.40 to FFr251 on US selling and TF1, the TV
channel, by FFr16.50 to FFr498.50 after a big block trade.
ZURICH lost 1 per cent, the SMI index falling 29.6 to 2,831.6 for a 1.2 per
cent drop on the week.
Banks saw further foreign selling. SBC shed SFr11 to SFr424 and UBS bearers
were SFr14 down at SFr1,230.4.
Cyclicals, however, continued to find favour with Brown Boveri another SFr8
higher at SFr1,179, in further response to Thursday's results. Sulzer added
SFr19 to a year's high of SFr1,039.
Nestle shed SFr16 to SFr1,247: Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock, saying
that the discount of the shares to equivalent international issues had been
eliminated as the stock had significantly outperformed the S  P food index.
AMSTERDAM combined the weakening dollar and falling bonds in a downbeat mood
that sent the AEX sliding 4.67 to 417.63, an improvement of 0.8 per cent
over the week.
But there was also a feeling that the market is poised for an upswing on
strong corporate results. Heineken, which pleased the market after the close
of trading on Thursday, bounced Fl 3.20 to Fl 232.50.
STOCKHOLM was knocked by higher debt market yields at home and lower
equities abroad. The Affarsvarlden General Index slid 22.7 to 1501.6, a fall
of 0.7 per cent on the week.
Ericsson B moved the index with a fall in of SKr16 to SKr343. The decline
continued in early Wall St trading.
Volvo B fell SKr14 to SKr669 over doubts on its cross ownership deal with
Renault.
OSLO fell 1.5 per cent as Norsk Hydro unexpectedly unveiled a rights issue
to raise up to NKr5bn. The all-share index fell 9.88 to 654.97 in active
turnover of NKr653m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr11 to NKr243 although the minority
Labour government said that it planned to maintain its 51 per cent stake and
participate in the issue.
ISTANBUL was boosted by a flurry of buying in a market that had fallen 12
per cent in the previous four days. The bargain hunting pushed up the
composite index up 779.92 to 14,511.25, a fall of 6.9 per cent on the week.
But bearish feeling remained with some dealers feeling that the surge was
premature. Most of the buying interest centred on sectors unlikely to be
affected by currency fluctuations.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Madrid to broaden its base with new
listings - Brokers see a profitable 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You might excuse Spaniards for thinking that their stock markets were out of
touch with the real world.
The news has been of record unemployment, almost 24 per cent according to
the last quarterly survey and expected to rise; inflation edging up to 5 per
cent; a worrying growth in the public sector deficit; and a crisis in one of
the traditional pillars of the banking system. All this, apparently, has had
little impact on equity trends.
Last year, the Spanish economy shrank by 1 per cent, its worst performance
for 30 years, but stocks on the Madrid market increased in value by 50.7 per
cent, beating the main world markets including Frankfurt. In January, in the
aftermath of the Spanish authorities' dramatic intervention in Banco Espanol
de Credito (Banesto), the market rallied with an 11 per cent rise. The
December 1985-based general index scored an all-time high of 358.57.
Since then it has fallen back, but the level of about 335 around which it
has fluctuated in the past few days is still higher than the index attained
in 1993.
The market started last year, however, at a point analysts consider to have
been unrealistically low, with high interest rates detracting from the
relative attractiveness of equity investments. Recent increases in stock
prices have been closely linked to expectations of lower interest levels.
Bond rates, after an erratic period, have come down. And last week the Bank
of Spain unexpectedly cut its official benchmark interest rate by a full
half-point to 8 per cent.
Madrid's Bolsa is also strongly influenced by trends in other European
markets, especially Paris and Frankfurt. It is one of the few markets which
did not touch new highs in the preceding months. Until January, the record
for the general index had stood for over four years at 328.55.
In an atmosphere of cautious optimism about economic improvement, at least
in terms of a lower annual inflation rate later in the year and a
restoration of modest economic growth, some brokers forecast that the market
could brush the 400 level by the end of this year. Mr Paul Farrow of Ahorro
Corporacion predicts 380, although he believes that it could fall back in
the interim to about 320. He expects some Pta900bn (Dollars 6.6bn) of new
money to flow into the market through the growth of equity unit trusts.
Currently 2 per cent or less of Spanish mutual fund investments are in
equities, but Mr Farrow believes that this will expand to 8 per cent in 1994
because of the fall in interest rates.
Another leading broker, FG Inversiones Bursatiles, is more conservative,
forecasting about 365 for the year-end. But Mrs Monica Morales of Societe
Generale Valores says: 'The received wisdom is that it will go up by about
20 per cent.'
Subscriptions close today for the first big share offering of the year, in
which 15 per cent of the Continente supermarket group, controlled by
Promodes, is being brought to the market, where it will immediately join the
Ibex-35 group of blue-chip stocks. In the footsteps of the Carrefour
subsidiary, Pryca, it is the first significant entry by a private-sector
company for more than two years.
A series of other placings will follow. These include some Dollars 104m
worth of shares in the Aumar motorway company currently held by Banco
Central Hispano and around Dollars 300m worth in the privately-controlled
FCC construction concern - the latter the largest-ever operation of its kind
in the private sector.
A 10 per cent slice of Endesa, the state-controlled electricity generator,
is due to be placed by early June, worth some Dollars 1.4bn. Part of this
stake may, however, go to a European 'strategic partner'. A further 20 per
cent of Repsol, the partly-privatised oil group, is expected to be offered
for sale in the second half.
Cortefiel, a family-controlled retailer, is thought likely to come on to the
market in the coming months. The government is also expected to sell off its
24 per cent direct holding in Telefonica Internacional, the
foreign-operation subsidiary of Telefonica, the state-majority
telecommunications group.
The market remains a narrow one, however, with the vast bulk of trading
concentrated in 25 to 30 large companies, principally banks and utilities.
Banks have been particularly active in the wake of the crisis at Banesto,
for which a rescue package is being put together under the auspices of the
Bank of Spain. Another of Spain's leading institutions in the sector,
Central Hispano, has recently come under selling pressure after Moody's
announced that it was reviewing its ratings for the bank's certificates of
deposit.
However, Banesto, which faces a shareholders' meeting two weeks from today
to approve the rescue plan, is regarded as an isolated case. Its misfortunes
appear to have done little damage to market confidence.
The difficulties at the bank were widely known about by the time the crisis
came to a head in late December, and most foreign institutional investors
were already giving the stock a wide berth. 'If something similar were to
happen to another bank it would be very serious,' says one analyst. But as
long as it goes no further than Banesto, the market has shown itself able to
take the crisis in its stride.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei steady in
cautious region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares recouped morning losses caused by technical selling linked to the
March futures and options settlements and the Nikkei average closed
marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index closed up 24.60 to 20,115.31, or 0.7 per cent higher on
the week, after fluctuating between 20,256.23 and a low of 20,017.10. The
index also met selling by investment trusts in response to the yen's rise
against the dollar, but gained ground in the afternoon thanks to foreigner
buying.
Volume swelled on transactions linked to the futures and options
settlements, totaling 750m shares against 426m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 3.39 to 1,619.90, while the Nikkei 300 added 0.15 to
298.42. Gains outnumbered losses by 609 to 422, with 158 issues remaining
unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei index rose 24.60 to 20,115.31.
Foreign investors supported blue chip shares while some individuals dabbled
in speculative favourites. Hitachi rose Y3 to Y930, Toshiba gained Y10 to
Y780 while Sanyo Electric rose Y13 to Y497.
Aids related issues were higher on reports that Japan Energy, a mining
development and petroleum refining company, will launch clinical tests in
the US for an anti-Aids treatment it has developed. The issue jumped Y18 to
Y438 while investors sought other stocks linked to the 'Aids theme' such as
Sankyo, which rose Y50 to Y2,530 and Tsumura which advanced Y60 to Y1,760.
Mining stocks were bought as gold prices rose. Sumitomo Metal Mining added
Y29 to Y920.
Profit-taking depressed Nitsuko, a telecom parts maker, Y30 to Y1,620 while
NEC declined Y10 to Y1,030 and Fujitsu lost Y10 to Y1,020.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 69.26 to 22,097.59 in spite of selling by
corporate investors, with 103m shares changing hands.
Roundup
Regional markets remained cautious although some bargain hunting was seen.
HONG KONG was uneasy about the outlook for US interest rates and prospects
for the Chinese economy. The Hang Seng index, registered a 223.39 fall
taking it below 10,000 at 9,905.66, little changed on the week.
Attention was also focused on index futures which closed at a slight
discount to cash.
Cathay Pacific fell 40 cents to HKDollars 12.10 after announcing a fall in
its profits of 23.8 per cent. HSBC eased HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 102.
Jardine Matheson managed to swim agains the tide and added 50 cents to
HKDollars 63.
AUSTRALIA was weaker in line with the futures market. The All Ordinaries
index fell 2 to 2,153.1, for a weekly rise of 1.7 per cent, with a public
holiday on Monday limiting the potential for any advance.
SINGAPORE saw a lacklustre day, the Straits Times Industrial index losing 4
to 2,190.10, for a cumulative 2.6 per cent decline on the week. Against the
trend Genting rose 50 cents to SDollars 16.80 and Bukit Sem put on 30 cents
to Dollars S25.00.
MANILA saw some confidence returning as bargain hunters appeared on
expectations of further gains.
The composite index rose 0.94 to 2,553.78, but 2 per cent lower over the
week. The buying interest was boosted by a rally in mining issues after gold
rose sharply in New York.
BOMBAY fell further toward the close as speculators squared up forward
positions on the last day of trading before the March 12 deadline to wipe
out such positions, brokers said.
The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share national index ended 60.50 points lower
at 3,747.22.
KUALA LUMPA rebounded on interest in secondline stocks and the composite
index edged up 0.48 to 1,046.48, but was 1.7 per cent lower on the week.
TAIWAN stocks reversed slight early gains to close lower on a late wave of
selling focused on the pulp and paper and textile sectors. The weighted
index ended 38.46 down at 5,327.57, this year's lowest finish, and a 6.1 per
cent decline on the week.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 3,200 lost as bond weakness
hits shares - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected setback in UK government bonds undermined the stock market
yesterday, driving the FT-SE Index down 42 points as it abandoned the 3,200
mark in equity trading described as brisk, but by no means heavy. London
suffered more seriously than other European markets from the backwash of
Thursday's setback in US bonds.
A weakening in sterling against the German mark, attributed both to
disappointment with the widening of the UK trade deficit in December, and
with the cross current from the dollar's fall, posed a threat to the stock
market's hopes for a base rate cut. Equity strategists read the trade
figures as indicating that export growth might be faltering, although some
perceived this as a buttress to interest rate optimism.
Equities opened lower and gave further ground as selling of stock index
futures developed ahead of the expiry next week of the March contract on the
FT-SE Index. The pace of the setback increased sharply in late afternoon,
when the equity trading account drew to its close. Although both Wall Street
and the New York bond market performed steadily following publication of the
US retail sales data for last month, UK gilts plunged through important
support levels.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,191.9, with virtually no sign
of recovery. The Index has fallen by 86.1 points this week for a total loss
of 2.7 per cent over the two week trading account.
Share prices had tried at the beginning of the week to disengage from the
slide in bonds but yesterday's performance indicates that bond markets
continue to rule equities. The big pension funds, and similar income seeking
institutional investors, are still restructuring portfolios in the light of
the rise in bond yields over the past three weeks.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 51 points to 3,857.4, although traders said
that prices for these second line stocks had simply been marked down with
the blue chips, and had seen little selling.
Seaq trading volume of 776.3m shares was well short of the previous session.
Thursday's 901.9m shares returned a retail worth of Pounds 2.12bn, at the
top end of this year's daily averages.
The setback in share prices was evenly spread, with hardly any sectors
escaping the pressure. Some banking stocks were hit hard, in spite of the
market's favourable response to the sector's dividend prospects. But so also
were many of the leading industrial stocks.
However, analysts sounded relatively undismayed by the sudden downturn.
Longer term views remained faily sanguine with higher dividends and earnings
expected to continue helping a market where interest rate hopes have become
more subdued. This week has brought a number of good profits and dividend
statements, with BTR and Rolls-Royce standing out well.
But there was disappointment with the reaction by UK equities and bonds to a
fairly mild day for economic news. Next week brings more serious tests for
investor sentiment in the form of producer prices, retail sales and public
sector borrowing data on the UK economy.
With global markets still highly sensitive to the chances of a tightening in
credit policy by the US Federal Reserve, markets will also be challenged
next week by producer and consumer pricing statistics from Washington.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Footsie futures fell sharply and dragged the cash market down on the last
day of the equity trading account, writes Clare Gascoigne.
A sustained fall in UK government bonds saw the FT-SE 100 contract for March
expiry hit a low of 3,165 in the afternoon. Technical factors were blamed
for much of the weakness and a late rally saw the contract hit 3,171 by the
official close. Turnover was heavier than usual with just under 20,000
contracts dealt.
In traded options, volume rose to 56,834 contracts. Barclays was the most
active stock option, trading 4,257.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An upbeat note from Hoare Govett helped Thorn EMI stay in positive
territory, the shares edging forward 3 to 1118p. The broker said that the
potential recovery upside in the music industry, rising margins in the US
record market and Thorn's position as software supplier in the unfolding
multimedia revolution all warranted further investor exposure to the stock.
Leisure analyst Mr Hamish Dickson added: 'Thorn shares still trade at
substantial discounts to their peers in the media/entertainment sector. But
as this is increasingly viewed in global terms, we believe Thorn's rating
will rise to eliminate this anomaly.'
Fresh downward pressure on index-linked gilts triggered further selling of
the 'recs' which showed Eastern 11 1/2 off at 613 1/2 p and Southern 20
lower at 615p.
Severn Trent, given a midweek boost by Credit Lyonnais Laing, was the most
resilient of the water stocks, closing 2 firmer at 556p.
A general restructuring of gilt yields also increased the pressure on the
equity market's other high-yielding stocks, such as BT. The latter dropped
13 to 412 1/2 p on turnover of 8.1m. British Gas fell 5 to 301p.
Enterprise Oil fell 10 to 411p on further consideration of the preliminary
results, but BP held up well to close only a fraction easier at 351p on
turnover of 10m shares.
Lloyds Bank suffered from bouts of profit-taking, closing 14 off at 564p as
did Royal Bank of Scotland, 16 weaker at 428p while the hefty losses on the
Hong Kong market kept the pressure on Standard Chartered, 9 lower at 1113p
and HSBC, 26 off at 833p.
Willis Corroon's excellent figures continued to sustain the shares which ran
up 4 more to 227p. Disappointment over figures from advertising agency
Abbott Mead Vickers saw the shares fall 22 to 708p. The group announced a
1993 profit of Pounds 4.75m, up 0.6 per cent, and said it was confident
about future prospects.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel fell 29 to 561p in London and slumped 3.6
per cent in Paris after press reports raised concerns about the starting
date for the passenger service. Eurotunnel said a French newspaper report
that the service might not start before the autumn was 'pure speculation'
and no opening date had been fixed. After the market closed Eurotunnel said
the state opening of the tunnel would take place on May 6 but it declined to
elaborate on passenger traffic timing.
Textiles group Coats Viyella improved 4 to 266p ahead of results on
Wednesday. The market is expecting profits of between Pounds 143m and Pounds
150m, up from Pounds 109.1m in 1992.
Positive recommendations from two securities houses failed to prevent
engineering group TI from sliding with the market. Agency broker James Capel
upgraded its recommendation from hold to buy and BZW was also enthusiastic.
However, TI has a significant exposure to the US and the weakness in the Dow
saw the shares close 9 off at 400p.
Reed International which is also heavily exposed to the US fell 19 to 880p
ahead of full-year figures on Thursday.
Reuters Holdings slid 50p to 2048p after Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock
to neutral from buy in the intermediate term. Analyst Mr Neil Barton said he
still rated the company as a long-term buy, but the share price had risen
too fast.
Leading pharmaceutical stocks were holding their own after a bout of
weakness earlier in the week. Glaxo was unchanged at 661p and Wellcome,
which is to report first-half figures on March 24, rose a penny to 627p.
However, Goldman Sachs argues that concerns over the headline drugs Zovirax
and Retrovir will lead to further weakness in the shares.
Rolls-Royce held steady at 179 1/2 p with the support of a buy
recommendation from Williams de Broe.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forte speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was further strong speculation that Forte may be about to announce the
purchase of the French-owned hotel chain Meridien after a French news agency
reported the two sides were in discussions. Air France, which owns a
majority stake in the 53-strong chain, is said to be entertaining offers
with several other international hotel groups said to have expressed an
interest.
The rumour helped depress Forte's share price as the market fretted over the
possibility of a rights issue. They closed off 9 at 255p with turnover a
lowly 2.2m. However, analysts pointed out that a large proportion of
Meridien's hotels are operated on management contracts, with the equity
being owned by outside investors, a fact that would reduce the price of any
prospective deal. Should Forte emerge as the buyer of Meridien, it would go
some way to making up for the disappointment of losing the deal for Ciga,
the luxury Italian chain, last month.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hopes lift Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing optimism about Barclays Bank's dividend paying capacity prompted
another powerful performance by the bank's shares which extended Thursday's
late rally. News that Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank, had
added Barclays shares to its list of best buys helped to boost the stock.
Mr Rod Barrett, Goldman's UK banks specialist, said both Barclays and
Natwest were cheap stocks in the sector. He said the appointment of Mr
Martin Taylor as Barclays' new chief executive was an 'influence for the
positive' and he expected the bank to build from a base of lower provisions.
The Goldman recommendation was preceded by sustained and heavy buying of
Barclays. Other big broking houses, such as Lehman Brothers, were also said
to have been recommending the shares.
However, news that Standard  Poor's, the US debt-rating agency had placed
its double 'A' senior debt ratings for Barclays on creditwatch took the
shares down from the day's high of 536p. They closed 9 up at 519p on
turnover of 24m. S  P said Barclays' underlying profitability was
satisfactory but provisions were high and there appeared to be further
deterioration of asset quality in Europe and the US.
NatWest responded to Goldman's positive stance, ending the session
marginally higher at 467p.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar continued its slide on foreign exchanges yesterday to touch its
lowest level in four months, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency continues to suffer from the political fallout of the
Whitewater scandal and closed in London at DM1.6779, down from DM1.6893 on
Thursday.
Further undermining the dollar was an upward revision in Germany's January
M3 figure, to an annualised 21.2 per cent from 20.6 per cent, which could
slow the decline in German interest rates.
Sterling was also weaker, pulled down by the dollar and worse than
anticipated December trade figures. The trade weighted index fell to 80.5
from 81.
The dollar fell yesterday when the Commerce Department reported February US
retail sales rose 1.5 per cent after a downward revision in the January
figure to a 1.6 per cent decline. The figures cancelled each other out, but
the vulnerable dollar lost ground anyway.
Although the Bundesbank deputy president Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the
upward revision of German M3 figures was 'economically insignificant', it
did cause heavy selling pressure on the dollar.
The dollar closed slightly weaker against the yen at Y105.125 from Y105.695
on Thursday. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said
the Bank of Japan continued to support the dollar when it fell below Y105. A
slight cooling of the trade dispute between the two countries had also taken
some pressure off the exchange rate.
Sterling fell by nearly a pfennig and a half to close at DM2.521 from
DM2.5364. Part of the weakness was attributable to weaker than expected
trade figures. The visible trade deficit rose to Pounds 1.57bn in December
from Pounds 1.28bn in November.
The trade figures, however, only gave added impetus to an already weak
sterling.
Mr Stuart Frost, technical analyst at Natwest Treasury, said the fall in
sterling was a 'dollar inspired move'. Going back to October, every time
sterling has reached the Dollars 1.50/1.51 level, it has been sold off.
This selling pressure then spills over into the Pounds /D-Mark rate too. He
said that when sterling breached the important DM2.53 support level - before
the trade figures were released - this had prompted aggressive selling from
technical operators.
Deteriorating sentiment about the interest rate outlook was also reflected
in the futures market. The June short sterling contract fell by five points
to 94.85, indicating that the market only anticipates a 10 basis point fall
in interest rates by the middle of the year.
Aggravating matters has been the strength of the D-Mark which has firmed on
the perception that the Bundesbank will only cut rates slowly.
The D-Mark had a quiet day in Europe ending marginally weaker against the
French franc at FFr3.402 from FFr3.404. It was stronger against the Italian
lira, finishing at L990.9 from L990.1
Liquidity conditions in the discount market were fairly easy with the
overnight rate fluctuating between 3 3/4 per cent and 6 per cent. The Bank
put Pounds 1.112bn liquidity into the system compared to its forecast of a
Pounds 1.45bn shortage, revised up from Pounds 1.35bn.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): US funds fuel gold price
rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gold price recovered from an early set back this week to end near the
top of its recent trading range.
After a neutral start the market was undermined on Tuesday by news that
Japan was planning to sell about 90 tonnes of melted-down surplus gold
coins. A three months low of Dollars 375.35 a troy ounce was quickly reached
and, after a tentative rally, was undercut by another 5 cents the following
morning.
But that proved to be the trigger for a salvo of trade buying and
short-covering that lifted the price to Dollars 379.55 by Wednesday's close
and to Dollars 385 a day later. A five-week high of Dollars 387.10 an ounce
was set at yesterday morning's London bullion market price fixing, but by
the close profit-taking had trimmed that to Dollars 387, up Dollars 10.50 on
the week.
The price surge had been fuelled, traders said, by options-realted buying in
New York and by funds seeking a haven as the Whitewater rumours rocked US
bond, equity and currency markets. Another bullish influence was growing
concern about the political situation in South Africa in the run-up to next
month's elections.
That last factor was still more potent for the platinum market, especially
with regard to the homeland of Bophuthatswana, which accounts for 30 per
cent of South African mine production of the metal, equating to about 20 per
cent of world output.
The London platinum price was fixed at a seven-month high of Dollars 405.50
an ounce yesterday morning, but was pared back in the afternoon to Dollars
403.75, up Dollars 12,25 on the week.
Silver also joined in the fun, aided by increasing interest from US
investment funds. The London cash price ended the week 19 1/2 cents higher
at Dollars 4.03 3/4 an ounce.
London Metal Exchange copper traders, having twice failed to breach Dollars
1,920 a tonne for the three months delivery position and subsequently tested
the solidity of support below Dollars 1,900, finally succeeded yesterday in
their efforts to gain a foothold in higher ground. The price closed at
Dollars 1,929 a tonne, up Dollars 22.50 on the day and Dollars 15 on the
week.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that the late surge, which was
encouraged by a big fall in exchange warehouse stocks and a slight narrowing
in the cash discount, or 'contango', could have set the market up for a push
towards Dollars 1,950 a tonne.
Aluminium was also firmer yesterday, though the three months delivery
position's Dollars 14 rise to Dollars 1,299.50 a tonne still left it Dollars
3 down on the week. The market was aided by confirmation of an 8,000-tonnes
a year output cut at Norway's Soer-Norge smelter, although earlier in the
week it had taken little cheer from news of a planned 20,000 tonnes a year
cut by Aluminium Bahrain, the Gulf's largest producer and the first to back
multilateral efforts to balance the market.
The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee market was trying to
consolidate yesterday after a a sustained rise had run into upside
resistance. The May futures position touched a three-month peak of Dollars
1,285 on Thursday and again yesterday before closing at Dollars 1,275 a
tonne, up Dollars 26 on the week.
'The market is still looking in good shape if we can consolidate around
here,' one trader commented.
The initial uptrend had led some traders to suggest that a rise to Dollars
1,300 was possible, but others had foreseen that there would be strong
resistance in the Dollars 1,280-Dollars 1,288 range.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grumman shares soar 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Grumman rose 18 per cent yesterday as Wall Street prepared for a
Dollars 2bn bid battle over the defence contractor between Martin Marietta,
which launched an agreed takeover on Monday, and Northrop, which unveiled a
hostile offer on Thursday night.
Grumman shares, which started the month at Dollars 37 1/2 , soared a further
Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange
following Northrop's cash offer of Dollars 60 a share, valuing the group at
Dollars 2.04bn.
Mr Peter Aseritis, an analyst at First Boston, said that 'a bidding war
could result in a winning bid that does not make economic sense'.
Martin Marietta said it would respond to Northrop's bid 'in an appropriate
manner at the appropriate time'.
Hostile bids are unusual in the defence sector, and Martin Marietta
complained that 'the attack by Northrop degrades the entire character of the
rational consolidation taking place within the US's national security
industrial base'.
Northrop coupled Thursday's bid with an attack on Grumman's board for
entering into a deal with Martin Marietta, even though Northrop and Grumman
had spent months in late 1993 and early 1994 discussing a friendly merger.
It complained that Grumman had neither informed Northrop it was in
negotiations with another party or invited the company's best bid.
It described as 'improper and illegal' a so-called lock-up agreement, under
which Grumman will pay Martin Marietta Dollars 50m if its offer for the
company is outbid.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (9): Sweet dreams that can
turn into nightmares - So you've got your gold watch and now you want a
proper garden. Don't let sentiment take over / Gardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retirement offers every keen gardener the sweetest of dreams. No longer will
gardening be slotted into weekends and those summer evenings when, for a
marvel, the train is on time. Retirement opens a prospect of unhurried days
and years. Even so, before throwing yourself into an orgy of improvements,
it is worth taking an unsentimental look at your garden and its
surroundings. Does it really merit your energies for the rest of your
gardening days?
Just as a significant proportion of couples decide, on reaching retirement,
that life could be a good deal pleasanter with a new partner, the same is
true of the garden. Although it might be painful in the short term, parting
from your old garden could be vastly better than slogging on with a hopeless
case.
Think about the features of your present garden that no amount of time and
money will change. Is it sun-less? Does it lie in a frost pocket, year after
year frustrating your ambition to send superb apples to the local flower
show? If it has hungry, stony soil or back-straining clay, does it really
deserve more years of struggle?
But as in the search for a new human partner, however, it behoves you to be
circumspect when choosing a new one. Otherwise, you could end up in a worse
plight than before.
First, there is the soil. Gardeners who are house-hunting should insist on
making several substantial test digs around the place. One probe is not
enough because it is sod's law (literally) that you will dig at the only
patch of workable soil.
Light is a trickier factor. House-hunting in winter can disguise the fact
that, in the summer, umbrageous trees to the south may take most or all of
the sun.
Even if that does not concern you horticulturally, it could matter very much
if basking in a conservatory was part of the plan. And if the new house is
in a conservation area, or if the trees have a local authority protection
order, you will be prevented from felling them - or even pruning them
heavily.
Few people recognise that summer house-hunting also has drawbacks. It is
important to think ahead to winter and work out the angles for those months
when the sun hangs low. Otherwise, your new garden could overshadowed by
surrounding buildings. Crocuses will never open and the soil will remain
cold late into spring.
If you are house-hunting in winter and spring, many things may go
undetected. Only the growing season will reveal if the borders are riddled
with couch grass, bindweed and ground elder. That is why the general feel of
a garden, kempt or unkempt, pruned or left wild, is so revealing.
Anyone who is not yet a good gardener, but means to become so in retirement,
would do well to take a knowledgeable friend to view the short-listed
gardens and look for signs of criminal neglect. It is unlikely that borders
gone wild would put you off buying a lovely property, but at least you would
know to expect the worst.
Once the most thuggish weeds have run amok through a border and tightened
their stranglehold on roses, paths and box hedges, there is no way you will
ever get rid of them without starting again.
This means hard work: lifting plants, replacing them if they are
inextricably weed-bound, and using weed-killer (unless you are absurdly
namby-pamby and propose to devote years to the job). Reclaiming a garden
from the worst kinds of perennial weeds will be neither cheap nor quick.
The matter of whether the soil is acid or alkaline is crucial only to
gardeners who have a particular passion for certain plant families. Whatever
is growing already in a garden or its surrounds probably will show whether
gentians or rhododendrons are to be part of your new gardening life.
These are deep matters, which matter to gardeners alone. Do not expect
estate agents to be any help in tracking down a garden for your golden
afternoons. Even so, when I toyed with finding a cottage in the Cotswolds
last year, it was a shock to find how feeble they were. Awareness of
Britain's most popular leisure activity has yet to impinge on your average
chap with a clip-board. I was on the books of eight agents, not one with
software allowing it to specify that I should receive particulars only of
gardens above my minimum acceptable size. Two-thirds of particulars gave no
indication of the area of garden with a property.
Even more infuriating was that, when I rang agents, they often had no
precise idea of the size of the gardens they were handling. Rather than take
measurements, they preferred to suggest you made a time-consuming journey to
see for yourself.
My own house in central Oxford has an unusually large, south-facing garden
for the area. Yet, when thinking of selling, I had to insist on the
particulars being reprinted to include the measurements and a brief
description of the garden.
All the same, it is worth pondering the crucial matter of how big a garden
you want for retirement. Something larger is tempting: finally, you might
think, here is the chance to make a water garden, grow alpines in raised
beds, or plant an orchard. But there is the problem of time and Time.
Time with a small 't' simply means not under-estimating how busy you could
still be, even in retirement. Again, the life partner enters into it.
By now, it will be apparent whether he or she is a gardener. If not, it is
hardly tactful to start making a still bigger garden - which, inevitably,
would occupy much of your energies - when the non-gardening spouse's
perception of retirement was travelling the world and seeing more of the
family.
Then, there is the larger question of Time. Good gardeners know it already
but novices never do: a new garden is a slow business. It takes 10 years
before an orchard gives a reasonable return, four years before old roses
start to perform well, and the same for a newly-planted herbaceous border to
start looking like the picture in your mind's eye.
Retirement should usher in two decades or so of vigorous activity. But
gardeners who are perfectionists by nature have to accept that they make a
rod for their own backs if they take on too big a plot. As the joints begin
to stiffen, it is always possible to resort more and more to hired labour.
But if part of the charm of finishing work was to get away from dealing with
personnel problems, it is perhaps not the best idea to make them an integral
part of your retirement scenario. Even with a large and challenging garden,
it is extremely hard to find knowledgeable, hard-working, full-time
gardeners in sympathy with the owner's own tastes.
All in all, then, it might be sensible to be circumspect when hunting for
the retirement garden and scaling down, not up. This need not mean loss of
face or less challenging gardening - quite the reverse if you start to
specialise.
Vic Dickson-Cohen, one of the best gardeners in retirement I know, has given
up most of his plot in north London to raising alpines by using a
low-maintenance, professional-standard alpine house. It means he can garden
whatever the weather and round the clock, making even winter bright with his
hardy cyclamen collection.
The maker, CJ Waterhouse, of Buckhurst Works, Bells Yew Green, Tunbridge
Wells (0892-750247), sells mostly to customers buying for their retirement.
They pay around Pounds 3,700 (plus VAT) for a complete 10ft by 8ft alpine
house.
If stopping work leaves no outlet for the competitive instinct, growing for
the show bench is the answer. New worlds of skill and one-upmanship can be
opened through membership of, say, the Royal Horticultural Society or the
Hardy Plant Society, or more specialised groups such as the National
Auricula and Primula Societies, the Pot Leek Society - even the oddly-named
Mammillaria Society.
The RHS will supply the addresses; its own Horticultural Shows' Handbook is
a guide to the cut and thrust of wickedly competitive gardening in
retirement.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro to raise NKr5bn by
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy and fertilisers group, is raising up to
NKr5bn (Dollars 676m) - some 10 per cent of its stock market value - through
an international rights issue, to strengthen financial flexibility.
Hydro intends to use the proceeds to reduce interest-bearing debt, finance
expansion and invest in new North Sea oil and pipeline projects.
The government has recommended that the state, which holds 51 per cent of
Hydro's share capital, participate with NKr2.6bn to maintain its 51 per cent
stake in the company.
Hydro could conceivably raise NKr600m in the domestic market, where 15.5 per
cent of its share capital is held, and the remaining NKr1.8bn in foreign
markets, where 33.5 per cent of shares are traded.
Mr Jens Stoltenberg, Industry and Energy Minister, said he was confident the
state would win the necessary approval from the Storting (parliament) to
participate in the move. It intended to table a proposal before Easter to
enable the issue to take place in June.
The state's shareholding in Hydro would be reduced to 45 per cent if it did
not acquire new shares.
Proceeds of the issue are to be used to reduce interest-bearing debt from
NKr24bn to between NKr15bn and NKr20bn. Hydro also plans to spend about
NKr8bn annually over the next five years, partly to finance participation in
North Sea oil and pipeline projects.
Expansion opportunities are also being sought in Asia and in downstream
businesses.
Hydro's last rights issue was in 1988, when it raised NKr2.5bn. Since 1988,
the company has invested NKr50bn. Half of this has been related to oil and
gas projects, which have since doubled Hydro's production to around 9.4m
tonnes of oil equivalent in 1993.
Last year, Hydro made a net profit of NKr1.2bn - excluding gains from the
disposal of a stake in Freia Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate producer -
against NKr1.8bn in 1992.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Japanese broker warns of
write-off
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kankaku Securities, the Japanese broker, is to write off Y50bn (Dollars
472.4m) in losses stemming from illicit client transactions. It will slide
further into the red as a result.
Mr Yoichiro Kato, Kankaku's president, said the broker would suffer a
pre-tax loss of Y77bn for the year ending this month, against Y51bn a year
ago. It had earlier forecast a pre-tax profit of Y300m.
Kankaku, one of Japan's 10 so-called second-tier brokers, expects to incur a
net loss of Y76bn. It will again omit the dividend.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the big commercial bank which holds a 4.9 per cent
stake in Kankaku, will provide the broker with Y70bn in subordinated loans.
The announcement follows last year's bail-out by Daiwa Bank of Cosmo
Securities, which was hit by heavy losses due to illegal share deals. Cosmo
became the first Japanese broker to be rescued by a bank.
The two rescue moves come as the country's medium-sized and small brokers
continue to suffer from the effects of a shake-out in the Tokyo stock
market. During the stock market boom of the late 1980s, some brokers had
aspired to rise to the ranks of the Big Four - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and
Yamaichi - and expanded rapidly, making large capital investments.
Where possible, Japan's ministry of finance is determined to prop up weak
brokers and banks to preserve confidence in the Japanese financial markets.
Financial bureaucrats are pushing larger and healthier banks and brokers to
help weaker counterparts to restructure.
Support plans for other second-tier brokers are expected shortly. Sanyo
Securities, the most aggressive of the medium-sized brokers, is currently at
the last stages of negotiations with its creditor banks - Bank of Tokyo,
Daiwa Bank, and Nippon Credit Bank - and Nomura Securities, its leading
shareholder. It may announce a restructuring next week.
Kankaku said several employees arranged trades to shift loss-carrying
securities held by some of the company's leading clients to other customer
accounts between 1986 and 1990.
The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities
watchdog, yesterday advised the ministry of finance to take punitive action
against Kankaku over the illegal deals.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and energy group, has sold
its remaining 6 per cent stake in Methanex, the world's biggest methanol
producer. The disposal is part of the group's drive to raise cash by
disposing of peripheral businesses.
Metallgesellschaft raised CDollars 127m (USDollars 94m) from its shares,
which were sold in a block trade on the Toronto stock exchange by a
syndicate of Canadian securities dealers led by Gordon Capital. A Gordon
official said the shares were widely distributed.
Until early last year, it had a 32 per cent controlling stake in Methanex,
which is based in Vancouver. However, it has gradually reduced its interest
over the past year.
Methanex's single biggest shareholder is now Nova, the Calgary-based
pipeline and chemicals group, with a 24 per cent interest. New Zealand's
Fletcher Challenge, which was a big shareholder in Methanex, also decided
last year to withdraw from the methanol business.
Metallgesellschaft is reviewing many of its investments as part of efforts
to recover from the huge losses suffered in international oil trading.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mazda, the Japanese carmaker, expects non-consolidated pre-tax losses for
this year to be substantially heavier than forecast.
The company said losses would widen to Y45bn (Dollars 425.3m) from a
previously-estimated Y32bn. It blamed a steeper-than-expected downturn in
the domestic market, and the adverse impact of the yen's appreciation. Sales
are expected to be Y1,770bn rather than the Y1,890bn forecast in November.
Mazda, 24.5 per cent-owned by Ford Motor of the US, has already announced
its intention to pass its dividend.
This is the third time the carmaker has been forced to revise its forecast
for this year. Mazda said that while it had made strenuous efforts to reduce
costs by between 20 and 30 per cent, this had not been sufficient to cover
the weaker sales.
In the domestic market, Mazda saw unit sales fall from 460,200 to 400,000.
While Japanese carmakers have generally suffered amid the domestic economic
slump, Mazda has been one of the hardest hit.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banesto contest opened to
foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European banks are to be allowed to bid for control of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank for which the Bank of Spain is
mounting a rescue operation.
European Union regulations have forced the Madrid authorities to change
plans which would have ensured that Banesto, with a network of 2,500
branches, stayed in Spanish hands. Bids for the bank were to have been
restricted to banks participating in Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund, which
is bearing much of the burden of the rescue operation.
However, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor, yesterday told a
parliamentary committee investigating the Banesto affair that these plans
had been abandoned because they would breach European Union rules.
The change also means Argentaria, the state-controlled banking group, can
compete on an equal footing with other bidders. The conditions previously
under discussion were expected to force Argentaria to pay a premium, since
it only began contributing to the fund in 1991.
Argentaria is one of three Spanish banks to have declared an interest in
Banesto, alongside Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco Santander. There is also
speculation about a consortium bid by savings banks.
The deadline for bids has been set for April 25, with a decision due to be
announced on May 9.
The Deposit Guarantee Fund is to plough Pta285bn (Dollars 2bn) into Banesto,
with half coming from the banking sector and half from the Bank of Spain.
The fund will also provide an interest-free loan to Banesto of about
Pta300bn, and will initially subscribe to a Pta180bn capital increase,
making up 73 per cent of Banesto's restructured equity base.
Would-be buyers will have to bid for the whole of this stake and commit
themselves to keeping a fixed proportion.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa returns to black
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurer, rebounded to an operating profit of
SKr1.72bn (Dollars 215.3m) in 1993 from a SKr5.14bn deficit the year before.
The insurer has left behind huge losses associated with the country's
banking crisis and begun to disengage from reinsurance.
The result followed a similar turnround announced earlier this week by
Skandia, Sweden's other big insurance group. It posted a record operating
profit in 1993 of SKr2.01bn. Trygg is to pay a dividend of SKr3.00 per share
after suspending the payout last year.
The main factor in Trygg's turnround was the non-recurring SKr6.03 loss
incurred in 1992, when the group's large holdings in Gota AB, the holding
company of state-rescued Gota Bank, and two collapsed credit insurers were
written down to zero.
However, Trygg also benefited in 1993 from a 77 per cent improvement in its
insurance result, which rose to a profit of SKr890m from SKr502m, and a leap
in investment income to SKr1.1bn from SKr133m.
Trygg said a significant factor in the insurance result was a drop in losses
from reinsurance, reached SKr470m in 1992, in part due to the cost of its
exposure to Hurrican Andrew. The group stopped writing new reinsurance
business in October last year.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro to lift dividend by 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, is to raise its 1993 dividend by
slightly more than 5 per cent, after posting a 20 per cent increase in net
profit last year.
Net profit rose to Fl 2.02bn (Dollars 1.05bn) from Fl 1.68bn in 1992, with
European operations contributing by far the largest percentage increase in
growth. The dividend is to be raised to Fl 3.05 per share from Fl 2.90.
Mr Robert Hazelhoff, chairman, said results improved across the board last
year. '(But) the icing on the cake was the exceptional year for equities,'
he said.
Total revenue rose 13.4 per cent to Fl 14.1bn, outstripping the 10.8 per
cent increase in total costs, to Fl 10.9bn.
Pre-tax operating results in Europe surged almost three-fold, to Fl 442m
from Fl 117m. This easily surpassed the 12.3 per cent increase in ABN Amro's
home market. However, the bank's Dutch business is far larger in absolute
terms, accounting for Fl 1.97bn out of the group's total operating profits
of Fl 3.17bn.
In the US, the bank's second most important market, pre-tax operating profit
rose only 0.4 per cent to Fl 532m. This limited rise was due to provisions,
already reported at mid-year, to cover risks in debt securities. Without the
item, US profits would have been up nearly 24 per cent.
Overall, foreign operations posted a combined 47.7 per cent increase in
operating profit.
Mr Hazelhoff said ABN Amro was reaping the rewards of acquisitions of
European stockbrokers.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Vivat improves to Pounds 3.43m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vivat Holdings, the maker of jeans and casual wear, mainly under the Lee
Cooper brand name, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.43m in the year to
December 31 1993, against a restated Pounds 1.95m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 71.2m (Pounds 67.6m), influenced by favourable
currency movements, and generated operating profits of Pounds 5.42m (Pounds
4.36m).
A saving in overheads which resulted from the closure of the group's German
business, together with a significant reduction of bad debts in Spain,
compensated for the cost of restructuring the French sales force and an
increase in marketing expenditure, the company said.
However, with difficult trading conditions in its principal markets, the
company had a long way to go to match the profit levels of the early 1980s.
The proposed single dividend is raised to 1.25p (1p), payable from earnings
of 3.5p (2p).

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Building a closer customer relationship -
How Girobank is changing the face of the Alliance  Leicester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the slightly cosy and domestic image of building societies, it seems
appropriate that one society chief executive should try to explain the
relationship between Alliance  Leicester, the UK's fourth largest society,
and its Girobank subsidiary, in familial terms.
'It's like having a teenage child living at home and bringing in a large
slice of the family income, but having no say in the decisions,' he says.
The slice of income brought in by Girobank has been impressive. In 1993, it
amounted to Pounds 75m of AL's Pounds 205m pre-tax profits, while the
previous year it contributed just over half of the pre-tax profits of Pounds
122.5m.
Indeed, the contribution goes beyond the obvious pre-tax profits, since
Girobank also pays dividends into the main group accounts.
In 1992, it accounted for most of the Pounds 37.5m income from shares in
subsidiaries which was attributed to the society. In 1991, it contributed
almost Pounds 30m in a similar form. These were substantial amounts,
particularly in 1991 when the society was suffering heavy losses on its
commercial lending.
The purchase of Girobank from the Post Office in 1990 for Pounds 112m thus
looks like a bargain in more ways than one.
'We bought Girobank because we felt we needed a current account,' says Mr
Peter White, now group chief executive. 'It was a question then of getting a
long-term strategy for where we wanted to be in retail financial services.
Having bought Girobank, we were much more relationship-driven.'
In bringing to the fore this greater emphasis on relationship with the
customer rather than on product, the link with Girobank was one of the
driving forces behind the group's strategic review.
The strategy, based on advice from Gemini consultants, was agreed by the AL
board in April last year, and the process of implementation has continued
since - though there is still some way to go.
The first change most customers are likely to notice will be in May, when
Girobank's 1.4m personal customers are moved into AL, though they will
still be able to use post office facilities and telephone banking services.
Soon after that, a new current account - the Alliance account - will be
launched, as a further stage in the integration process.
The move will roughly halve Girobank's balance sheet, as retail savings
worth about Pounds 1bn are transferred to AL. This has the added benefit of
giving AL extra liquidity which will stand it in good stead for the
recovery of the mortgage market.
It will also provide greatly enhanced opportunities for cross-selling
financial products to different groups of customers, as the overlap between
AL and Girobank customers is relatively small.
Mr White sees this as one of the key tasks for the coming months: 'It will
take us another year to get complete cross-selling,' he says.
Girobank, itself, will be left with its fixed assets, a small amount of
commercial lending and its profitable money transmission operation.
Though Mr White insists that no decision has been taken, there must be a
question of how far the successful cash transmission business - high in
volume but low in margin - will belong in the future within an organisation
intended to focus on its relationship with personal customers.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies' analyst at UBS, says that the remaining
parts of Girobank are now in a state when they could be packaged up: the
money transmission business could well fetch more than the whole
organisation cost AL in 1990, he suggests.
The role of two other, minor, subsidiaries is easier to see in a
relationship-driven AL. Both AL personal finance, the unsecured loan
subsidiary, and AL estate agency have a rationale within that concept, and
both are likely to be maintained as separate operations.
In the drive towards customer relationships and cross-selling, the greatest
question which AL has yet to decide is its strategy for moving into
insurance and equity products. At present the society acts as a tied agent
for Scottish Amicable, a life insurance company.
'We'll know what we want to do within the year,' Mr White says. Unless AL
is out of kilter with the trend elsewhere in the sector, the assumption must
be that it will probably set up its own life company in order to have
greater control of the products it sells.
Mr White argues that the amount of management time and effort devoted to the
review over the past couple of years has not really cost the society
anything as, in his words, 'there's been no mortgage market'.
The cost may have been, however, in terms of a delay in any ambitions in
converting the group into a plc. Two years ago the society was already being
tipped as likely to follow Abbey National which converted to plc status in
1989.
While those prospects were delayed because of the commercial lending losses,
Mr White's stance now is that there is nothing the society wants to do that
it cannot do while retaining its mutual status, given that the Building
Societies Commission, the statutory regulator, 'seems willing to be flexible
in its approach'.
His view may well change as competition increases further in both mortgage
and savings markets.
In those circumstances, AL would not have the two or three years of good,
sustainable results behind it that any society would want as a basis for
conversion, and it may well be that the investment in the strategy will not
be reflected fully until the 1995 results.
At present it looks as though it will be worth the wait.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury to axe 650 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery retailer, is cutting about 650 jobs in
its head and area offices over the next eight months as part of a
restructuring of its business.
The company had warned in January - when it announced a fall in gross profit
margins and underlying sales - that job losses could not be ruled out as a
result of a business review carried out in conjunction with external
consultants.
Yesterday's announcement follows a similar move by Tesco, the UK's
second-biggest supermarket group, which said last month it was cutting 800
full-time jobs.
Sainsbury said the aim was to 'concentrate effort on providing outstanding
service throughout all parts of the business and to simplify and rationalise
operations and eliminate overlaps'.
The job losses, together with a series of other initiatives in Sainsbury's
head and area offices, are expected to lead to annual cost savings of about
Pounds 50m. Sainsbury expects to make a provision of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 20m to cover the redundancy costs in its current year results.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Design side spending limits Abbott Mead to
Pounds 4.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group, yesterday reported a slight
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.75m for the year to December 31
against Pounds 4.72m in 1992.
The figure, which disappointed analysts, was held back by investment in the
group's design subsidiary, McBain Noel-Johnson, where profits fell from
Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1m. Excluding this expenditure, AMV said group
operating profit was up 26 per cent, on an underlying basis.
The shares closed down 22p at 708p.
Group turnover increased by almost 20 per cent to Pounds 201.2m (Pounds
167.9m).
Earnings per share were static at 18.7p but confidence about prospects for
1994 means the board is recommending a final dividend of 7.3p making a total
of 10.5p, a 12.9 per cent increase.
AMV had a record year for new business wins, which totalled Pounds 70m of
billings on an annualised basis. Gains included Gossard, Ever Ready,
Tambrands, Gillette and British Gas.
Mr David Abbott, chairman, said 1994 had started exceptionally well, with
new business totalling over Pounds 75m on an annualised basis.
A British Telecommunications contract, worth Pounds 50m in annual billings,
is described by AMV as the 'largest single new business win in the history
of British advertising'. The group is currently pitching for business which
would be worth Pounds 76m in billings.
Mr Peter Mead, chief executive, said there were 'real signs of growth' in
client spending. 'I don't see any requirement to be gloomy any more,' he
said.
Investment in the development of electronic systems which will allow images
and words for advertising campaigns to be manipulated on a computer network
by clients in their own offices, is already yielding new business, including
a three-year, fixed-fee contract with Delta Airlines.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lawnmower buy for Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins, the UK-based conglomerate, is making its first acquisition since
its Pounds 990m takeover of food group Ranks Hovis McDougall in December
1992.
It is paying about Dollars 115m (Pounds 78m) for the lawnmower and
snowblower businesses of Noma Industries, a quoted Canadian group.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, described it as 'an excellent bolt-on'
to Murray Ohio, the group's US lawnmower manufacturer.
'It is a smaller competitor with a complementary range of lawnmowers. The
snowblowers, which are about 25 per cent of turnover, give us some counter
seasonal activity.'
Tomkins is paying less than asset value for the businesses which had sales
of Dollars 239.4m last year. Tomkins has agreed not to disclose what, if
any, profits it made but Mr Hutchings admitted it had been 'struggling'.
It has two modern factories in Tennessee and one in Brampton, Ontario. Most
of the sales are in the US with the rest split between Canada and Europe.
Mr David Lang, an analyst at brokers Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'It will
ease Murray Ohio's capacity shortage in America and gives them a window into
Canada.'
Mr Hutchings would not comment on plans for the Noma plants or quantify the
likely job losses. But, he said: 'It will be self-financing once we get to
grips with it.'
The consideration, which will be at a fixed discount of Dollars 11.75m to
net assets, will be met from existing cash resources which stood at Pounds
170m in October. Tomkins will also assume Dollars 16.7m of long-term debt
and operating lease liabilities of Dollars 12.4m.
The businesses consist of Outdoor Products, which makes and distributes of
power mowers, garden tractors and snowblowers, and Dynamark Plastics, a
small custom injection moulder, which supplies Outdoor Products and other
Noma Industries businesses.
Competition in the US lawnmower market has been fierce and in the six months
to October Tomkins said Murray Ohio had made volume gains at the expense of
lower margins.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wellington valued at Pounds 48.5m in stock
market flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wellington Holdings, the seals and rubber products group which is
coming to the stock market, have been priced at almost 20 times pro forma
1993 earnings.
The rating is a premium to both Avon Rubber, the nearest comparable company,
and to the engineering sector.
Mr John Herring, of sponsors Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the pricing
reflected strong demand from institutions. 'It seemed to catch their
imaginations, partly because it is an easy to understand manufacturing
business which is quite rare among new issues these days.'
Mr Peter Chaffin, chief executive, said: 'We are really chuffed both at the
price and at the reception.'
Just over half of Wellington's shares are being placed with institutions at
205p, valuing its enlarged equity at Pounds 48.5m.
The company is raising Pounds 13.5m net of expenses while First Britannia,
the venture capital fund which owned 90 per cent of the existing shares, is
selling shares worth Pounds 10m. Its stake will fall to 40 per cent.
Directors and senior managers, who have just bought shares from First
Britannia for a nominal sum prior to the float, are selling shares worth
almost Pounds 800,000. They will be left with 8.6 per cent.
Wellington's operating profit increased by almost 26 per cent to Pounds 4.2m
last year generating earnings per share of 8.26p. That rises to 10.35p on a
pro forma basis. The notional dividend for 1993 was 5.17p for a yield at the
placing price of 3.15 per cent.
Commenting on the outlook for the current year, the company said that 1993
had ended 'encouragingly' with the order book 30 per cent higher than a year
earlier. 'The directors are confident that the prospects for 1994 are good
with organic growth anticipated across each of the group's three divisions.'
Dealings in the shares will start on March 21.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mercury units close at modest discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury's European privatisation investment trust units slipped to a modest
6.8 per cent discount against their offer price when dealings in packages of
five shares with one warrant attached began trading yesterday.
The units closed at 468p compared with the 500p offer price with a
relatively low 2.25m units changing hands. Separate trading in the shares
and warrants is due to begin on April 25.
The Mercury trust was less than Pounds 4m oversubscribed when it closed
earlier this month, but still became the largest investment trust ever
launched. Its maximum size was set at Pounds 575m after Pounds 325m had been
raised in a placing with institutional investors.
Mr Jonathan Ruck Keene, director of Mercury Asset Management Private
Clients, said the modest discount reflected market conditions and was not
surprising. 'It is what you would expect on a day like today,' he said,
adding that the discount was in line with trading in shares of the similar
Kleinwort European privatisation trust which was launched last month.
Shares in the substantially oversubscribed Pounds 500m Kleinwort trust, in
effect, closed at a slight 4 per cent premium to their offer price when they
began trading in February but have since slipped back.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Readymix, the Irish building materials group, saw pre-tax profits decline by
IPounds 660,000 to IPounds 2.33m (Pounds 2.24m) in the year to end-December
1993, on turnover up by 3 per cent from IPounds 30.8m to IPounds 31.7m.
The company said that, despite continuing efforts to minimise its cost base,
lower selling prices and a fall in demand for cement-based products had
eroded margins from 9.7 per cent in 1992 to 7.4 per cent last year.
Earnings per share fell to 5.13p (6.57p).
Nevertheless, an improved final dividend of 2.45p (2.35p) is proposed,
raising the total for the year to 3p (2.9p).

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pharmakopius flotation postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned flotation of Pharmakopius International has been postponed
because of 'volatility' in the biotechnology sector.
Originally planned for February 16, the flotation had already been pushed
back and yesterday the company admitted it had been shelved 'for the time
being'.
It insisted that the decision did not reflect lack of interest in
Pharmakopius itself from potential investors. 'The interest is there, but a
number of institutions are getting nervous about the sector.'
It pointed to the recent flotation of Chiroscience, a biotechnology company
whose Pounds 100m valuation was criticised as too high by some analysts.
But at 147p Chiroscience's shares are only 3p below the issue price, and
other shares in the sector, notably British Bio-technology, have performed
well in recent weeks.
The company scotched rumours that it had failed to meet the Stock Exchange
requirements for a listing. Unlike many biotechnology companies Pharmakopius
has a profitable trading record.

Restructuring costs of Pounds 696,000 left Forward Technology Industries
with pre-tax profits for 1993 lower at Pounds 89,000, against Pounds
186,000.
Operating profit was 73 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 772,000). The
Sound  Vision audio cassette and CD activity was 26 per cent up while the
electronics side rose 80 per cent.
Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said that the result was encouraging despite the
recession in Germany and France which had less effect than had been
expected. He added that the restructuring costs were below the Pounds
800,000 anticipated.
The outcome was achieved on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 43.8m
(Pounds 40.2m). After a tax credit of Pounds 93,000 (Pounds 184,000 charge)
earnings per share were 0.5p, against breakeven. The company has decided to
pay a nominal single final dividend of 0.25p.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Headway cuts deficit to Pounds 0.6m in
unseasonal half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Headway, the consumer and industrial goods manufacturer, reported reduced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 628,000 for the six months ended December 31. The
comparable deficit was Pounds 883,000.
Historically, the group budgets for a loss in the first half because sales
by its dominant garden furniture subsidiary, Aronstead, are heavily biased
towards the final quarter.
All businesses other than Aronstead operated profitably in the first half,
the company said.
Turnover for the six months was 11.6 per cent higher at Pounds 11.2m and at
the operating level the deficit was reduced from Pounds 624,000 to Pounds
397,000.
Mr Andrew Staniland, chairman, said significant improvements had been made
to factory efficiencies in key areas, while working capital and borrowings
had both been kept under tight control. Gearing was reduced to 27.5 per cent
(34.9 per cent).
Reorganisation costs in continuing operations grew slightly to Pounds
130,000 (Pounds 103,000) but this was offset by a fall in net interest
payable to Pounds 101,000 (Pounds 156,000).
Losses per share emerged at 2.6p (3.7p).
In November the group acquired the Stansted Furniture Company, a
manufacturer of flatpack wooden furniture.
It is also to expand its Europa Sofabeds subsidiary by building a new
factory. The existing freehold properties have been sold for Pounds 440,000
 -in line with net book value.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: SP may downgrade Barclays' credit rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays' return to profitability has failed to impress Standard  Poor's,
the leading US rating agency, which yesterday announced that it was
considering lowering the bank's credit rating.
The move came a day after Barclays announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 664m
for last year, following a 1992 loss of Pounds 242m.
However, Standard  Poor's said it was dissatisfied with the low level of
retained earnings. While a substantial improvement on the previous year's
retained loss of Pounds 586m, Barclays' retained earnings of Pounds 67m were
'quite insignificant for their size,' said Mr Barry Hancock, a director of
SP.
'We have maintained our rating of AA through the last couple of
disappointing years, on the basis that the bank's strong underlying
performance will enable it to bounce back as earnings pick up, and use
strong retained earnings to strengthen its balance sheet,' Mr Hancock said.
'But we are now concerned that this recovery in performance is still some
way off.'
Barclays lost its triple-A rating from SP in February 1991, and was
downgraded to AA in June 1992. It is currently rated AA2 by Moody's and AA
by IBCA, which are equivalent ratings.
'I suppose they are worried about the problems in the US, which are the main
reason for low retained earnings, but those problems are firmly in the
past,' said Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' newly-appointed chief executive. 'I
hope we shall be able to convince the rating agencies that a number of
aspects of the figures, including the tax charge, are very prudently
stated.'
SP will meet with the management of Barclays in the next few weeks to
discuss the issues involved. The other rating agencies appeared unperturbed
by the Barclays results. 'I would argue that they are roughly what we
expected, or even a little better. Our general view is that we are past the
worst in the UK,' said Mr Robin Monroe-Davies, a managing director of IBCA,
which specialises in bank credit analysis. 'We do not expect to downgrade
any more UK banks.'
Barclays' shares gained 9p to close at 519p.

<TEXT>
Sir, In response to 'Wimp of the species' by Michael Thompson-Noel, our
hearts bleed for him. Where was he in the fight for female equality?
Cowering behind the lines hors de combat with a bad back] Dr Farrell's book
could go down in history as the first categorised as 'social comment' and
'comedy fiction'.
We would suggest that, if men's magazines concentrated on giving men
'special outlets and incentives to express their feelings and perspectives'
rather than gymnastically arranged big-breasted women and Lamborghinis, the
book would be superfluous. In the game of life, women now find themselves
running with the ball, while men lie crumpled in their wake bleating 'high
tackle . . . off-side . . . bad back]'
It's a sad sign of the (financial) times that 20 column inches are expended
on male whittering.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Hillary Agonistes: The maelstrom swirling around President
Clinton's wife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Washington is Salem,' the veteran lobbyist was quoted as saying about
something else. 'If we're not lynching somebody 24 hours a day in this
wretched town, we're not happy.'
Certainly the noose round Hillary Rodham Clinton's neck must have felt a
little tighter this week, a far cry from the adulation accorded her last
autumn when she took the town and country by storm with the clarity and
vigour of her presentation of the administration's healthcare reform plan,
as much as anybody else's her plan. This legislation finally got a
congressional hearing this week, but only the vested interests were
watching. All other eyes were on Whitewater and this most distinctive first
lady's presumed role at the heart of it.
Hillary's week has seen her portrayed variously as Lady Macbeth, Michael
Millken and Joan of Arc. It is best described in the words of her assailants
and defenders.
On Sunday the New York Times let loose Maureen Dowd on Hillary. Last year,
the Clintons, knowing Ms Dowd is a reporting trendsetter, sought to charm
her and she confessed in print to being charmed.
Not now. She clinically dissects the sources of Hillary Clinton's power,
beyond the relationship with her president husband, and sees them
collapsing. Her healthcare plan is in trouble in Congress; Bernard Nussbaum,
her old colleague on the Watergate prosecution team whom she championed, has
quit as legal counsel; questions are, perhaps cruelly, asked about the
circumstances of the suicide of Vincent Foster, the deputy counsel, her
close friend and former Rose Law Firm partner in Little Rock, Arkansas;
Webster Hubbell, also a Rose graduate, now associate attorney-general, is
under ethical fire.
Ms Dowd lards her story with lethal quotes: the influential, unnamed
Democratic friend of the Clintons who says, 'It's especially hard to run a
White House with no one in charge but two presidents'; the anonymous senior
official who comments, 'No one wants to tell Bill, or especially Hillary,
that they can't do things the way they're used to doing them'; Marlin
Fitzwater, press secretary to presidents Reagan and Bush, who gleefully
twists the knife and cracks, 'Don't say I said anything bad about Hillary,
I'm as scared of her as everyone else'.
The ink barely dry, Vice-President Al Gore, invariably the soul of reason,
goes to bat for her on a morning talk show. He detects a 'generational issue
 -it's relatively new to have a husband and wife who consider themselves
totally equal partners' not only in marriage but in work, including the work
of government. Ms Dowd's picture of the White House, he says, is 'a cartoon
image'.
On Monday the news magazines hit the street. Newsweek is particularly tough
in a big feature called 'Hillary's trouble'. Four of the 10 officials under
subpoena by Robert Fiske, the special counsel, are 'Hillary's employees or
allies'; there are reports of shredded documents at Rose, perhaps ordered by
her.
Again, many of the 'mood' quotes are anonymous but they are hard. 'Advisers
say no staffer wants to be the first to talk bluntly to Mrs Clinton because
of the 'fear wall' around her'. 'For the first time someone has questioned
her skill as a professional,' says an administration official, 'you can see
the pain in her bearing.' Even the firings of the White House chef, a
Frenchman unwilling to meet her taste for American fat-free cuisine, and an
usher, who made Mrs Clinton 'uncomfortable', are ascribed by innuendo to her
intolerance.
At least on Monday afternoon Bill Clinton stood by his woman. 'I believe I'm
a better authority than anyone else in America on my wife. I have never
known a person with a stronger sense of right and wrong in my life - ever.'
So did the National Organisation of Women, which held a rally in support of
her.
Nevertheless, on Tuesday, Mr Clinton brought in Lloyd Cutler, a wise old
Washington bird, as legal counsel. At 76, he needed no new challenges and he
agreed only to take on the job for 130 days - and not be paid for it. One
thing about Mr Cutler is certain: he will not be afraid to tell the
president and first lady what is right and what is wrong, which has been a
problem for many of the Clintonistas around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If he
is not heeded, he can walk away, and that would mean real trouble.
By midweek it was impossible for a pundit not to have an opinion about
Hillary. Some tried to have it every which way. Ted Koppel, cerebral host of
ABC's 'Nightline,' declared: 'There is no doubt many of those who oppose the
health plan are only too happy to see Mrs Clinton distracted and weakened by
the Whitewater fiasco. But that doesn't mean the criticism is inappropriate,
unjustified or unworthy of a straightforward answer.'
Anna Quindlen, the New York Times columnist, thought the president came
perilously close to a 'little woman' defence of his wife. Her ironical
conclusion was this: 'Hillary Clinton will once more break new ground, this
time as a presidential adviser-spouse in the midst of a political maelstrom.
It will take a great mind to determine how to play this out. Luckily we have
a great mind in the White House. Unfortunately, she's the one most involved
in the mess.'
In this maelstrom, not many things are certain any more. Some now seem
irrelevant - that, for example, Mrs Clinton is a person of exceptional
intelligence and qualifications with a long-standing interest in the policy
issues that drive her husband's administration. This may puzzle Europeans
accustomed to invisible political spouses, but until she became such a
Whitewater target this week, most Americans were comfortable that her policy
wings had not been clipped.
Second, and perhaps less well appreciated, is that for most of their
marriage she has been the principal breadwinner, earning, as a legal star,
many times his governor's salary. She, like many modern American women, ran
their investments. None of his Arkansas enemies have ever claimed he knows
much about finance and the family.
Third, there is a well-established pattern to doing business in small
states. There will be a dominant local law firm, a leading local brokerage
and bank, and a powerful company or three, all of them accustomed to doing
business, sometimes sweetheart deals, with each other and with state
politicians. The Clintons covered most of these connections one way or
another and their state prospered, relatively, under their tutelage. On the
evidence so far presented - an important caveat given all the rumours of
smoking guns to come - Arkansas was no exception to the rule. And both
Clintons seem baffled that they should be thought to have done anything
wrong.
And they do not have the brass nerve of Orville Faubus, the Arkansas
governor of legend, who, when asked how he could afford a multi-million
dollar house when his salary had never exceeded Dollars 10,000 a year,
replied: 'I was parsimonious.' But that was Little Rock 25 years ago and
this is Washington today and the witch hunt is afoot.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (8): Making a home where the
grass is greener - Gerald Cadogan visits a farm in the Welsh hills where two
friends work hard for self-sufficiency / The Good Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marmalade and Marmite are the handsomest pigs I have seen. A dappled black
and tan breed called Oxford Sandy and Black, they are a match for that
platonic ideal of a pig, Lord Emsworth's prized Empress of Blandings in P G
Wodehouse's novels. These pigs live 800ft up a Welsh mountain in
comfortable, clean-strawed styes on a self-sufficient small farm run by
Jamie Harris and her friend Eileen Proctor.
Family or household are better words than farm. The animals are happy. Jamie
loves them and talks to them. But she is not sentimental about them. In her
freezer she keeps joints of her well-raised kid, lamb and pork. She talks
about the smallholding in the matter-of-fact way of Mediterranean peasants.
But her affection for the animals would be rare in the Mediterranean. I
found them indoors when I visited on the coldest day of the year, when even
winter coats could not survive the cut of the wind. The goats in the byre
next to the pigs nuzzled up and wanted to be scratched under the chin like
cats, used to friendly humans.
The goats were striking breeds: two Swiss Tottenbergs, the third - Marina -
an Anglo-Nubian with a big 'Roman' nose who could have stepped out of an
ancient tomb painting on the banks of the Nile. She produces unusually rich,
creamy milk that Jamie turns into cheese.
Jamie is trying to find a separator to make butter and cream. These tools
have become scarce, even though not long ago most homes in Wales had one -
an indication of how the old skills of husbandry, which self-sufficiency
requires, are dying fast.
The 14-acre farm also has ducks and two donkeys - Shelley and Bruno - who
will soon be pulling a cart. 'It cuts using the car and pollution.' Six
Jacob's ewes, a tough breed suited for the Welsh hills, will be lambing
soon. Jamie spins the wool and knits gloves as uncommercial Christmas
presents - truly homespun, she says.
She has tried shearing, but 'it is hard not to cut the sheep as you dig
through 6in of fleece. They said you must keep going but I hesitated.' Now
she lets professionals do it.
The chickens are the trousery-legged Cochin breed, which Queen Victoria
introduced to Britain. They lay plenty of eggs, except in late autumn, when
their energy goes into moulting and growing new feathers. But the ducks are
pluckier, and lay all year round.
The hen houses, high off the ground, are made from old floorboards, as Jamie
believes in re-using everything. The greenhouse is made from the windows
local townspeople discarded when plastic windows came in. Twice a week,
Jamie goes to market for the old fruit and vegetables, which she boils up
for the pigs and goats.
Jamie (from Brighton) and Eileen (from South Shields) are both townies. They
were running the village post office at Cross-in-Hand in Sussex, when a
friend gave Jamie John Seymour's book on self-sufficiency. 'On down days I
found I was reading the chapter on how to keep ducks.'
They ran a wholefood restaurant in Crowborough, Sussex for a while.
Then, eight years ago, they bought Lan Farm. They paid the reserve price
after the farm failed to sell at auction. A gift of a dozen hens, who need
attention twice a day, tied them to the place immediately. After that, there
was no reason not to have other animals and learn to meet their different
demands.
As one leaves Pontypridd, and climbs up and up through the housing estates
of Graigwen the houses stop at a cattle grid. Fields begin. The farm is
close by, on top of the hill, with thrilling views and fresh air in
abundance.
'It feels so right to be here,' Jamie said. 'Putting the chickens to bed the
other night, with a glorious sunset, and thinking of the dinner, our own
potatoes and parsnips and goat, I felt quite emotional.'
The farmhouse was in rack and ruin, and had two collapsed barns when they
started. The first job was to pull the barns down. Neighbours offered help
and the names of craftsmen. 'It all just happened after that. Now we have
earned the respect of the community,' who walk past on Sunday afternoons and
can see how well run it is.
When I arrived, a tea of cheese scones, Welsh raisin cakes, soft cheese and
goat's milk fudge was waiting in the dry and spotless kitchen.
Have they found any anti-English feeling? 'This is not a second home. We
live and work here.' And anti-Englishness is less in south Wales than in mid
and north Wales, they thought.
But it is hard work. The animals are always there. And the walled garden is
demanding. The vegetables come type by type in seasonal floods, as they did
for everybody in the country in the pre-supermarket era. Now on the menu are
leeks, parsnips and potatoes.
The animals are their meat. They take them to a local butcher for slaughter.
He is only 20 minutes away and luckily still licensed.
'If the EU took his licence away, it would be a 60-minute journey. Think of
the poor animals, and the fuel and pollution.'
Are they self-sufficient? 'We are very close to it. The shopping bills are
going down.' But they cannot escape cash altogether, if only to pay the
council tax, utilities and the vet. So they take horses for summer grazing,
which helps towards repairing the gates and fences. They cannot take them in
winter as they have no stabling.
And they take guests for bed-and-breakfast - as people in Wales have been
encouraged to do after the collapse of the coal and steel industries. No
licence is needed for up to six guests, who can eat up the surplus produce.
'Bed-and-breakfast provides the cash, but it drives me potty,' Jamie said.
They have recently given up cooking dinner for the guests. After a long day
outside, it was too much. Jamie feels more and more strongly the pull of the
earth and the animals. Last summer she made an Indian-style tepee and slept
in it for three months.
They are considering selling the farm (inquiries 0443-403606). Jamie would
like to run holidays for underprivileged children, to whom she could hand on
the skills she has learned. The children would make cheese, tend the
animals, live in log cabins and learn the simple self-reliance of
self-sufficiency.
She would like to stay in Wales, a little nearer sea-level than the top of a
wind-blasted mountain, but has yet to find the place. Setting up a trust
would allow it to carry on after her time is up, she says.
What would they advise others? 'Go for it, sensibly though,' Jamie said.
'Expect a very hard life, all hours, seven days a week,' Eileen said.
Jamie continued: 'If you can't do it in the way we have, you can still make
your own bread and marmalade and cut out packaging. A lot of it is
knowledge. People think they don't know, but they can learn.'
As they have learned. You leave the farm wiser and happier. The goodness of
the earth and its produce permeates it. Look after it properly, and it will
look after you. Self-sufficiency means freedom because, whatever happens,
you have learned to cope.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wild beast's real problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PARVIZ DABIR-ALAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The gist of Angus Foster's piece ('Taming the wild beast' - March 4) is
that Brazil has had unacceptably high inflation, the Urv may force it down
but not keep it there, and the finance minister might act as kingmaker to
himself or someone else. Brazil's real problems were not mentioned, giving
the impression that the pursuit of macro-economic stability was all that is
required.
While not an insignificant ingredient of an environment which may be
conducive to growth and prosperity, macro-economic stability alone is
insufficient. Tackling a record of poor governance and facing head on the
endemic poverty of many of its citizens are among a long list of
complementary factors required. Without these, resources devoted to
achieving macro-economic stability will just be wasted.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In this age of diminished expectations, job security is a laughable
relic of a former life. We request, however, that the FT put serious
consideration to offering Mr Michael Thompson-Noel a columnist position
until the unfortunate event of his passing away.
As management students in the somewhat humourless US, we have come to rely
on his witty column every weekend as a source of unquestionable
entertainment value. His latest offering, 'Wimp of the species' (March 5),
was his best to date. As beleaguered males living in the politically
correct/feminazi world that is academia in Boston, we have finally found a
worthy and able spokesman for the endangered male species.
Hardly a day goes by that we do not thank our lucky stars that the FT and Mr
Thompson-Noel are available on this side of the pond.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Liability climbs the ladder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The weight of professional negligence claims against auditors has
finally proved too much for the Institute of Chartered Accountants
('Auditors seek to limit liability', March 3).
It certainly is unfair that in the event of company failure auditors face
the prospect of almost unlimited liability, while shareholders enjoy limited
liability and the directors appear to have hardly any liability at all.
However, in order to protect innocent creditors who may be the victims of
professional negligence, any reduction in the degree of the auditors'
liability would need to be offset by a commensurate increase in the
liabilities of the directors. This would best be achieved by the
introduction of compulsory professional indemnity insurance for all company
directors.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Legal limit of safety: The Heathrow attack has highlighted
UK security again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scenario is familiar. A spectacular IRA mortar attack - this time at
London's Heathrow airport and audaciously restaged within 36 hours -
followed by political squabbles over allegedly lax security and a further,
inevitable, tightening of anti-terrorist measures.
The republican paramilitaries have proved yet again they retain not only the
capacity to strike on the British mainland, but the capability to penetrate
the extensive and expensively constructed armour of national security.
On past form - not always a reliable guide to what it will do next - the IRA
may now be content for a while to pursue its mainland offensive via the
telephone. Which head of security will, in the days ahead, run the risk of
dismissing an anonymous message about an unspecified attack?
Whatever lies ahead, each new assault brings a fresh appraisal of existing
security and, invariably, further unwelcome restrictions on the free
movement of people going about their everyday business.
In Northern Ireland, such measures have for years formed part of the
paraphernalia employed against terrorism. But now there are road blocks in
the City of London and video cameras strung along UK high streets to monitor
the innocent and the untoward. Police go to the brink of legality
selectively to stop and search.
To minimise the ever-present terrorist threat invokes accusations, already
being bandied about by politicians yesterday, of dangerous negligence; to
implement a draconian clamp-down hands the terrorists another form of
victory.
But, beyond the rhetoric, how much more can be usefully done in a world
where home-made weaponry mounted in a Nissan Micra can thwart the best
endeavours of 1,400 airport security staff, and threaten carnage in a
supposedly high-security zone?
The battle inevitably focuses primarily on trying to identify, locate and
arrest the IRA 'volunteers' who still plan murderous attacks while their
political masters talk of peace.
The IRA has changed its internal organisation in recent years in a way that
makes it more difficult to keep track of its operations and identify its
main players. The organisation has become more decentralised with
individual, active unit 'cells' operating autonomously, so that it is less
vulnerable to penetration by the security services.
There are, of course, exceptions. In Ulster itself, the recent rate of
success against paramilitaries has been good, while another mainland bombing
campaign was halted with last month's arrests and weapons seizure in
Accrington, Lancashire.
The security services have tried to match the increasing logistical
sophistication of the IRA with their own reorganisation. Two years ago, the
government agreed that MI5, the domestic intelligence service, should
replace the Metropolitan Police in leading intelligence-gathering on the
IRA. In addition MI5 has a specific role as policy adviser to the government
on anti-terrorism.
According to security sources, the move has gone some way towards
streamlining intelligence-gathering, which was previously subject to intense
inter-service rivalries. Tensions still persist, however, in relationships
between M15 and the Metropolitan Police Special Branch - still in charge of
operations - and between the various regional police forces which are
expected to contribute their resources to localised IRA threats.
Yesterday's call by Mr David Mellor, former Home Office minister, for a
national anti-terrorist force drawing police and security forces under one
roof is not a new idea and will continue to be resisted by those jealously
guarding their own patches.
More localised initiatives have had some success. The City, shattered twice
by IRA lorry bombs in 1992 and 1993, reacted positively, if controversially,
to its own bloody experiences. Though no one will tempt fate by declaring
victory, the decision effectively to shut down core areas of the square mile
and to step up high-profile policing has, so far, had the desired effect.
After the Baltic Exchange bombing in November 1992, the City police put more
officers, including some from the CID and fraud squad, on to the streets,
while the Home Office provided more personnel. City police introduced
24-hour patrols of armed officers, who employ powers under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act to halt and question anyone they want.
In the wake of the Bishopsgate bomb in April 1993, the police worked with
the City corporation to implement the controversial road closure programme
intended to end the threat of vehicle-borne bombs. Cameras at eight entry
points record not only vehicles but passengers' faces.
But high security in one area carries the risk of terrorist activity being
transferred to another. The IRA takes a perverse pride not just in employing
new weaponry but in wrong-footing the authorities in its deadly game of cat
and mouse.
According to a City police source: 'We all recognise the danger that, in
putting up barriers, you simply shift attention to new targets. But that
doesn't mean that you can do nothing.'
Major John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert who has been advising City firms
on security in the aftermath of Bishopsgate, says permanent checkpoints are
not a solution: 'The IRA is always quick to exploit set patterns of
control.' The key to deterrence, he believes, lies in flexible controls and
improved intelligence.
The police, for good measure, would like wider powers of arrest and
detention. But everyone involved in the daily battle against terrorism will
privately admit one inalienable truth. Ultimately the answer will have to be
found by politicians and not by the forces of law and order.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Shut up' is not acceptable from a
guardian of free speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIPPE LEGRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your editorial 'Euro-babble' (March 3), I am
disappointed that a newspaper of your standing should stoop to telling the
European Union's culture and information commissioner to 'shut up'. Should a
guardian of free speech tell anyone to shut up, much less Mr Pinheiro whose
views - while different from your leader writer's - are respectable? It is
ironic that the same leader accuses Mr Pinheiro of 'an objectionable attempt
at censorship'.
On encouraging European audiovisual 'entertainment', you criticise Mr
Pinheiro's flawed proposals without suggesting alternatives. While
free-trade principles are important, films are not merely entertainment, but
also culture - and culture's value cannot be measured in purely economic
terms. If you insist on viewing it as a commodity like toothpaste, what
price do you assign to Shakespeare, national identity or freedom of
expression?

FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statutory employer funding of Tecs
needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your excellent leader comment on 'How Europe Can Compete' (March 9)
captures the essential differences between the 'Anglo-Saxon' liberal
approach towards labour market reform, and the more corporatist 'Rhine
model'. Those of us who favour the liberal approach, for its ability to
stimulate more jobs more quickly, must find ways of tackling one of its main
defects: less overall investment in skills.
It is now time for those who support Training and Enterprise Councils, and
the great steps forward that have been achieved, to recognise that Tecs have
not been radical enough. They have not brought on the new funding streams
necessary to underpin a big increase in skill levels.
The best way ahead would seem to lie through local systems of automatic
employer membership of Tecs, with all employers required to pay a
subscription to their Tec - apart from those who achieve the Investors In
People kitemark, who should be exempt.
Interestingly, this idea does not seem to provoke instant hostility among
employers in the way that national levies have done, over the years. After
all, if employers are meant to feel that they 'own' their local Tec, as
symbolised by the fact that two-thirds of the seats on boards are reserved
for the private sector, it is hardly unreasonable to expect them to pay
something towards the cost of ownership.
Statutory employer funding of Tecs could do much to help redress the UK's
chronic under-investment in skills. Coupled with strategies for encouraging
individuals to invest more in their own learning, it should now command a
wide measure of support - across the political spectrum.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Crime can make it nasty in Nice: Efforts by police and
politicians to combat Mafia infiltration along the south coast of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more ominous French words for organised crime is la pieuvre - the
octopus - and one of the more ominous fears in southern France is that its
tentacles are spreading.
Last month's gangland-style assassination of Mrs Yann Piat in the sunny
resort of Hyeres is the incident that has most shocked the French - because
she was a woman, because she was a UDF deputy in the National Assembly,
because she had the courage to campaign openly against corruption and
because she left behind a letter pointing the finger of suspicion at several
fellow-politicians if anything should befall her.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, who has promised to get to the
bottom of the affair, sent a top Paris policeman and magistrate down to
Hyeres to head a massive inquiry. Two local men have been detained, but
dozens of others have been questioned, including some of those in Mrs Piat's
letter, such as Mr Maurice Arreckx, a senator and president of the Var
department's conseil general.
It is this possibility of home-grown political involvement in the Piat
killing that probably most shocks the French. But there is a wider
international context to her death, extending right along France's southern
seaboard. In Perpignan in the west, the local procureur (prosecutor) said
recently: 'I would dearly like to put my nose into the activities of a bank
and certain businesses based in a newly independent state bordering the
eastern Pyrenees', by which he meant Andorra. To the east, hard by the
Italian border, the city of Menton now routinely insists that Italians
wanting to buy a business or develop real estate produce a certificate from
the Italian authorities showing they are clean of the Mafia.
This week, top French and Italian investigators met to exchange information
on fighting organised crime. They gathered in Aix-en-Provence, whose
procureur general, Mr Claude Salavagione, warned publicly in January that
'Mafioso penetration is not just in drugs, but in all sectors'. This was
indeed the theme of a report last year by a National Assembly committee on
which Mrs Piat sat.
The report urged that France should act before the Mafia took deep root on
its mainland, as it has done in Corsica, where there have been 11
assassinations this year. But it spoke of 'worrying signs of a growing Mafia
presence in France', citing a few instances of its involvement in casinos in
the south-east, golf clubs in the Var and the Alpes of Haut Provence, and
more generally in real estate.
Perhaps its most disquieting revelation concerned the poor response of banks
in France's south-east to a 1992 decree requiring them to report suspicions
about drug-money passing through their vaults to a body within the finance
ministry in Paris, called Tracfin. 'Since February 1992, Tracfin has
received about 40 declarations of suspicions a month, which is few compared
with the thousand which Scotland Yard processes monthly,' the report said,
adding that it was astonished that 'the share of declarations of suspicions
coming from banks in the south-east was virtually nil'. Part of this is
because of the lack of any formal co-operation from Monaco.
Only one French city, however, pins its problems solely on the Italian
Mafia. This is Menton, where the mayor, Mr Jean-Claude Guibal, had the
effrontery in 1989 to refuse to let an Italian company manage the municipal
casino. 'We lived through hell,' says an aide to Mr Guibal. 'Our children
were threatened, we found crushed birds on our doorsteps, and a wheel came
unstuck when the mayor was driving his car.' After a tip-off from Paris in
1990 that the Mafia might try to take by force what it could not by
intimidation, the mayor ordered the casino surrounded by municipal garbage
trucks. Now the casino has a French manager and the city is calm, but the
mayor's office say it faces constant pressure from Mafia attempts to buy and
develop local real estate.
Further west along the Cote d'Azur, there are countervailing fiefdoms
keeping direct Mafia influence at bay. This was certainly true of Nice while
the Medecin family reigned in its hotel de ville. This long reign came to an
end in 1990 when Mr Jacques Medecin fled to Uruguay, where he is now
appealing against an extradition order to face tax and corruption charges
back home. But though a prison, a police station and a tax office were
mysteriously bombed in January 1993, the city remains relatively free of the
Mafia.
Certainly, Mr Jacques Peyrat believes so. He has no reason to do the Nice
political establishment any favours. He is running as the Front National
candidate in tomorrow's final round of voting in a Nice parliamentary
by-election, against the Gaullist mayor, Mr Jean-Paul Barety. Among the
charges levelled against the FN by its opponents, corruption does not
figure; by almost never gaining power, the FN (to which Mrs Piat once
belonged) has never sullied its hands in this way.
'I am certainly calling for a clean sweep in Nice,' Mr Peyrat says, noting
allegations by local Socialist councillors of impropriety by the mayor's
running mate, Mr Bruno Miraglia, in land dealings. Mr Miraglia denies any
wrongdoing. 'But this has nothing to do with the Mafia, who might have some
residences in Nice but have never tried to grab power here,' adds Mr Peyrat.
However, he sees real estate temptations for all concerned as Nice expands.
Growth has certainly brought graft to the Var department, now dubbed the
'Var West'. Once a rural backwater between Nice and Marseille, tourism has
given the department the second-fastest population increase in France.
Hyeres is much changed from the quiet resort described in Simenon's 1952
book Mon Ami, Maigret; it has had three murders and half a dozen bombings in
the past two years.
Mrs Piat had apparently intended to make opposition on environmental grounds
to full-scale development of the town's Giens peninsula a feature of her
campaign for the mairie next year. But the Var chamber of commerce, based in
Toulon, says her assassination is 'catastrophic' for the image of the
region, to which it has been trying to attract new industry to offset
shipbuilding's decline.
One theory is that Mrs Piat may have been killed in revenge for her alleged
involvement, perhaps with rival Marseille gangsters, in the assassination a
year ago in Italy of Mr Jean-Louis Fargette, a Toulon underworld figure.
Many Var politicians turned out for Mr Fargette's funeral, at which the
priest said: 'He forgot certain moral values, but I know he would never
touch drugs or prostitution out of respect for his mother.' Mr Fargette
figured in Mrs Piat's 1992 letter, as did Mr Arreckx and his departmental
vice-president, Mr Joseph Sercia, both of whom have been interrogated by
police.
UDF, the centre-right federation, is strong along the south coast. Mr
Arreckx and Mr Sercia belong to it - as does Mr Francois Leotard, the
defence minister, who has had to weather allegations of real estate
impropriety in his mayoralty of Frejus - and both men see in their police
interrogation a bid by Mr Pasqua's RPR Gaullists to discredit its coalition
partner and even the notion of decentralisation.
Certainly, the past 10 years of decentralisation have placed temptation in
the way of French regional and city bosses. It has boosted their budgets
(the Var's rose by 25 per cent over 1990-93) and powers to award contracts.
But reversing this is probably politically impossible and democratically
undesirable. Mr Francois d'Aubert, a UDF deputy and chief author of the 1993
Mafia report, believes regions or cities with political leaders who are
involved in corruption should be put under temporary direct rule from Paris.
Such an idea goes too far, says an aide of Mayor Guibal. But he suggests
that the interior ministry should provide cities like Menton with speedier
intelligence on doubtful applicants for city building permits.
Yet he concedes there are some requests that Paris cannot meet. 'We recently
received an application from an Italian company for a construction licence,
but the ministry has told us that the company has 300 partners and they
cannot possibly check all of these for Mafioso connections.
'Of course, the company will give us an anti-Mafia certificate, but that may
not prove much. So we'll just play for time, insist that their proposed
doors are 50cm too narrow or too wide, and eventually they will abandon the
project.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (7): A stress-free way of
finding a home - The advantages of professional home searchers / Relocation
agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relocation (or buying) agents appeared in the 1980s - after gazumping but
before negative equity. Part of their job is to prevent gazumping and
negotiate prices down. That automatically deters property inflation. Their
main function is to find and buy houses and flats.
At the end of the process, the service should have made clear to a client
all the pros and cons of the homes on their shortlist.
They charge a fee. But as they negotiate with the vendor's estate agent,
they can produce larger reductions on the selling price than the individual
buyer could achieve.
Add an immeasurable saving in hassle and family stress, and buying agents
can prove worthwhile.
If you want an expensive standard item, such as a flat in Knightsbridge,
central London, but find it daunting to work through the estate agents'
lists, then a buying agent will do the hard work, study the lists and
traipse around town to find a place to suit you and your way of life.
Buying agents create a level playing field in the game of winning a new
nest. With their help it can become an emotion-free commercial deal. And
when it is a matter of saying 'no', you have a third party to do it for you.
For example, flats and family houses are a routine request for London
company Property Vision.
If you are famous or rich, or both, an extra advantage is that the vendor
and his agent will not need to know your name until a deal is settled.
A buying agent starts by learning as much as possible about you and your
family and where you aspire to live.
A visit to your existing home is essential, unless you are overseas. The
agent sees how you live and what you want to improve on in a new home.
Expatriates should provide as much information as possible.
Then comes the search. Bedrock International starts in the office, sitting
you in front of a screen for a computerised armchair tour. You call up
pictures of possible properties and see if they appeal. Another plus is that
buying agents can often find properties that have not been put up for public
sale. Property Vision calls it 'the invisible market'.
Keeping an ear to the ground, the agents hear of houses that owners are
reluctant to admit to having to sell. Why? Perhaps because of two of the
property world's Three Ds, debt and divorce (the third is death).
Rupert Bradstock, of Property Vision, suggests that some owners, worried
about market conditions, did not want to risk their houses failing to sell
and thus going stale. His company bought more than Pounds 17m worth of
country houses last year, 53 per cent of them invisibly.
Last year's coup for Wilson  Wilson was to buy Doddington Park, a stately
home in Gloucestershire. Charterhouse International, a young company in
Bath, secured a whole crescent house in Bath (1 Cavendish Crescent) with an
offer close to the asking price of Pounds 275,000, which it now manages for
its clients after supervising the restoration.
Another success was The Moot House, at Downton, in Wiltshire, built in 1650,
listed Grade I and on the market at Pounds 650,000.
Peter Lewis, Stacks' man in Dorset, had a red letter day when he bought an
old rectory from a vendor one morning and, in the evening, bought another
old rectory at auction for that morning's vendor.
How did he hear of the first house? 'Contacts, local knowledge, you know,'
he said.
The searches lead to a shortlist, on which the buying agent can give a full
and frank report on the properties.
That is useful as information in brochures becomes thinner, as Tad
Zurlinden, of the Association of Relocation Agents, points out. The agent
will also advise on schools, golf clubs, hunts, shops and all other local
matters, and will know a surveyor to call on quickly.
The buyer then visits the properties with the agent, possibly without the
vendor being present. All that remains is to make a choice and instruct the
agent to make an offer and negotiate.
It is no surprise that buying agents occasionally end up as friends of their
clients. After holding their hands (figuratively) and discovering what they
think really matters (which takes time to learn), they come to know them
well.
Fees are in two parts. A preliminary retainer pays for the agent's
out-of-pocket expenses, and shows that you are serious and will commit
yourself, acting fast if need be. If it has a limited term, an extension may
be negotiable. Wilson  Wilson's retainer is Pounds 750, Stacks' Pounds 400
and Property Vision's Pounds 1,000. Add VAT to all sums.
Once the deal has been agreed, the retainer is usually set against the main
fee which is a percentage of the buying price, and often 1.5 or 2 per cent,
sometimes 2.5 per cent. The Property Service in London charges 1 per cent
with a minimum charge of Pounds 2,000. For a truly expensive property, you
may be able to elicit a discount.
County Homesearch has a variation. It charges the greater of 1 per cent of
the buying price or 15 per cent of the saving negotiated between the asking
price and the buying price.
'It is an incentive for us to find our clients the right property at the
right price,' the company says.
Property Vision will negotiate with the vendor's agent for a property the
client has found on his own for 1.5 per cent.
Buying agents must be prepared to advise a client not to proceed if the
property is in the wrong place or is too expensive. 'Some clients need the
sergeant major's approach,' Zurlinden says. 'It means they do not waste
their money.'
If a house on the invisible market costs too much, Property Vision advises
clients to wait until the owner puts it on the open market.
In the 1980s, when plenty of property was for sale, relocation agents helped
private buyers. In the recession they found themselves working for companies
that were moving and needed to rehouse their staff - the sort of task that
Hambros Countrywide Relocation specialises in - and were successful in
pushing down prices.
Last year, private buyers started to return. But it has been a thin market.
Too few houses have been offered publicly. This has been the best test of
the agents' power to search in the invisible market. ARA (031-558-3060) is a
professional body that issues a directory listing members' areas of
expertise. Groups covering much of the country that are members include
County Homesearch (0872-223349) and Stacks (0666-860523). ARA members
include disgruntled estate agents, converted to the other side, former
teachers, former army officers and surveyors. But many companies are not
members, including Charterhouse International in Bath (0225-482727) and
chains such as Black Horse and Nationwide.
London-based companies such as Bedrock International (071-351-2625), The
Property Service (071351-6552), Property Vision (071-602-8788) and Wilson 
Wilson (071-727-1977) also see no need to join ARA, nor do the buying
departments of the major national estate agents - who will be glad to act
but may refrain from buying a house their company is selling, to avoid
conflict of interest.

FT  12 MAR 94 / No no no, Minister: Strains between the civil service and
its political bosses seem sharper then ever before. John Willman examines
why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Whitehall's village, the bush telegraph is humming. Top mandarins are
said to be falling out with their ministers. Civil service morale is
described as being at an all-time low. Turf wars are breaking out between
rival UK government departments.
This is hardly surprising given the radical civil service reforms the
government is pushing through. But the strife extends to the politicians.
Parts of the government machine are reportedly paralysed by ministerial
indecision. Ministers are accused by some civil servants of spending more
time jostling for position in the race to replace Mr John Major than reading
the red boxes packed with papers needing their urgent attention.
There is certainly evidence of unhappiness among permanent secretaries, the
grade 1 civil servants in charge of departments. Two have retired early in
recent months, amid rumours of clashes with their political masters.
In November, Sir Geoffrey Holland announced his departure from the
Department for Education after barely 10 months in the post. At 55 and after
a glittering career as head of, first, the Manpower Services Commission and,
then, the Department of Employment, he was leaving Whitehall to become
vice-chancellor of Exeter university.
'He jumped with a golden umbrella and a big smile on his face,' a spokesman
for the Department for Education suggested. Others were less sanguine: it
was widely reported that he had fallen out with Mr John Patten, the
education secretary. 'Either he goes or I do,' he is rumoured to have told
colleagues.
It is improbable that such a polished performer said anything of the sort.
But there was a problem over rapport, with Sir Geoffrey said to be
frustrated at the inability of Mr Patten to think big. Too much time was
spent fire-fighting, dealing with problems over issues such as school
testing that many in the department felt were self-induced.
This week, Sir Clive Whitmore, top man at the Home Office, confirmed he was
also off before retirement age. His imminent move to an unspecified
'well-paid' job in the private sector was linked with reports of friction in
the department between civil servants and Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary.
Unlike Sir Geoffrey, Sir Clive circulated a memo to his officials denying a
rift with his secretary of state. But there is no doubting the unhappiness
among many senior Home Office mandarins over the home secretary's robust
approach to law and order. They see the rapidly increasing prison population
as a policy designed to strengthen Mr Howard's claims in a future Tory
leadership battle. That he has not been willing to listen to their
objections - or study evidence suggesting the policy will be an expensive
failure - adds insult to injury.
'I can't understand why Clive hasn't exploded in public instead of simply
retiring,' says one a seasoned Whitehall watcher.
Morale is also said to be low among civil servants at the environment
department. Their secretary of state, Mr John Gummer, recently made a
much-publicised conversion to the Roman Catholic church after the Church of
England decided to ordain women.
Mr Gummer was already in his officials' bad books after last year's public
expenditure battle when he conceded cuts in his budget of more than Pounds
1bn. He is now condemned by senior mandarins for what they regard as an
unforgivable sin: his alleged reluctance to read briefs. Departmental
business has ground to a halt, they say, as he wrestles with his conscience
over matters spiritual.
Elsewhere in Whitehall, there is a struggle for turf over the new job
seeker's allowance for the unemployed, to be introduced in 1996. Merging
unemployment benefit and income support for the jobless will cost thousands
of civil service jobs. The Department of Social Security believes its
Benefits Agency should pay the new allowance. The employment department says
job seekers are the province of the Employment Service which runs programmes
to help the unemployed back into work.
A similar battle can be expected over proposals to merge the Inland Revenue
and Customs and Excise, revealed in yesterday's FT. These two Treasury
departments are unlikely to surrender their independence without a fight.
And the interminable tug of war continues over responsibility for training.
The Departments of Trade and Industry, Education and Employment are all
unwilling to give up their share of this market.
Even the Foreign Office, under the unflappable Mr Douglas Hurd, is not
immune from fear and loathing. An unprecedented meeting of London-based
staff was summoned in January to hear the foreign secretary try to soothe
fears on the future of the diplomatic service.
'There is an awful lot of turbulence around,' according to a civil servant
in charge of an executive agency. 'Ministers haven't got their act together.
'The thrashing around gets back to senior colleagues who are becoming very
concerned. It all creates great uncertainty.'
That uncertainty is amplified by the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq
scandal, which has sent a frisson through Whitehall. The public
interrogation of senior civil servants by Lord Justice Scott and Ms Presiley
Baxendale, his steely counsel, has set what many see as a dangerous
precedent.
'It came as a great shock to learn that ministers' private memos could be
produced in court,' says one grade 3 civil servant in charge of a policy
area in a large department. 'It's much harder to get decisions out of
ministers now. They are no longer willing to commit their thoughts to paper,
and delay everything for meetings.'
Whoever is responsible for current indecision and delays, mandarins have
long griped about the shortcomings of their political masters in their Pall
Mall clubs.
Professor Peter Hennessy, the Whitehall historian, quotes the example of Mr
George Turner, a permanent secretary at the wartime Ministry of Supply, who
was prone to describe the department's ministers as 'our two parliamentary
liabilities downstairs'. Neither of the ministers in question could be
called political slouches: Mr Harold Macmillan went on to become prime
minister, while Mr Duncan Sandys had a distinguished cabinet career and was
colonial secretary.
That the standard moans have become louder is seen by many as a consequence
of the reforms imposed on the civil service since Mrs Thatcher came to power
in 1979. Civil servants have had to digest manpower cuts, privatisations,
the creation of more than 80 agencies to deliver services, the Citizen's
Charter and pay freezes.
The most hated reform has been market-testing, the programme under which
civil servants must compete for their own jobs against bidders from the
private sector.
'The civil service has traditionally been regarded as an unrisky
profession,' says Ms Kate Jenkins, a former high-flying civil servant, now a
consultant on public service reform. 'Now it has been involuntarily exposed
to risk in a way that civil servants would not have expected when they
joined the service.'
The standard civil service response under such an onslaught is the sort of
backchat and griping that is now the dominant signal on the Whitehall bush
telegraph. Another is foot-dragging, which has been clearly visible in the
slow progress over the first 18 months of market-testing.
Figures this week from the Cabinet Office show that several departments have
yet to finish half the market-testing programme that should have been
completed by the end of last September. They include Social Security, Trade
and Industry, Education and the Lord Chancellor's department.
Embarrassingly, the Treasury, guardian of the nation's purse, is also among
the laggards. And the Office of Public Service and Science, the Cabinet
Office division in charge of Whitehall reform, has barely done better, with
just over half its programme finished.
The final straw for many mandarins has been the recent report from the
Cabinet Office efficiency unit on top appointments in the civil service.
'It talks about opening up the top jobs to outsiders, advertising all posts
and introducing contracts of service,' says one aggrieved civil servant.
'It's all very unsettling.'
These sentiments might easily be put down to fears that promotion would be
blocked by such measures. Yet this civil servant is of an age when he has no
further career ambitions. His concern is over the effect on those further
down the ladder who will see the best jobs awarded to people brought in from
the private sector.
Ministers' tendency to denigrate the civil service exacerbates these fears,
says a former civil servant who is now a public sector consultant with a
large accountancy firm.
'Ministers have this ethos that there's nothing very good about the civil
service,' he says. 'They neglect its strengths - the collegiate approach in
which no decision is taken without consulting a wide range of people and
thinking through long-term consequences.'
'Politicians no longer see civil servants as professional advisers,' says
another ex-civil servant. 'Increasingly they treat them as gophers.'
Prof Hennessy sees this mishandling of the civil service as a reflection of
the decline of the British political class. 'Civil servants always like
working for the big figures like Willie (Lord Whitelaw) and Dennis (Lord
Healey). They're even quite fond of current grandees such as Douglas Hurd
and Michael Heseltine. It's the meagre placemen they don't like, the
small-minded ideologues who have risen without trace.'
Civil servants have also been wrong-footed by the unexpected radicalism of
Mr Major on civil service reform, according to Mr Graham Mather, president
of the European Policy Forum, the independent think-tank.
'They had expected things to calm down after Mrs Thatcher went, and they
haven't'
Since Mr Major shows no signs of abating his radicalism in this policy area,
the hard times look set to continue. Expect more grumbling on the Whitehall
grapevine, and further premature departures from the ranks of Britain's top
mandarins.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Leading Article: George fires a warning shot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is flexing its muscles. The annual rate of UK economic
growth could rise to as much as 3 per cent over the next 18 months to two
years and needs no 'artificial' stimulus, predicted the governor, Mr Eddie
George, in the US on Thursday. Earlier in the week, his deputy, Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea said that it was 'a delusion' to think that the UK had defeated
inflation.
Arriving in Detroit for the jobs summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries next Monday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will be
cheered by the Bank's views on the strength of the recovery back home. But
he will also find it more difficult to make a case for cutting interest
rates, should he wish to do so.
Evidence from the first of this month's batch of economic statistics would
seem to bear out the Bank's optimism. Figures published last week showed
that manufacturing output increased by 1.1 per cent in January, a much
larger rise than was expected, while December's drop was revised to just 0.2
per cent. Housing starts rose by an annual rate of 16 per cent in the three
months to January, although from a low base. Government estimates of net
lending to consumers in January showed a sharp drop from December 1993. But
figures from the Finance and Leasing Association, which are taken from a
wider base, disclosed a 37 per cent year-on-year rise in gross lending
between January 1993 and January 1994.
The sharp rise in bond yields witnessed in recent weeks suggests that
investors in bonds share the optimism over growth. Yields on 10-year gilts
now stand a little under a percentage point higher than at the beginning of
the year. The rise in the yield on index-linked gilts implies that about
half of this increase is due to higher real interest rates. The remainder is
due to a rise in inflationary expectations. Both presumably reflect greater
confidence about the prospects for economic growth, partly worldwide, but
partly also in the UK.
Strong demand
Yesterday's trade figures confirm the picture of strong demand. The surge in
imports in December, and upward revisions to the trade deficit for the whole
of last year, also rekindle fears that the UK economy will suck in imports
and run into balance of payments problems, as it starts growing reasonably
rapidly. The rise in manufacturing output gives some reason to be optimistic
on this score, however, since manufactures constitute such a large
proportion of the country's traded goods.
The output figures also show that production of investment goods rose by
nearly 4 per cent in January, while that of consumer goods fell slightly.
There may be evidence here of a shift towards investment-led growth,
essential if a rapid recovery is to prove sustainable.
Nevertheless, what is happening to consumption will be of more immediate
interest to Mr Clarke as he contemplates the effect the imminent tax rises
may have on the economy. Consumer expenditure grew at an annual rate of 3.2
per cent in the final quarter of last year, which confirms that personal
consumption, much the biggest component of demand, is the driving force
behind the recovery. But the measures announced by Mr Clarke and his
predecessor Mr Lamont in last year's two budgets represent a net fiscal
adjustment of Pounds 12.8bn. The tax bill of a married man on average
earnings will be Pounds 12.50 a month heavier after April.
Reduced savings
Taxpayers' disposable incomes are going to be hit hard, as the Labour party
has delighted in pointing out. If the consumer-led recovery is not going to
grind to a halt, consumers will have to reduce their rate of savings. In
fact, they have already begun to do so. The savings rate fell from a peak of
13 per cent in the middle of 1992, to 10.6 per cent in the third quarter of
1993. But if real consumer expenditure is to continue growing at 2.5 per
cent a year at a time of stagnant real disposable incomes, the savings rate
will need to fall to 6 per cent by the end of 1995.
The consensus is growing among commentators, including the chancellor's own
panel of independent forecasters, that the recovery should survive the
increased tax burden. Needless to say, there are also dissenting voices who
refuse to accept that the savings rate is set to decline so sharply.
Unemployment needs to continue its decline if the precautionary element in
savings is to fall. House prices, which rose 3.8 per cent in February, will
also have to recover still further if consumers are to feel confident about
their wealth.
Despite these doubts, it would be a brave chancellor who ignored the
outspoken comments of the governor of the Bank of England. It seems
increasingly likely that policymakers will wait until the effects of next
month's tax rises become evident before deciding whether to make further
changes in interest rates. Moreover, the next move in interest rates may not
be downwards.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Man in the News: Sacrificial spirit of devotion - Wei
Jingsheng
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, has been cooling his heels
this week in a small inn in the bleak port city of Tianjin about an hour's
drive south-east of Beijing.
It is a moot point whether Wei is under arrest or under surveillance, but
his movements have been severely curtailed while Mr Warren Christopher, the
US secretary of state, is in Beijing this weekend.
Thus, in feudal tradition a naysayer has been banished from the capital to
spare China's rulers a troublesome presence. Chinese history is replete with
such examples. Wei's treatment is a reminder that even in the country's
modernisation phase, official behaviour sometimes owes more to the past than
to the present.
The 44-year-old Wei was reported by his secretary to be in good spirits. For
someone who emerged last year from more than 14 years in jail, including a
stint in a penal colony in remote and harsh Qinghai province, his temporary
'exile' in Tianjin must seem like a mild inconvenience.
Not that Wei, the former Red Guard and People's Liberation Army soldier is
likely to be much fazed whatever his circumstances. Suggestions that he had
suffered a mental breakdown while in jail proved unfounded. 'My will was
strengthened and so was my determination to increase people's awareness of
democracy,' he told the Financial Times recently.
Wei may not have the international stature of a Sakharov, the Soviet nuclear
scientist condemned to internal exile during the Brezhnev years, but in the
Chinese context he is a central figure as the unofficial 'leader' of a tiny,
fragmented dissident community.
Chinese official nervousness of Wei's ability to use an occasion such as Mr
Christopher's visit to amplify his call for political freedom both at home
and abroad is perhaps not surprising.
Fresh in Chinese memory is the embarrassing row that marred President George
Bush's visit to Beijing in 1989 - months before the Tiananmen square
massacre - after moves by the authorities to prevent the dissident Professor
Fang Lizhi from attending a presidential banquet.
That episode, perhaps more than any other, rendered Prof Fang a dissident
hero in his own country, and gave him exceptional prominence
internationally. He was exiled to the US in 1990 and has become a remote
figure to his countrymen.
However, lao Wei (old Wei) as he is known in the dissident community, has
remained close to his roots, and since his release from jail last September
has continued to press his views among his fellow dissidents and in
conversations with journalists and diplomats.
Western officials say that it would be a mistake to exaggerate Wei's
political importance in a country where the few dissenting voices are barely
heard above a whisper; but equally he could become a 'rallying point' in a
time of crisis.
Wei's dissident colleagues make no attempt to hide their admiration for his
commitment and sacrifice. Liu Xiaobo, one of the leaders, or so-called
'black hands', behind the pro-democracy protests of 1989, says: 'He is one
of the few democracy fighters to devote himself totally to the cause. If you
don't have such a spirit of devotion you can't survive very long in such a
totalitarian system.'
Wei cannot be faulted for lack of staying power. He first came to notice in
1978 during the brief Beijing political spring as perhaps the most literate
of the pro-democracy activists who made their voices heard in big-character
posters pasted on the grimy wall of a Beijing bus station on the city's main
boulevard.
His most enduring testament and one that angered Deng Xiaoping was a poster
entitled 'The Fifth Modernisation', which appeared on 'Democracy Wall' on
December 5 1978. This was a cheeky play on the 'four modernisations'
campaign embraced by the Communist party a month or so previously, which had
pointedly excluded any reference to political liberalisation.
'What is true democracy?' Wei had asked rhetorically. 'It means the right of
people to choose their own representatives who will work according to their
will and in their interests. Only this can be called democracy.'
These views were a deep affront to Communist rulers emerging from the years
of chaos of the Cultural Revolution. Their misgivings were compounded when
Wei dared to suggest in contributions to the underground magazine,
Exploration, that the Communist party itself had failed, and, worse, that
Deng himself had a flawed appreciation of China's needs.
This was too much for Mr Deng, who has never shown much squeamishness about
dealing with dissent. In the spring of 1979, Wei was sentenced to 15 years
in jail for leaking military secrets to a foreign journalist and for
counter-revolutionary activities.
The penalties seemed excessive, even by the standards of the time, and Wei's
incarceration proved a blight on China's reputation throughout the 1980s.
His release last September, six months before his jail term expired, on the
eve of the vote awarding the 2000 Olympics to Sydney, was a crude attempt to
boost China's chances of hosting the games.
Whatever Wei's feelings about being used as a pawn in the Olympics chess
game, he showed quickly that he had lost none of his appetite for
controversy. He dared the Communist party to meet the challenge of change.
'China is changing, so how can the Communist party remain unchanged?' he
asked reporters. 'The question is whether that change can keep up with the
pace of change in society. If it can't, then I'm afraid what has happened in
the Soviet Union and eastern Europe will happen here. People will rise up
and topple the government and then there will be turmoil.
'I hope party members will be wise enough to keep pace with the wishes of
the people and thus achieve a smooth transition.'
With Mr Deng slipping away, and with Wei in reasonably good health in spite
of his long ordeal, it is just possible that China's leading dissident may
have the last word.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Hurd warns of big gains by Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned Conservatives yesterday that
the Liberal Democrats could gain significantly in the forthcoming European
and local elections.
His warning that the Liberal Democrats would benefit from public cynicism
about politics was part of a strong Tory offensive against the party, which
was gathering in Cardiff last night for a spring policy conference.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, meanwhile accused the
Conservatives of distorting his party's long-standing commitment to European
federalism - Liberal Democrat support for a federal Europe is expected to be
confirmed by the conference tomorrow.
Delegates will vote on a resolution calling for 'a united Europe which is
democratic, decentralised and diverse: a federal Europe' and which says the
European Union should confine its activities to 'a limited range of big
issues where European institutions are clearly effective'.
This is in line with recent efforts by party leaders to play down the
federal issue in the light of public hostility to Europe. The resolution
envisages transferring powers over large areas of the economy, the
environment and employment to Brussels, however.
Mr Ashdown said the Conservative party had perverted the meaning of the word
federalism by pretending that it implied a more centralised Europe, with
greater powers exercised from Brussels.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president, said people were 'far
less sceptical about Europe than most Tories believe'.
Mr Hurd told Conservatives in his Oxfordshire constituency of Witney that a
'general suspicion of politics and politicians' had undermined governing
parties in Canada, Italy, Japan, Germany and the US.
'A party of protest without hope of government sometimes fares better in
this situation than the official opposition,' Mr Hurd said. 'Hence the
success in by-elections of the Liberal Democrats, who confuse and contradict
themselves at every turn.'
Mr Hurd said the Tories would overcome this problem by maintaining the
economic recovery and making the public see that it was under way. He warned
that Conservatives would have to struggle against an 'increasingly hostile
press which is remarkably sensitive at any criticism of itself'.
The ministerial offensive against the Liberal Democrats was joined by Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr William Waldegrave, public
service minister, who attacked the party's defence and economic policies.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Liberal Democrat spring policy conference opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1,300 delegates at the Liberal Democrat spring policy conference will
debate a range of initiatives designed to set the stage for the
parliamentary, local and European elections in the next three months, Kevin
Brown writes.
Debates on issues such as the inner cities, homelessness, social policy and
prostitution are intended to sharpen the party's urban image for a battle
with the Tories for inner-city and European seats.
Party leaders acknowledge that the test will be the Eastleigh by-election
caused by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP. The party
believes it can win the seat, which would guarantee a high profile in the
European elections in June.
But Liberal Democrat strategists believe that the government may hold the
by-election as early as mid-April in an effort to catch the opposition
parties off guard.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Quicker land searches urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for councils to handle standard land-search inquiries from
prospective homebuyers within 10 working days was made yesterday by Mr John
Gummer, environment secretary.
Mr Gummer, speaking to the Council of Mortgage Lenders as the Department of
the Environment published a consultation paper on plans to make this
mandatory, urged councils to bring in the standard voluntarily before
legislation was introduced.
The proposals include making councils refund all or part of the fee if they
fail to deal with the inquiry within the time limit.
Mr Gummer said the government's aim was to 'ensure that delays with searches
do not emerge again when the housing market picks up'.
Replies to the consultation paper are wanted by early May, but there is no
certainty that the necessary legislation would be included even in the
parliamentary session of 1994-95.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chairman of the CML, reiterated the organisation's
opposition to more cuts in mortgage interest tax relief. He said further
reductions could lead to more repossessions.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Privacy law delayed by doubts over right to sue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to introduce privacy legislation face further delay because
of doubts about how best to create a right to sue for breach of privacy.
It could be summer before a long-expected white paper is published, nearly a
year after it was first promised.
The white paper, which was due to be published later this month, has been
delayed because of the concern of Mr John Major and ministers about the
section creating a new tort - or civil wrong - of breach of privacy.
The main issue causing difficulty is how to make the right to sue available
to everyone. Failure to do so could call into question the wisdom of
introducing the tort while creating a bonanza for lawyers protecting the
privacy of the rich and famous.
A meeting involving all the government departments involved, ranging from
National Heritage and the Lord Chancellor's Department to the Home Office
and Downing Street, will be called to resolve the remaining difficulty.
The National Heritage Department said yesterday the white paper was unlikely
to be published until after Easter.
The government is determined to push ahead with introducing criminal
offences covering electronic eavesdropping or using long-range lenses to
take pictures on private property. The offences, outlined in the Calcutt
report, would apply to everyone and not just journalists.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Phone watchdog levies record fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company raising money for children's charities has been fined Pounds
90,000 by Icstis, the telecoms industry regulator, for running a
'misleading' premium-rate telephone competition.
The fine is the largest in the watchdog's eight-year history.
The Children's Support Foundation, a Birmingham-based company trading under
the name Lucky Numbers, advertised holiday prizes, including weeks in
Florida and Tenerife.
Readers were invited to phone an 0891 premium-rate number - paying 48p a
minute at peak rate and 36p a minute off-peak - to find out details. In fact
the prizes were highly conditional, in some cases involving winners buying
flights and/or accommodation.
Icstis received a flood of complaints about the competition. It said
yesterday that the fine took account of the call revenue made by the service
as well as the seriousness of the case. Baroness Dean, Icstis chairman, said
it was 'a clear-cut and serious case of the public being misled'. The fine
was intended to defer other companies seeking to 'hoodwink the public'.
Children's Support Foundation, which described itself as a non-profit-making
company raising money for registered children's charities, reacted angrily.
Ms Stephanie Weightman, a director, said competitors were not obliged to
phone the premium-rate number but could have participated by post. 'There
was no intention to mislead,' she said. 'We believe we are being made an
example of.'
Icstis is better known for its campaign against premium-rate telephone sex
lines, which British Telecom agreed to curb last year. However, it is
increasingly concerned at abuse of premium-rate lines for fraudulent
competitions and advertisements.
The Children's Support Foundation was using premium-rate numbers supplied by
Telephone International Media, one of 300 providers of premium-rate numbers.
Mr David Redmile, managing director of TIM, said he had checked the bona
fides of CSF before agreeing to issue numbers. He said it appeared to be
raising funds for charity and had offered previous phone competitions
without complaints.
Although Icstis is not a statutory body, it is recognised by BT and other
telecoms operators. Suppliers of premium-rate services are obliged to abide
by its code of practice.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Smith contemptuous of 'punch-drunk' Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday delivered a contemptuous attack
on the Conservative government, saying it had run out of imagination and
energy and was kept going only by its desire to stay in office.
He told the annual conference of the Labour party in Scotland at Dundee that
the government was like 'a punch-drunk boxer, kept going only by his desire
to stay on his feet'.
It was almost impossible to find a leading Tory who was not preparing for a
leadership contest, he said. 'Whether the prime minister likes it or not,
every speech by leading cabinet ministers is now scrutinised for signs of
whether or not that particular minister is trying to improve his chances of
succeeding Mr Major.'
He said government priorities were dictated by the odds one could get on the
leadership prospects of Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine and 'the
fading Michael Howard.'
In a reference to last week's clear-out of much of the board of Celtic
football club in Glasgow, he said: 'While ministers scurry around trying to
prepare for a boardroom coup, don't they understand that the country doesn't
care who the managing director is? The country doesn't want a boardroom
coup. From everywhere comes a stronger and more familiar cry - sack the
board.'
Mr Smith attacked the government's bill for reforming local government in
Scotland, which is in its committee stage in the Commons.
He said the bill had 'shambolic proposals' which were drawn up not by an
independent government commission but by 'Tory ministers sitting down with a
map and pencil and drawing up the boundaries' to make sure there was as much
Tory blue as possible on the political map.
He said the establishment of a Scottish parliament was unfinished business
for him, because he had been the minister responsible for devolution in the
last Labour government.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Savings bond attracts Pounds 480m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of the most recent National Savings product - the guaranteed income
bond for pensioners - drew in Pounds 480m last month, accounting for the
bulk of National Savings' net contribution to government funding last month
of Pounds 775m.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said he was pleased with the 'excellent'
result. 'I am delighted that so many pensioners have taken this opportunity
to protect the income from their savings.'
The bond, which pays an annual fixed rate of 7 per cent gross for five
years, went on sale on January 21 and has been bought by nearly 90,000
people aged at least 65.
Gross sales of National Savings products in February totalled Pounds 1.46bn.
Accrued interest was Pounds 158m and repayments amounted to Pounds 839m.
Premium Bonds, with sales of Pounds 201m, had their most successful month,
partly because those bought in February are eligible for the first Pounds 1m
prize draw in April. The total amount invested in National Savings at the
end of February was Pounds 47.7bn.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Call sign: India Romeo Alpha: Why London's main airport can
never be terrorist-proof
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the authorities at London's Heathrow Airport, together with the police
and the army, yesterday discussed ways of increasing security in the wake of
a second IRA mortar attack, there was acceptance that there were limits to
how much could be done to protect the public in such a large,
frequently-used and exposed area.
BAA, which owns Heathrow, said the police presence at the airport would be
stepped up. But it added: 'There is always going to be a balance between
allowing the airport to run and offering the highest possible security.'
Heathrow covers 2,958 acres. Its perimeter road is 9.5 miles long. More than
42m passengers pass through the airport every year and it has a workforce of
55,000 people. There are more than 20 hotels in the immediate vicinity, not
to mention Underground stations and many acres of car parks.
One civil aviation expert, speaking last night, said: 'To ensure 24-hour
protection against a mortar being mounted and fired somewhere within this
area within minutes is virtually impossible and impractical.'
In Northern Ireland, Belfast's City airport has managed to ensure a high
level of security, making it one of the few areas of the city relatively
well-protected from terrorist attack.
Tight security measures - involving permanent road blocks manned by armed
police backed by armed patrols - have been operational at the airport for
years. Its small size, however, makes such security measures more practical
than they would be at Heathrow - which is one of the busiest airports in the
world. Belfast's City airport, in comparison, handles only 842,000
passengers a year and employs just 250 staff.
Major John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert, said yesterday that areas at
Heathrow vulnerable to mortar attack could be identified using computer
calculations of potential trajectories. How-ever, he conceded that even this
system, used by some defence companies, was no guarantee against terrorist
attack.
Heathrow says that it has increased security substantially in recent years.
Spending on security is Pounds 54.4m a year, and involves a total of 1,400
staff.
In 1990 new legislation gave the transport secretary powers to detain
aircraft and close airports and freight operations if a serious security
lapse occurred.
In Spain, another European Union country facing a terrorist campaign, only
armed police have responsibility for security in airports. In Heathrow,
since BAA was privatised, security companies have been put in charge within
the airport, although armed police offer a back-up deterrent force.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (6): Prepare for the costs of
moving home - You may be able to afford the mortgage, but have you allowed
for all the additional bills of buying and selling? Gerald Cadogan makes a
list / Moving house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What does moving to a new home cost? Hassle and family stress for a start,
and a grim coming to terms with the detritus of one's past when sorting out
old belongings. And the costs can make a sizeable charge at the bottom of
the overall bill. The more you investigate beforehand, the better.
Selling
I asked the local offices of Lane Fox and Savills, two national estate
agents at the top end of the market, and Nationwide what they charge. All
are represented in the north Oxfordshire town of Banbury. Houses for sale on
their patch range from old village cottages and 19th century workmen's
terrace houses, through recent lower and middle income estates to old
rectories, manor houses and a few stately homes. In assessing fees, bear in
mind that they may be different at other branches or in London.
Lane Fox and Savills sit side by side in Banbury, but their prices differ. I
asked them the cost of selling two houses, one in the Pounds 450,000-Pounds
550,000 range, and the other a Pounds 60,000 property, which is roughly the
average house price in the Department of the Environment and Halifax
indices.
Lane Fox suggested around 2 per cent of the selling price plus the necessary
VAT as a fee for the large house. To market it effectively, this house would
need a colour brochure and national advertising, which we trust would mean
the Weekend FT as well as Country Life (where a half-page colour
advertisement would cost Pounds 1,500). The vendor pays these expenses
totalling around Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,500 (plus VAT). The fee for the
Pounds 60,000 house would be 2 per cent, to include a simpler brochure and
local advertising.
Savills suggested much the same: 2-2.5 per cent as an inclusive fee for the
cheaper house, and 2 per cent plus the expenses, which might amount to
Pounds 2,000-Pounds 4,000 (plus VAT), for the larger house.
Nationwide would ask for 2 per cent plus VAT for sole agency, as a set fee
to include local advertising and photography; no sale, no fee.
Account-holders with Nationwide might obtain a 10 per cent reduction, so
ask.
When selling:
Ask at least two agents who know your type of home to quote.
Do not necessarily choose the firm with the cheapest fee or which suggests
the highest asking price. It may have over-valued in order to gain your
instructions, in which case buyers will not come to view. A
reasonably-priced house can sell at close to the asking price, or above when
there is competition. Look hard at the firms which sell your type of home.
If you think fees are high, they are much higher on the Continent and in the
US.
Surveys
Still in Banbury, I asked chartered surveyor Paul Lester, of Lesters, what
he would charge for the two houses. He offers three types of survey. A
home-buyer's report suits a modern property and most buyers. It uses a Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors printed form which has a paragraph on
every aspect of the building as the basis of a thorough inspection. The
charge would be Pounds 175-Pounds 250 (plus VAT). An intermediate survey for
Pounds 300-Pounds 350 would look harder at the principal defects, such as
settlement, dry rot and damp.
A full structural survey could cost anything from Pounds 350 to Pounds
1,000, depending on the size of the property and the difficulty of access to
roof spaces and other hidden parts. Most surveys of this type are in the
Pounds 400-Pounds 450 range. Lester is surprised how many people do not take
surveys. If they do, 'they are not grateful when you have found something
wrong'. They do not want any threat to stop their new dream coming true.
But on a full survey it is rare that the buyer cannot save Pounds 1,000
(provided his offer is subject to contract and survey). Local surveyors with
local knowledge are vital.
Conveyancing
For the Pounds 60,000 house, Will Arber of solicitors Bower  Bailey, a firm
with branches in Oxfordshire and along the M4 corridor between Reading and
Bristol, suggested a likely bill of Pounds 250-Pounds 325 plus VAT to
include minor expenses such as copying and stamps.
The main fee depends on how much work is involved, which is unpredictable.
This figure is about the same as in 1980 - because of the competition among
solicitors to service the smaller number of property transactions in the
recession years. It does not include disbursements for local authority and
other searches, which have risen and vary from one authority to another -
but the authorities are now quicker at producing the information.
'It is the mortgage offer that holds things up. That is usually the last
piece of the jigsaw,' said Arber.
There is also the land registration fee, which rises in bands, and stamp
duty starting above Pounds 60,000 at 1 per cent of the total price (not of
the excess over Pounds 60,000).
For the Pounds 500,000 house stamp duty would be Pounds 5,000, and the land
registration fee Pounds 1,800. A likely solicitor's bill would be Pounds
750-Pounds 1500 plus VAT, Arber said, because it is usually more work and
there is an element of insurance in the bill. If something goes wrong, the
solicitor is liable for much more.
I then asked one of the solicitors in Bedford Row, London what he would
charge. He pointed out that the cheap house could make as much work as the
expensive one, and suggested as a rough guide half the agent's fee - thus
around 1 per cent plus VAT.
Both solicitors stressed how important it was to find a good lawyer who
checked everything. 'Unqualified people are doing more of the work now,'
said Amber, 'and they make mistakes.' That can lead to trouble in years
ahead. If you get a low estimate for the solicitor's bill, ask who in the
office will actually be doing the work. The local solicitors' advantage is
that they know the area and have the contacts.
Mortgages
The Weekend FT's Finance and the Family pages regularly report on mortgages
and the ever-changing menu of packages that building societies, banks and
other lenders offer. They want business and it is wise to shop around.
Nationwide for instance has no application fee at present and the basic
valuation is free. For fixed rates mortgages there is a reservation fee,
ranging from Pounds 95 for a two-year term to Pounds 300 for a 10-year term.
There is no further fee for variable rate mortgages.
All borrowers who take out their mortgages receive Pounds 250 'cashback'
about a month after completion - which virtually pays the maximum Pounds 300
fee.
Cheltenham and Gloucester has removed application and valuation fees for
home-buyers taking out a new mortgage or a further advance. The society
estimates that this saves about Pounds 160 for a Pounds 55,000 property and
Pounds 450 for Pounds 750,000 house. But there is still a reservation fee
for fixed rate mortgages.
Moving
On the day of moving comes a bill that is difficult to predict, as each
collection of household belongings is different. You can hire a van and do
it yourself with the help of friends, but if you call in the professionals,
they will want to see what furniture you have and where you live. Are you in
a third floor flat? How many antiques, pianos, grandfather clocks and
chandeliers do you have? How much will you pack yourself? For journeys of
less than 100 miles, labour is a large part of the cost.
Banbury Removals suggested a possible range of Pounds 250-Pounds 350 plus
VAT for moving the contents of a three-bedroom semi 80 miles (and perhaps
Pounds 155-Pounds 200 for 10-15 miles). An old rectory might come to Pounds
800-Pounds 900. Bishop's Move suggested Pounds 250-Pounds 450 for the
smaller house (and Pounds 200-Pounds 400 for 10-15 miles), and Pounds 400-
Pounds 800 for the larger. These estimates can only be rough.
Ask for several quotations, and light a candle for a sunny day.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Detained asylum seekers protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 180 asylum seekers started an indefinite hunger-strike yesterday
at Campsfield detention centre, near Oxford, in protest at their detention
without trial or charge for periods of up to a year.
The centre, run by the Group 4 security company, opened in November to take
the overflow of detainees from Harmondsworth, near Heathrow Airport.
The centre has drawn protests from more than 100 Oxford dons, including 24
professors and 11 heads of colleges, who signed an open letter to Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
A hunger-strike by a group of Algerian detainees ended last weekend when
they were taken to a private psychiatric hospital in York and then released.
This time, all but a handful of the centre's 200 inmates have joined the
strike.
Mr Charles Wardle, immigration minister, said in a radio interview last week
that 'only a tiny proportion' of those seeking asylum were detained 'if they
don't comply with restrictions'.
Two detainees interviewed at Campsfield yesterday said they had been
detained on arrival in the country and had not been offered an option of
complying with restrictions.

A sharp fall in exports to the European Union led to the surprise widening
of the UK trade gap in December, official figures issued yesterday show.
The visible, or merchandise, deficit widened to Pounds 1.57bn compared with
November's Pounds 1.28bn. This is the largest monthly deficit for almost
four years - except for December 1992. The November figure turned out to be
worse than provisionally estimated, revised up from a provisional Pounds
1bn.
Most of the deterioration occurred in Europe, where the UK does more than
half its trading. The seasonally adjusted figures from the Central
Statistical Office showed that in December the visible trade deficit with
the EU was Pounds 903m, compared with Pounds 543m in November.
Some decline in exports to continental Europe was to be expected, given the
weakness of the area's economies, but most analysts were surprised by the
3.6 per cent fall in volume terms, compared with November. The trade
position with countries outside the EU improved.
The latest figures again raised doubts about the new system for gathering
trade statistics. The CSO is carrying out an inquiry into the system -
Intrastat - following fears that it underestimates imports.
Uncertainty about the figures was not enough to assuage fears that trends
point to a marked widening of the UK trade gap.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'Export and
import trends are now adverse.' He added that in the last quarter of last
year export volumes excluding oil and erratic items - ships, aircraft,
precious stones and silver - fell 3 per cent, while import volumes rose 3.5
per cent.
Mr Briscoe added: 'This is good news for the recovery, but the inability to
satisfy the demand domestically is a real worry.'
The overall underlying deficit - excluding oil and erratics - deteriorated
to Pounds 1.8bn in December from Pounds 1.6bn in November.
The figures suggest that manufacturers are continuing to protect their
export margins. In the fourth quarter they raised export prices 2 per cent
compared with the previous quarter, in spite of a 3 per cent fall in volumes
in the same period. They raised their prices 11 per cent compared with the
same quarter a year ago, when volumes fell 2.5 per cent.
Trade with France fared particularly badly in the fourth quarter of last
year. The deficit was Pounds 775m compared with Pounds 155m in the third
quarter. The deficit with Germany was about unchanged at about Pounds 1bn.

Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland promised yesterday that
it would provide funding for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent
and Independent on Sunday, if a takeover bid by a consortium which includes
Mirror Group Newspapers was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The move - with the group saying that it would provide finance in line with
its 29.9 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing - is designed to remove any
possible danger of insolvency at the newspaper.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Labour attacks watchdog changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, has seized on the views of
some Tory backbenchers to intensify pressure on the government over
regulation in the financial services sector. A Commons committee is already
examining the issue.
Seven Conservative MPs have tabled a Commons motion which suggests that the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog for retail financial
services, will lower regulatory standards.
In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Darling says the
government cannot 'continue to ignore the mounting concern and scepticism
that surrounds the present system of regulation'.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Capital issues reach record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies announced new capital-raising issues worth Pounds 6.86bn in
February, the highest monthly total since records began in 1986, Philip
Coggan writes.
The figures, published by the Bank of England yesterday, show that companies
are still taking advantage of what, in historic terms, are low bond yields
and high share prices.
Of the total, Pounds 4.92bn was in sterling and of this Pounds 2.1bn was in
the form of ordinary shares.
Actual gross issues in February totalled Pounds 4.84bn. After redemptions of
Pounds 2.01bn, the net figure was Pounds 2.83bn.
New issues have been high since the start of 1993, and the evidence is that
companies are replacing bank loans, accumulated during the recession, with
bond and share issues.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Maxwell administrators agree to pensions talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the firm acting as administrators to Maxwell Communication
Corporation, has agreed to hold negotiations with lawyers acting for the
Maxwell pensioners.
The pensioners are seeking the return of up to Pounds 235m allegedly
misappropriated from their company pension schemes.
The move follows a closed High Court judgment on February 25 when Mr Justice
Vinelott strengthened an earlier decision not to authorise a distribution of
MCC assets to creditors until pensioners' claims had been protected.
Any settlement arising from the talks would significantly affect the
proposed distribution of assets - currently exceeding Pounds 680m - raised
by the sale of MCC businesses by the administrators.
The four high street clearing banks would be among those unsecured creditors
of MCC that would receive considerably reduced dividend payments from the
administrators if the talks succeed.
The negotiations will be aimed at short-circuiting the complex legal
proceedings now before the Appeal Court in which the liquidators of
Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former managers of the Maxwell
company pension schemes, are seeking a proprietary claim to the first Pounds
235m of the Pounds 680m raised by the administrators.
In December Mr Justice Vinelott said: 'It would, I think, shock the
conscience of any informed member of the public if it were to transpire that
monies which could have been claimed as belonging to pension funds had been
distributed to unsecured creditors, however tenuous the claim by BIM and the
pension trustees might have appeared to be at the time of the distribution.'
If successful, the BIM court action would substantially reduce the money
available to meet the claims of other unsecured creditors, currently
totalling over Pounds 2bn.
It was Mr Justice Vinelott's rejection of BIM's arguments which prompted it
to take the issue to the Court of Appeal earlier this week. Three appeal
court judges have reserved their judgment.
However, with a final appeal to the House of Lords possible, authorisation
of the distribution of the MCC assets is likely to be delayed until May at
the earliest. It is this delay which is believed to have brought the MCC
administrators to the negotiating table with lawyers acting for the
pensioners.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Customs defends handling of Matrix case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs  Excise prosecutors continued with the Matrix Churchill trial
although they knew of the government's confidential shift of policy to
promote the export to Iraq of machinery capable of making arms, the Scott
inquiry was told yesterday.
The prosecution of three businessmen was brought on the basis that the tools
produced by the company were specially designed for military use and that
Whitehall officials were unaware of this, Mr Cedric Andrew, an assistant
chief Customs investigator, told Lord Justice Scott.
In a statement defending the Customs' decision to prosecute, Mr Andrew said
that Department of Trade and Industry officials suspected some machine tools
exported to Iraq might be used for military purposes.
This did not, however, amount to an adequate defence for the three
businessmen accused, but later acquitted, of evading export restrictions.
Mr Andrew said it was clear from the early stages of the investigation that
the government's policy on exports to Iraq was not 'black and white'. There
was 'quite an evident will' in some Whitehall circles after the Iran/Iraq
ceasefire to modify the policy.
He added: 'The investigation and prosecution conceded that there was plenty
of government suspicion, perhaps bordering upon knowledge, that some, if not
many, machine tools were going to Iraq for military use.'
Since this was conceded by Customs, it was not felt to be an area worth
'prolonged investigation'. Had the alleged breached of export regulations
occurred in relation to 'dual-use' machinery no prosecutions would therefore
have taken place, said Mr Andrew.
Instead, the Customs prosecution focused on the premise that the Matrix
Churchill exports were designed specially for military use, Mr Andrew said.
'Had the exporters openly declared, when their sales contracts revealed it,
that their machine tools were clearly intended for military use, then the
evidence is, from all those involved in the licensing decision, that an
export licence would have been refused,' he added. 'Such a declaration . . .
would have removed any argument or uncertainty about military end-use.'
Mr Andrew said that nobody in government, including Mr Alan Clark, the
former trade minister, had ever argued that, had the full facts been known,
the exporting of specially designed military-use goods would have been
approved.
There was no evidence, however, that anyone in the DTI knew the Matrix
Churchill machinery was certain to be used, for military purposes.
Mr Andrew said: 'Customs evidence contends that the defendants had not told
the government the truth that the goods for which an export licence was
sought were specially designed.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Leaving white cliffs for golden sands: The travel trade
needs fewer Britons holidaying abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ms Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist Authority, climbed into
a London taxi recently, she berated the driver because his cab was blue.
'Black taxis, red buses - these are icons,' Ms Biss says. 'Changing them is
like changing the colour of the white cliffs of Dover.'
By promoting red London buses and black cabs abroad, the BTA helped UK
tourism to a record year in 1993. The number of overseas visitors was up 4
per cent to 19.3m. Spending by foreign visitors rose 15 per cent to Pounds
9.1bn. This year visits to Britain by people from overseas are expected to
exceed 20m for the first time.
Unfortunately for the balance of payments, companies which take UK
holidaymakers abroad had an even better 1993. The number of foreign holidays
taken by UK residents rose 8 per cent to 23.5m. The proportion of British
holidaymakers who took holidays of four nights or more in the UK fell to its
lowest level ever - 58 per cent, compared with 70 per cent in 1983.
The travel account deficit of the balance of payments - which includes
business and educational trips as well as holidays - increased to Pounds
3.7bn last year from Pounds 3.4bn in 1992. With the package-tour industry
forecasting that overseas holidays this summer could be as much as 20 per
cent higher than last year, the deficit is likely to increase further.
Little of the blame can be laid at the door of those who bring visitors to
the UK. For a country without reliable sunshine or a substantial ski
industry, the UK has achieved considerable success.
In 1992 the UK was the world's fifth biggest earner of international tourist
revenues after the US, France, Spain, and Italy. In the same year overseas
visitor earnings accounted for 7.3 per cent of the UK's invisible exports
and 3.7 per cent of all exports. If fares paid to UK airlines are included,
the figures rise to 9.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent.
Visitors to the UK are sufficiently impressed to come back. In 1992, 71 per
cent of visitors had been to the UK before. Visitors said heritage,
countryside, arts and entertainment were the main attractions.
Ms Biss says the key to boosting the tourist industry is persuading more UK
residents to take their holidays at home. The industry, she says, cannot
survive on growth from foreign visitors alone.
The difficulty for UK tourism is that it is more fragmented than the
overseas package holiday industry. Three large companies dominate the
overseas holiday business: Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad. Each has its
own charter airline. Thomson and Airtours own the UK's two biggest travel
agency chains.
By contrast, a report last year by Coopers and Lybrand, the management
consultants, estimated that the domestic tourist market was made up of
220,000 businesses represented by more than 30 trade organisations. The
largest organisation responsible for domestic tourist marketing is the
English Tourist Board, whose government grant is set to fall from Pounds
13.9m in 1993-94 to Pounds 10m by 1995-96.
Ms Rosemary Astles, Thomson's marketing director, says her company's annual
marketing budget is 'significantly more' than the board's grant.
While foreign visitors come to the UK for history and culture, Britons go
abroad for the sunshine their own country cannot provide. A survey last year
by Lunn Poly found that only 8 per cent of package travellers had any
curiosity about the culture of the countries they planned to visit.
Ms Biss believes more could be done to market UK holidays to the British.
She says she is talking to the travel agency chains about giving greater
priority to domestic holidays.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Abta wins holiday insurance test case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A schoolgirl and her teacher yesterday lost a High Court test action against
the Association of British Travel Agents over a holiday insurance premium
that was not repaid when an Abta member became insolvent.
The value of the claim, on behalf of 54 other pupils at Nower Hill School,
Pinner, north London, was just Pounds 10, but a further 25,000 cases rested
on the outcome.
The teacher had booked the holiday with Abta member Adventure Express Travel
Services. The company became insolvent before the party was due to leave,
and Abta refunded the money already paid except for the insurance.
The teacher claimed that the deduction by Abta, which denied liability, was
a breach of what it had promoted as 'the Abta promise' and that the
association was therefore in breach of contract.
Mr Justice Mitchell ruled that the Abta notice, which explains to customers
the form of protection Abta extends to them, did not contain words of
contractual promise and therefore no contract existed between the teacher
and Abta.

FT  12 MAR 94 / TGWU launches probe over funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's second largest union yesterday launched an investigation into
alleged misuse of union funds by officials on Merseyside and Manchester.
The investigation is at present internal but it is understood that Mr Bill
Morris, TGWU general secretary, will call in the police if necessary.
Three officials from the north-west region of the TGWU general union are to
be questioned by Mr Albert Blyghton, the union's legal secretary, over a
number of issues including alleged intimidation of members during recent
elections for the union's general council. It is understood that the
allegations are not against the elected council members.
Nobody has been suspended and Mr Bob Owens, the regional secretary, is not
under investigation. Mr Morris said: 'The leadership . . . is acting to
defend the integrity of the union.'
Among the allegations is that a grant of Pounds 53,000 from the European
Union, given for training shop stewards, was transferred into a non-union
account and has gone missing.
The union had also been paying money to members involved in a dispute at a
cleaning company on Merseyside but has been unable to check details of how
many members are involved.
The investigation will also look at payments to TGWU members involved in a
three-year dispute at a Merseyside company. More than Pounds 300,000 in
strike pay has already been paid without a firm record of how many were
involved in the strike.
Another allegation is that an advertising company paid the union to carry
advertisements on taxis driven by TGWU members, but the contract was never
fulfilled.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (5): Cautious buyers are
hungry for more choice - What's on offer for eager homehunters / The state
of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN

<TEXT>
The recovery in the housing market is as variable as in the rest of the
economy. Prime London prices - and rents - are up, and that is spilling over
into the home counties. The number of repossessions is coming down and
negative equity is disappearing. Agents have plenty of potential buyers on
their books but not enough houses to sell to them. When buyers compete, a
property sells for more than its guide price.
Buyers are still being circumspect. If a property price is set too high,
they will not even bother to look. Prices are still being cut on houses
which are in danger of becoming 'old chestnuts', or are so already.
Stockton House, in Wiltshire, is down from Pounds 1m to Pounds 700,000, and
Kingsmead House near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds
950,000 (both with Savills). The old rectory at Chudleigh near Exeter,
Devon, priced at Pounds 285,000 in 1991, is on offer through Constables at
Pounds 199,950, but offers of Pounds 175,000 will be considered.
Set a sensible guide price for a good property, and people flock to view.
Even the houses that have stuck are moving, which is a good omen, as it
underpins the market for fresh properties.
The potential buyers are 'mainly people with a pent-up desire to move,' says
James Laing, of agents Strutt  Parker. They are tired of living in
short-term, rented accommodation or waiting for their present house to lift
in value. However, in Guildford, Surrey, Tommy de Mallet Morgan, of Savills,
meets young City workers, with bonus, girlfriend and Porsche, who have the
cash for a six-bedroom house in the Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1m range. 'It
is an equity-driven market. They want the best and have a sharp instinct for
what is new on the market, perhaps because their work is trading.'
Vendors have been reluctant because they want to secure their new place
first, or are waiting for price rises to bring their properties back to the
amount they paid a few years ago. But there are signs of more instructions,
notably in the north, north-west and Yorkshire.
Houses are selling quickly and only genuine cash buyers have a chance of
getting what they want. Buyers who agree terms have also stopped reneging on
completing their deals, notes Tim Blenkin, of Blenkin  Co, Knight Frank 
Rutley's associate in York.
With so little to buy, purchasers will consider a long-term let. Strutt 
Parker's office in Newbury, Berkshire, reported a huge response when it
brought to market Buscot Manor - a National Trust property dating from 1691
near Faringdon in Oxfordshire - for rental on an assured shorthold tenancy
of an initial 10 years.
The terms were not cheap. The rent was to be around Pounds 1,300 a month,
and the tenant had to agree to spend at least Pounds 15,000 on the house in
the first six months of tenancy, to include refurbishing the kitchen. A
shortlist evolved of five prospective tenants who were happy with the terms;
that has been reduced to two between whom the trust is deciding.
James Laing expects a rise in prices in 1994, but not of the 20 per cent or
so predicted in December by Yolande Barnes, of Savills Residential Research.
Buyers remain cautious even though conditions for buying have not been so
good for many years, in terms of house prices, household incomes and low
interest rates, with the chance of locking into them through long-term fixed
rate mortgages.
It is hard to predict the impact of the April tax increases or of the
government's endless woes. And as more sellers gain the confidence to
instruct agents, the supply-demand imbalance will lessen and the pace of
price rises slow down.
London has led the recovery, thanks first to the overseas buyers who have
been at work since autumn 1992, and to the recipients of City bonuses.
Hamptons prime residential property index shows a 9.9 per cent rise in 1993,
the first increase in capital values for four years, and Cluttons London
Residential sees the average discount between asking price and selling price
now narrowed to 2.5 per cent.
Prices in central London have continued moving up by 6 to 7 per cent so far
this year, but they may drop back 2 to 3 per cent when more stock becomes
available. Winkworth reports properties coming under offer at the asking
price within a day. Foreign buyers are still very much in the market.
Outside London the rise has been strongest in areas such as Surrey, which
were first to fall in the slump. The London euphoria is starting to ripple
through the home counties - at least at the top end, where Ian Stewart, of
Savills, has sold six properties in the Pounds 1m-Pounds 3m range recently.
These include West Croft Park at Chobham in Surrey, and Harewood Park at
Ascot, which both went for near their asking prices of Pounds 3m and Pounds
2m respectively.
On the next rung down, the optimism has yet to become euphoria, but de
Mallet Morgan has underbidders regretting they did not offer more. Why?
Because they cannot find anything else. 'A good, free-standing five-bedroom
house, I could sell just like that.' Eventually, the rises will spread to
all parts of the country, he says.
With instructions starting to warm up, the building societies are the chief
problem, says Blenkin. Scarred by their losses on houses they repossessed,
they are now extra cautious about lending on older properties, which is
nerve-wracking for buyers and sellers.
In Norfolk, Bidwells' old chestnuts are starting to go after 'hanging
around' for 1 1/2 to two years. But Norfolk is not for commuters. Nor is
Shropshire, where too few properties are for sale, says Eddie Jenkins, of
John German, in Shrewsbury. The market has perked up since the end of the
year, but there is no surge. Bank managers are telling potential sellers,
'hold firm', he says.
In the west country, the number of buyers moving from the home counties fell
off after 1989, but they are now starting to return. Stags finds that
two-thirds of its buyers are from south of a line from the Cotswolds to the
Wash. More buyers now look for a home with some income, such as cash from
holiday rentals. The company sold Ellicombe Manor in Somerset, for more than
Pounds 300,000, with four letting units in gardens of two acres.
Agents across the country would agree. For Jackson-Stops and Staff, 1993 saw
a 20 to 30 per cent increase in deals but little price movement, says Andrew
Froude, chairman. This year he expects more of the same - more activity but
no dramatic price increases. 'They may average 5 per cent over the year,' he
says. More optimistic forecasts may be counterproductive. Vendors hanging on
may lead to price increases but, while buyers are re-establishing their
confidence, they will be cautious.
No-one wants a return to the 1980s, least of all farmers, who saw their
earnings increase 60 per cent last year, thanks to better EU payments from
the devaluation of the pound, and lower interest on their overdrafts. Laing
believes that farms look a good market for the next five or six years,
covering 1996, when the present Common Agricultural Policy has to be renewed
in line with Gatt.
Now that insurance companies and other institutions have been disinvesting,
it is increasingly a market governed by farmers - which is healthy. As for
big estates, Froude says: 'They always sell at a premium and always find a
buyer, because very few come up in a year. They are nice for journalists to
write about, but they are a special case.'
The last word goes to Ian Stewart. 'It is the healthiest market for quite
some time.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Councils lose challenge to reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge yesterday rejected applications by three councils for a
judicial review of the Local Government Commission's proposals for council
reorganisation in north-east England.
Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils and Ryedale District Council
are all opposing the commission's recommendations for five unitary
authorities north of the Humber in place of the current two-tier system.
They had argued to the High Court that the commission had failed to consult
properly or to consider the possibility of maintaining the status quo.
Mr Justice Laws rejected their applications, ruling that the commission had
acted properly. He said the applications by the three authorities were an
attempt to raise a challenge on points of law about the commission's
recommendations when in fact their complaint was about the merits of its
recommendations.
'It is elementary that complaints of this kind are not generally the
business of the judicial review court,' he said.
It was more appropriate for representations to be made to Mr John Gummer,
the environment secretary, than to the courts, he suggested.
The judge's ruling does not clear the way for the government to reach an
immediate decision on the commission's recommendations. The authorities
intend to apply to the Court of Appeal for a hearing to mount another
challenge. No decision could be made until after any such hearing.

FT  12 MAR 94 / In 40 years' time, black Africa might reach the level of
wealth it had 20 years ago: IMF reforms are paying off, but the continent is
way behind the rest of the world, says the World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Unless sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40
years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s,
warns a World Bank report on the region published tomorrow.
Even Ghana, rated the best of Africa's reforming countries which has
achieved real growth of about 5 per cent a year, is still among the world's
poorest countries: 'At this growth rate, the average Ghanaian will not cross
the poverty line for another 50 years,' says the report.
The report is the most sombre in a series that go back to the early stages
of Africa's economic crisis. Past studies have combined tough appraisals
with upbeat expectations of reform. The latest study warns that success will
not come easy, but cautions against 'undue pessimism', pointing to the fact
that Asian countries which had almost no growth between 1930 and 1960 now
enjoy 'stunning' growth.
Structural adjustment is essential but not sufficient if sub-Saharan Africa
is to achieve sustained growth, says the World Bank in a 280-page appraisal
of economic reform. But while it stresses the need for 'good governance' in
Africa, the report does not elaborate on either the measures required, or
assess its impact on economic performance in the years under review.
Of the 29 countries studied in the report, the six with the most improvement
in macroeconomic policies between 1981-86 and 1987-91 enjoyed the strongest
resurgence in economic performance, with an average annual growth of 2 per
cent in GDP.
By contrast, says the report, countries that did not improve their policies
saw their GDP decline by 2 per cent a year, in all likelihood increasing the
number of poor.
Although the outcomes are 'encouraging' they are not as positive as they
might be. Current growth rates among the best African performers are still
too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades.
'So far the rebounds have merely bought countries back to their historical
trend of low growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto
a higher growth path.
'Without further substantial increases in agricultural, investment, export
and GDP growth, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to lag behind other
developing nations.'
The report examines the relationship between economic policy and growth in
sub Saharan Africa, by comparing the performances of 29 countries during two
periods: 1981-86, when the region was in economic crisis but few countries
were implementing economic reforms, and in 1987-91 when most African
governments had adopted World Bank supported structural adjustment
programmes.
The six leading reformers reduced budget deficits, curbed inflation,
introduced competitive exchange rates, tariff reforms and agricultural
incentives.
Countries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture
have seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops,
says the Bank.
The study 'also shows that it is not always true that devaluation
necessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were
complementing policies of wage, fiscal and monetary restraint . . . and
indeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market.'
Export volumes increased significantly, despite declining terms of trade, if
the exchange rate, agricultural pricing and marketing liberalisation polies
were implemented, says the report.
Comparing Africa and other developing regions, the Bank says: 'It is
worrisome that even the best performers in Africa do not come close to
matching the good macroeconomic policies typified by Chile, Malaysia, Mexico
and Thailand, where inflation is close to 10 per cent a year, budget
balances range from deficits of 2 per cent of GDP to small surpluses and
currencies are fully convertible, at least for current account
transactions.'
African governments are criticised for slow progress in privatisation. 'The
value of privatisations in Nigeria between 1988 and 1992,' says the Bank,
'was less than 1 per cent of that in Argentina, Malaysia or Mexico, even
after adjusting for Nigeria's smaller GDP.'
Africa's financial sector is still 'heavily burdened' by public sector
demands for credits, says the Bank. Central governments alone (excluding
public enterprises) absorb more than 30 per cent of domestic credit.
'There is substantially more room for improving policies,' said Mr Kim
Jaycox, the Bank vice president for Africa, at a press conference in
Washington to launch the study.
'Macroeconomic policies deteriorated in a third of the countries, and no
country has achieved a first rate macroeconomic policy stance - low
inflation, very low budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate,' he
said.
Africa performs particularly poorly in comparison with other developing
countries.
In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is
three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than
Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
The report notes Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of
food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to
8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. The high rate of
population growth - more than 3 per cent a year - strains the limited
resources available.
Adjustment programmes can establish a framework for sound investment and
efficient resource use, but are no substitute for long-term development
efforts to build the capabilities of Africa's people by putting adequate
resources into education and strengthening weak management capacity.
'Emphasis on universal primary education is the key to achieving rapid
growth in the best performing Asian economies,' says the bank.
Other central policy measures which are vital include the need to accelerate
divestiture programmes and develop financial sectors. Reducing Africa's
external debt burden and maintaining aid flows 'is essential', says the Bank
'but debt relief and aid only make sense if sound economic reform programmes
are in place.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE VIEW FROM THE WORLD BANK OVER 14 YEARS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994
Current growth rates among the best African performers are still too low
to reduce poverty much in the next two decades. So far, the rebounds
have merely brought countries back to their historical trend of low
growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto a
higher-growth path. Without further substantial increases in
agricultural, investment, export and GDP growth, Sub-Saharan Africa will
continue to lag behind other developing regions.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arafat wants peace talks, says Kozyrev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said in Tunis last night after
a meeting with Mr Yassir Arafat that the PLO leader had expressed his
commitment to resuming peace talks with Israel.
Earlier in the day he had arrived in Israel for talks with the prime
minister and foreign minister
at the beginning of what Russian officials described as an independent and
'dramatic' shuttle mission between Israel and PLO headquarters Tunis.
At the same time, President Boris Yeltsin named Mr Viktor Posuvalyuk, head
of the foreign ministry's Middle East department, as his special envoy on
the Middle East crisis. Presidential envoys enjoy wide authority and close
ties with the president.
Mr Kozyrev said in Tel Aviv, Russia wanted to save the peace process and was
supporting PLO demands for an international presence in the occupied
territories and further measures by Israel to protect Palestinian lives in
the wake of the Hebron massacre two weeks ago. Mr Kozyrev made no comment on
Moscow's announced support for the reconvening of a multilateral Middle East
peace conference in Madrid.
The Russian initiative marks Moscow's decision to pursue an independent
Middle East policy for the first time since the Madrid peace conference in
1991 and has been less than welcomed by Israel.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has let it be known that Russian
intervention is not welcome because it exposes the division in policy
between Russia and the US, the two co-sponsors, which in turn strengthens
the PLO's push for more Israeli concessions. Mr Rabin also rejected any
attempt to reconvene a Middle East peace conference in Madrid.
Meanwhile, Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, appeared to be
increasing pressure on both sides to return to talks. Israeli officials said
Washington was now supporting the PLO demand for the evacuation from Hebron
of 415 Jewish settlers living in the heart of the Israeli occupied West Bank
town of 110,000 Arabs. Mr Rabin has so far ruled out evacuating the settlers
on political grounds. The settlers have vowed a nation-wide campaign of
civil disobedience to resist any effort to force them to leave.
Mr Christopher also sent a secret message to Mr Arafat yesterday. The US has
threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning
the Hebron murders unless Mr Arafat sets a date for returning to talks with
Israel. A vote on the UN resolution, a key PLO demand before returning to
negotiations, has been delayed until tomorrow at the request of the US. PLO
officials said the US is using its delaying powers and the threat of a veto
to put pressure on Palestinians. The US is also apparently backing Israel
which is unhappy about the inclusion of the word Jerusalem as part of the
Israeli-occupied territories in the language of the resolution.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's underlying inflation, which excludes the more volatile price
movements of fresh foods and energy, fell by 0.2 per cent in February to
give a year-on year rise of 4.9 per cent, the lowest rate since April 1988.
Higher fresh food prices kept headline inflation unchanged to give a
year-on-year rate of 5 per cent. The underlying rate was helped by a fall
from 6.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent in the traditionally high-inflation
services component of the index. The extent of this fall indicated more
moderate unit labour costs as well as slack domestic demand. Analysts
believe inflation will fall rapidly in the coming months. Madrid securities
firm FG forecasts a headline annual rate of 4.3 per cent by June and 3.8 per
cent by the end of the year.
Germany's M3 money supply grew by a revised annual rate of 21.2 per cent in
January. The Bundesbank's target growth range for M3 in 1994 is 4-6 per
cent.

China's budget deficit is forecast to reach Yuan67bn(Pounds 5.2bn) this
year, an increase over last year's actual deficit using new accounting
procedures. Mr Liu Zhongli, China's finance minister, presented a bleak
picture of China's finances to the National People's Congress, warning that
difficulties in implementing a new tax system and widespread tax evasion
made it virtually impossible to predict revenues. China's 1994 state budget
anticipates revenues of Yuan476bn and expenditures of Yuan543bn. This year's
deficit will be funded largely by issuing Yuan115bn of domestic bonds. Mr
Liu indicated that this year's deficit would be about 15 per cent higher
than last year's.

Carmen Lawrence (left), former premier of Western Australia, is set to

on Ms Lawrence's behalf, Senator Graham Richardson, one of the most
influential figures in the Labor Party, said he believed Ms Lawrence 'will
win (a cabinet position) and she will win very comfortably'. He declined to
say which jobs she might be offered. Despite the Labor Party's lack of
popularity in Western Australia, Ms Lawrence is a well-liked local figure
and is not expected to have any difficulty holding the Fremantle seat. Ms
Lawrence's sensible style and popular appeal have caused speculation that
she could be a future Labor prime minister.

<TEXT>
War-torn Cambodia was pledged more than Dollars 700m in additional aid
yesterday after an appeal by King Norodom Sihanouk for a 'Marshall Plan'
style programme to help the country back to prosperity. The offers included
Dollars 15m to help clear some of the 10m mines scattered across the country
which kill or maim about 300 people a month. The money was pledged at a
two-day conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia. The delegates, from 32
countries, the EU and 12 international organisations, noted progress in
market reforms, trade liberalisation, improved tax revenues, reduced

A judge has indicted Mr Francisco Macri, billionaire owner of Argentina's
Fiat and Peugeot cars manufacturer, Sevel, on charges of evading Dollars 55m
of tax. The indictment has shocked the local business community and the
Buenos Aires stock exchange. Sevel shares fell 6.7 per cent and traders
predicted the fall-out could hit other companies of Mr Macri's Socma group,
which includes construction, insurance, telecommunications, TV and farming.

Mr Richard Leakey, Kenya's foremost conservationist, was yesterday back in
charge of the Kenya Wildlife Service after international pressure for his
reinstatement prevailed over a vilification campaign conducted by
politicians of the ruling Kanu party. President Daniel arap Moi said he
would not accept Mr Leakey's resignation, submitted in January, following
accusations of racism, arrogance and corruption by Mr William ole Ntimama,
the powerful minister for local government. Diplomats, donors and tour
operators warned President Moi that Mr Leakey's departure would do
incalculable damage to Kenya's reputation as a world leader in wildlife
conservation, which underpins a Dollars 450m-a-year tourist industry. Mr
Leakey is said to have placed some tough conditions for his return,
including the removal of his fiercest political opponents.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retail sales rose sharply last month but a large downward revision to
figures for January indicated the rate of growth of consumer spending has
probably moderated since the end of last year. The Commerce Department said
sales rose 1.5 per cent last month and by 7.5 per cent in the year to
February. But officials also revised down estimates for January to show a
decline in sales of 1.6 per cent from December rather than the fall of 0.5
per cent initially reported. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.
'The weather is playing havoc with first quarter data,' said Mr Joseph Liro,
chief economist at S G Warburg in New York. He said flat sales in January
and February taken together reflected the very cold weather and the impact
of the earthquake in southern California. A large increase in sales was
likely this month, he said.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (3): Where German efficiency
falls down - Lack of information can turn buying a home into a complicated
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German residential property market is neither transparent nor efficient,
says Oscar Kienzle, head of Knight Frank  Rutley's German operations.
He explains: 'Go to Knight Frank in London and they will tell you exactly
how much you have to pay to buy a flat in Knightsbridge. The market there is
efficient in that, if you are prepared to pay more than the odds, you will
definitely get what you want.
'From the seller's point of view, the converse holds true - drop your price
from the market level and you'll find a buyer.'
But that, says Kienzle, is not the case in Germany where information on what
is for sale and for how much is hard to come by. There are no 'for sale'
signs and national chains of estate agents are few.
As you might expect in Germany's strongly regionalised economy, the market
is local in character. Knowledge gleaned in Munich will not be of much help
if you are posted to Frankfurt or Dusseldorf.
Even within the regions, the market is fragmented. In the Frankfurt area,
for example, few agents will be able to give you an overview of prices for
the whole city and its satellite towns.
The market in the Frankfurt region is controlled by at least 1,000 Maklers
(brokers), most of whom specialise in a small area. The expert on the market
for flats in the expensive west end of the city centre is unlikely to know
much about villas for sale in nearby dormitory towns such as Bad Homburg,
Bad Vilbel or Kronberg.
Assuming fluency in German, and a degree of familiarity with local tax law,
you should reckon on at least a year between arriving in Germany and buying
a house, says one banker who has just bought a property on the outskirts of
Frankfurt.
'The most important thing you must bring with you when you're considering
buying a house is time,' agrees Kienzle.
The inefficiency of the market means there are bargains to be had
occasionally - but you have to be there long enough to spot them when they
become available.
It follows that international executives who might be posted to Frankfurt
would be well advised to rent a flat or a house on arrival and buy only if
they are likely to be staying for five years or more.
The chance of making a substantial capital gain in less than five years is
small, says Dr Walter Fuhrberg, managing director of Blumenauer Immobilien,
one of the larger property agencies in Frankurt.
House prices in the Frankfurt area have risen at 4 to 5 per cent a year
since the late 1980s - not enough to justify a speculative purchase,
especially in view of the costs and complications of buying. This a far cry
from the giddy price movements in the UK residential property market.
But the stable price development reflects Germans' deep-rooted fear of
inflation as well as a reluctance to treat home-buying as a form of
financial speculation. 'Germans do not regard houses and flats as a
commodity, as something to be bought and sold,' says a broker in the
Stuttgart area.
'Buying a house is very serious and very formal. For most people, it is an
enormous step signifying that you've made it and you are settling down for
life.'
Indeed, in Germany as a whole, only around 40 per cent of the population
owns a house, compared with a Europe-wide average of 60 per cent.
If you are very rich, there are tax advantages associated with owning
residential property and renting it out.
There are also tax benefits if you build your own property - very popular in
a country where, unlike Britain, there is little sentiment attached to
living in an old house.
Another incentive to buy comes from the low cost of money: interest rates
for home loans have fallen far more steeply that short-term rates in the
past 18 months.
In the Frankfurt area, prices range from DM500,000 (Pounds 200,000) for a
small flat in a good area to DM5m or more for a villa in the Taunus hills
outside the town. Rents range from DM15-DM25 per square metre, often with a
service charge and bills on top.
It could be that the cost of financing a mortgage is now below the rental
costs of living in a similar property. Against this, you must weigh the fee
of 5 per cent of the value of the house (plus value added tax) which you pay
on purchase and maintenance costs. There are also the non-financial
considerations - such as the sheer complexity of finding and buying the
house in which you would like to live.
Renting remains the most straightforward option for all but the most
long-term expatriates. At the top end of the market, there is no shortage of
properties, and rents have fallen over the past couple of years.
Renting is not without its complexities and frustrations, however.
There is nothing more irritating than paying a fee to the Makler, who often
seems to have done nothing other than put an advertisement in the paper and
wait to be overwhelmed by calls from expatriates. The fee is two months'
rent, plus VAT, fixed by law.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (4): Why Austria stays tough
 -The difficulties facing foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not impossible to buy property in Austria if you are a foreigner, just
difficult. And it helps to have an experienced adviser.
Often, people are told that foreigners cannot buy homes there, but a
spokesman at Austria's embassy in London says: 'That is totally wrong. We
let foreign people buy. It depends on the area.'
Yet, a wide variety of reasons continues to be given for not letting people
buy. Among them: Austria is a small country (32,378 sq miles); wealthy
foreigners building holiday homes in the best scenic areas have kept out
local people and put up prices; and there would be ghost villages populated
for only part of the year.
Another embassy staffer had a further explanation for Austria's resistance:
that, with only 13.5 per cent of the country suitable for settlement, there
was a projected increase of 18 per cent in the population of 7.6m by 2011.
He conceded, however, that if his country joined the European Union, some
changes would have to be made.
Indeed, the requirement for citizens of other EU countries to be allowed to
buy in Austria has been one of the main sticking points in negotiations for
its entry. A referendum on joining will probably be held in June.
Some people have assumed that Austria might, like Denmark, get an opt-out
arrangement on property acquisition. But the EU is becoming impatient with
members making such requests. In effect, it is telling applicants for
membership: 'If you want to join, you know the rules.'
With some of Austria's neighbours having serious problems, you might think
people would not want to buy a holiday home there. But they do. Travel agent
Thomas Cook says Austria has been its number one destination for skiing
holidays this year.
Austria is divided into provinces, and each applies the law in its own way -
so property regulations vary from area to area. One British woman involved
in selling Austrian property says: 'It is a strange country. They arrange
the rules as they go along.
'I am not saying there are no ways around the rules, but they try to control
their area and do not want huge units. They are very insular and protective
of their country. But they are charming people.'
For a foreigner thinking of buying an Austrian property, what might you get
at the upper level?
Peter Marschall, of E.  M. Chalupa in Vienna, says: 'In the eastern part of
Austria, particularly Vienna, it is no problem for foreigners to buy
property. But in the western part, especially the Tyrol and other skiing and
holiday areas, it is very difficult.'
Marschall suggests three properties available to non-Austrians offered by
his agency in association with Sotheby's International Realty. One is Villa
am Gallitzinberg, in a popular residential district 15 minutes from Vienna
city centre. It is a 1960s house, modernised extensively, with 10 reception
rooms and five bedrooms.
There is accommodation for staff plus a colourful indoor swimming pool and
garaging for 10 cars. For the summer, there is an outdoor pool, too. Price:
Pounds 2m.
On the outskirts of Salzburg, and also built in the 1960s (for an assistant
to Herbert von Karajan, the conductor) is Landsitz Prinzessin von Preussen.
It follows local style, blends with the countryside and has views of the
mountains and Lake Fuschi.
The main house has three reception rooms and four bedrooms, plus a staff
flat and basement party room. Guest accommodation, in the form of a
fortified tower, includes three bedrooms.
The two properties are connected by a building which houses a swimming pool
and garages, and there is a chapel in the grounds. Facilities for golf,
riding and tennis are nearby. Price: Pounds 1.7m.
Then there is the Landhaus im Ausseerland, which is being built in a country
setting an hour from Salzburg. This is a five-bedroom villa that combines
modern architecture with the regional style.
Built in four sections, the main and secondary building and garage are
connected by a glass winter garden. The guest accommodation is separate.
To the south lies Grundslee, one of Austria's most beautiful lakes. The
property, priced at Pounds 900,000, should be completed by the summer and
John Prince, of Sotheby's in London, says non-nationals should have no legal
problems acquiring it.
Maria Holinski, of Wika, an agency with offices in Austria and Munich, says:
'The law about buying in Austria is the same all over, but how it is applied
is up to the province and the community.' Like other agents she complains,
wearily, that 'regulations have been changed yet again'.
In certain parts, she added, there were holiday areas which had been set
aside for second homes and could be sold to non-Austrians. But potential
foreign buyers were looking for something more individual.
Her agency has several apartments available to foreign purchasers, including
one at Badaussee, costing from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 260,000. But there
is a semi-detached house for Pounds 85,000.
Some of Wika's properties are in the province of Styria, which Holinski
calls the Lake District of Austria; they include a pied a terre at Pounds
25,000. Allow for buying costs of 10 to 12 per cent.
Leonard Anthony  Colin Essex is a British agency that specialises in
Austrian properties. It also favours Styria, where it has a branch.
'It is the second-largest and probably the most attractive province, much of
it covered with forests,' says the agency's Tony Mansfield. 'Foreigners are
allowed to buy certain types of property there.' He has homes in designated
holiday areas around the old village of Bad Mitterndorf, about an hour from
Salzburg airport.
Mansfield can offer around 40 furnished re-sale bungalows, chalets and
apartments, or apartments in small, new developments. Prices range from
Pounds 28,000 for a studio to Pounds 125,000 for a new, two-bedroom
apartment with balcony. One group of flats is in a school that is being
converted.
He says his agency sells only properties that are available to foreigners,
although everyone has to apply for permission to own. And while there is no
trouble getting a mortgage, Mansfield adds that potential British buyers
probably would get a better rate if they took out their loan in the UK.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Belarus balks at paying price of economic union with Russia:
John Lloyd considers why talks with Moscow have failed and what the future
holds for the small Slav state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt to merge the economies of Russia and Belarus appears to have
failed - because Russia's conditions were too strict for the small Slav
state. Belarus now faces a grim future as inflation soars and enterprises
run out of orders.
The breakdown in negotiations between the two countries is also an
indication that Russia is prepared to shoulder responsibility for its
neighbours' ailing economies only on terms which amount to a complete
takeover - terms which some in the Russian government believe will be
accepted by the former Soviet states sooner or later.
Belarus and Russia began negotiating earlier this year but both were careful
not to release any details. Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, governor of the Bank
of Belarus, has now revealed however, that the Russian terms included full
control over monetary expansion, the abolition of an independent national
bank and its substitution by a branch of the Russian central bank, and a
unified state budget.
Though Minsk's political leaders - the least independence- minded of the new
ruling classes in the former Soviet states - had been prepared to go a long
way in diluting their independence, they are not prepared to disappear
entirely into a Russian state, according to Mr Bogdankevich.
In an initial draft of the agreement, the Russian side had appeared willing
to consider allowing Minsk to print its own supply of roubles and to
exchange the devalued Belarussian currency one-to-one with the rouble.
According to an Interfax news agency report, research centres in Belarus
have already drawn up proposals for a radical shift away from dependence on
Russia if the deal is not signed.
The agency quotes the programme as proposing a 'Baltic and Black Sea union'
including the three former Soviet Baltic republics, Ukraine, Moldova and
some east European countries under the Nato umbrella, acting as a buffer
between Russia and the west.
The programme, which appears to be drafted in a deliberate spirit of enmity
to a Russia seen as spurning Belarus's advance, calls for the immediate
creation of a separate currency and of tight border control between the two
countries.
It also proposes dismantling 'as quickly as possible' the strategic
facilities used by Russia at Vileika and Gantsevichi. This would, say the
Belarussian experts, cost Russia Rbs150,000bn and complicate its control
over the Baltic and nuclear submarine fleets.
However, the unreality of the programme is underscored by the near collapse
of the present temporary Belarus currency, the lack of any reform in the
country and the unwillingness of the Baltic or east European states to be
associated with the former Soviet republics.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Slovak deputies topple premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slovakia enters a period of deepening political tension this weekend after
prime minister Vladimir Meciar and his government were toppled by a
no-confidence vote in the Slovak parliament yesterday. Deputies approved the
motion by 78-2 with 70 abstentions, many of them former Meciar supporters.
Mr Meciar led his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to victory in
the June 1992 Czechoslovak general elections. But he was then quickly
out-manoeuvred by the Czech leader, Mr Vaclav Klaus. The Czech refusal to
finance his demands for autonomy just short of independence forced the
Slovak leader to take this country of 5m people into an independence which
opinion polls showed only a small minority of Slovak nationalists wanted.
Since then Mr Meciar's highly personalised and aggressive political style
has lost support for him and his party against the background of a widening
gulf between living standards in the Czech republic, which has forged ahead
with market reforms, and Slovakia. The new republic came into existence in
January 1993 with a weaker economy heavily weighted towards former Comecon
markets and based largely on inefficient heavy industry. Since independence
market reforms have virtually stopped and the economy has declined further
against a background of high inflation, rising unemployment and a
depreciating currency.
Until now Mr Meciar has been able to hold on to power by force of his
personality and indecisiveness and divisions among opposition groups, of
which the most important are the former communists turned social democrats
led by Mr Peter Weiss, the Slovak Nationalist party and the Christian
Democrats.
Under the Slovak constitution President Michal Kovac is obliged to dissolve
the government and designate a leading politician to try and form a new
government. Once a new cabinet is formed it has to be approved by parliament
within 30 days.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Owen in warning to UN on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the present peace momentum in Bosnia-Hercegovina stalls, and if all three
sides appear determined to continue the war, then the United Nations should
considering pulling out, Lord Owen, co-chairman of the Geneva peace talks on
the former Yugoslavia, says in a lecture prepared for delivery last night to
the Pescatore Fondation in Luxembourg.
The UN should 'not contribute to prolonging it (the war) through a third
winter', he says.
Although he does not spell out whether the UN humanitarian aid effort helped
fuel the military machine of all three sides in Bosnia, Lord Owen, as he
suggested earlier this year, believes that aid, frequently hijacked by the
three armies, has indirectly prolonged the fighting.
As the war erupted, first in Croatia and later in Bosnia, Lord Owen says
that 'little thought was given to involving from the outset either the UN or
the Russian Federation'.
He believes the Russian's readiness to extend the consensus working
arrangements in the Security Council developed in the Gulf War, to
Yugoslavia had been taken 'too much for granted' and 'nearly came unstuck in
February 1994' when Nato issued the Bosnian Serbs with an ultimatum to
withdraw its heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or else risk air strikes.
He has little sympathy for Washington's 'role' in the present conflict - or
the European Union's belief that it was 'all too ready to prove itself as an
independent force in the field of foreign affairs'.
Indeed, Lord Owen believes there are lessons the EU can learn: the conflict
could not have been solved by the EU alone. 'Once it was clear the US would
not become involved, and therefore Nato as well, we were too slow to involve
the UN.' And second, had the threat of force - Nato air strikes, for
instance - been used early, particularly in Vukovar in late 1991, perhaps
the war would not have spread to Bosnia. But that would have required
support from the US.
The only hope for an early peace is Russia, the EU and the US working
together, he concludes.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Kravchuk may govern alone if polls fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Leonid Kravchuk of the Ukraine has told the US that he may try to
rule his economically stricken country alone, by presidential decree, should
parliamentary elections later this month fail to produce a legally
acceptable result.
Such a move, which could place Mr Kravchuk into a similar confrontation with
his parliament as President Boris Yeltsin faced in Russia last year, is now
being openly discussed by his close political advisers.
One senior adviser to the Ukrainian president said 'we are very sure the
parliamentary election (scheduled for March 27) will not produce a result.
It will be a good opportunity for Kravchuk' to 'press ahead with reforms and
stay in power until the end of his term until 1996'.
The adviser said that Mr Kravchuk had discussed the possibility of ruling
Ukraine by decree when he met President Bill Clinton in Washington on March
4.
While neither Mr Kravchuk nor the parliament has a record in radical
economic reform, the president blames parliament for blocking the few reform
measures he has tried to push through. Last year the parliament foiled an
attempt by Mr Kravchuk to loosen government control of land.
The opening Mr Kravchuk would need to run the Ukraine unhindered by
parliament arises out of a convoluted election law passed last November by
the existing parliament - elected while Ukraine was still part of the Soviet
Union.
Some 6,000 candidates have registered for the March 27 poll, an average of
13 per voting district. Under the law, to win in the first round of voting a
candidate must secure more than half the votes cast and more than half the
electorate must cast their votes.
To win in a second round of voting planned for April, the top two candidates
in any district will square off under the same rules. Mr Kravchuck's
advisers believe that this is where the new voting law is flawed and that it
will be difficult to draw more than half the electorate out to vote once and
nearly impossible for a second time.
If the president and his men are right in predicting a low voter turn-out,
parliament's electoral commission will be required by law to declare the
elections invalid, and thus potentially pave the way for presidential rule.
According to a presidential adviser, Mr Kravchuk would finally have his
opportunity to reform Ukraine's disastrous economy by decree without a
parliament to get in his way. He would also cancel June presidential
elections and convene a constituent assembly to redesign a political model -
presidential or parliamentary - for the country.
Last month Mr Kravchuk announced that he would not stand for early
presidential elections this June but this now appears to have been a tactic
to prepare the ground for cancelling presidential elections, disbanding
parliament and taking control of the country. Mr Kravchuck remains the only
Ukrainian politician put in power by popular vote since the republic became
independent.
The west is particularly concerned that Mr Kravchuk should remain in power
until an agreement to scrap its nuclear missile arsenal, signed in January
in Moscow, is completed. Ukraine's parliament has yet to approve the 1968
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, making Mr Kravchuck the sole guarantor of
the deal.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Mixed reaction to rescue plan for Air France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing the 40,000 staff of Air France were mixed in their
reaction yesterday to the rescue plan providing for FFr20bn (Pounds 2.29bn)
of state aid in return for a three-year wage freeze and 5,000 voluntary
redundancies.
Mr Christian Blanc, Air France's president, has asked for the unions' formal
reaction on March 28, but said that if he cannot get agreement from the
airline's 14 unions, he might organise a referendum.
Force Ouvriere, representing a majority of ground staff, reacted favourably,
while the communist-leaning CGT federation, complained that the government
is blackmailing it by tying the state aid to unions' approval of the plan.
The outcome may be decided by small groups, like the mechanics union which
said yesterday it wanted promotions, if not pay increases, to go ahead over
the 1994-97 period.
The government yesterday kept studiously silent in contrast to its erratic
tactics last October when it backed a more stringent plan for forced pay and
jobs cuts by Mr Bernard Attali, then the Air France president, and then
suddenly abandoned both the man and the plan.
Mr Attali yesterday published his book 'Sky Wars: Five Years at the Controls
of Air France', in which he says that if the government had just kept its
sang froid 'for a few more days', it would have beaten the Air France strike
and saved itself money. Instead, he was disavowed by the transport minister
on television on October 24, and immediately resigned.
In his book, Mr Attali defends his decision to buy Air Inter and increase
control over Air Inter, decisions which are implicitly criticised in the
Blanc plan as helping plunge the airline deeper into the red.
Rejecting the premise of the Attali rescue plan, Mr Blanc has said that
staffing and pay levels 'are not the problem at Air France, which is one of
organisation and structure'. 'I want to do away with this myth that the
productivity difference between Air France and BA is based on the number of
personnel and level of pay.'
Recalculating BA's workforce to include work that the UK carrier has
contracted out but which the French airline still does in-house, Mr Blanc
said that in 1992 BA effectively had staff of 49,000 and Air France 44,000.
BA thus had a workforce 11 per cent larger than Air France, but turnover
which was 21 per cent bigger. The planned 10 per cent cut in Air France
staff from 40,000 now to 44,000 by 1997 would give Air France the same ratio
of staff to turnover as BA.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Administration assails media over Whitewater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The White House yesterday denounced the mainstream media for giving credence
to unsubstantiated Whitewater rumours that have moved the financial markets
this week.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, presidential press secretary, took particular exception to
a chain of events on Thursday. This started with an obscure conservative
newsletter in Washington which raised new doubts, but offered no evidence,
about the suicide last summer of Vincent Foster, the former deputy legal
counsel.
This was immediately picked up by Rush Limbaugh, the popular right-wing talk
show host, and graduated immediately to the markets, where US bonds and the
dollar took a hammering. Versions of the rumour were reported mostly in
yesterday's newspaper money market columns as a factor influencing trading
sentiment.
Ms Myers said: 'I think anybody who may have lost money yesterday should
blame David Smick (co-publisher of the newsletter) and Rush Limbaugh. The
report was completely irresponsible and unsubstantiated. There is not a
shred of credible evidence to suggest that it is true.'
She accused the Reuters news agency of being 'one of the worst offenders'
because its market reports had noted the rumour - along with denials from
the White House and other sources. But it prompted a flurry of questions
from other news organisations. 'Since when are we in the position of having
to prove a negative?' she asked. 'I think we should pause and ask why.'
Market interest in the Whitewater affair has suddenly grown keen this week.
The FT office in Washington has received, for the first time, several calls
from financial institutions seeking either additional information or to
verify the many rumours circulating. They have been disappointed.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, newly installed White House legal counsel, and Mr David
Gergen, the presidential counsellor, both took comfort in the fact that
legal proceedings had begun to investigate possible interference by
administration officials in the inquiries into the failed Arkansas savings
and loan company at the centre of the Whitewater affair.
Mr Cutler said of Thursday's first round of grand jury testimony: 'It may
look bad, but when it becomes clear exactly what happens in those meetings I
don't think it amounts to very much.'
Mr Gergen referred to 'a difficult day', but added that he thought people
would be 'comforted by the fact that the president has made it very plain
that this White House will be co-operative, honest, forthright, and
aggressively so'.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Former minister is arrested in Tokyo: Nakamura to face
bribery charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A former Japanese construction minister yesterday became the first national
politician to be arrested in the country's biggest corruption scandal since
the second world war.
Mr Kishiro Nakamura was denied his wish to be arrested on the steps of
parliament, and instead humbly gave himself up at the Tokyo prosecutors'
office, to face bribery charges.
His arrest was triggered by a national assembly vote, at the public
prosecutor's request, to lift Mr Nakamura's parliamentary immunity, the
first time parliament has been asked to do this for 27 years.
It marks a new level in the legal assault on corruption which has led to the
arrest of more than 30 people, including local politicians, executives from
Japan's seven leading construction groups and the head of a paper company.
It is also a fresh stain on the already tarnished political image of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party, of which Mr Nakamura was a rising star
until he resigned from it on Wednesday.
Speculation has grown recently that the prosecutors would turn to a national
figure, on the grounds that they have ample evidence from their many
detainees and are under pressure to appease public disgust with political
corruption. Mr Nakamura is expected to deny charges that he received Y10m
(Pounds 63,600) from Kajima, a leading construction group, to ensure that a
public inquiry into bid-rigging in the construction industry came to
nothing.
He was construction minister in Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government from
December 1992 until last August. However, Mr Nakamura is accused of
receiving the bribe in early 1992, as chairman of the LDP's anti-trust
panel. If found guilty, he could face up to five years' imprisonment.
The construction industry has been a generous source of often illicit cash
for leading political parties, exposed with the arrest last March of Mr Shin
Kanemaru, political godfather of the LDP and patron of Mr Nakamura.
Mr Kanemaru's downfall triggered the chain of events that led to the
collapse of the LDP government last July and the adoption of laws to curb
political funding and reform the electoral system. Mr Kanemaru is now facing
trial for evading tax of Y1.8bn of construction industry donations.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Toshio's tourists turn a pretty profit: A businessman's
novel way of beating Japanese high prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Toshio Miyaji is a popular man. He's setting off from Tokyo to London and
Paris on Monday and more than 10,000 women want to go with him. The 100 he
chose to accompany him he picked out of a hat.
The reasons for Mr Miyaji's unusual attraction are not too hard to find. Not
only is the 64-year-old Japanese shopkeeper paying for the women's travel
and accommodation, he is also giving them Y500,000 (some Pounds 3,000) each
to spend on luxury goods in the most expensive stores Paris and London can
offer.
Mr Miyaji's intentions are strictly honourable. He's out to make money. The
differences in the prices of luxury goods in Europe and Japan are so great
that, in spite of the costs of a week's stay, he can resell the goods in
Tokyo at a profit.
Mr Miyaji knows he can make a profit on the trip because he has done it
before. At the beginning of last year, he led two-thirds of his 60 employees
on a free trip to Paris to buy Louis Vuitton and Chanel handbags.
'Last time the accommodation and flight cost Y470,000 per person and I only
made Y880,000 on the whole journey,' says Mr Miyaji. This time he has hotel
and airline sponsorship. 'It's only costing me Y200,000 for each housewife.'
Although he may be popular in Tokyo, Mr Miyaji is less well esteemed among
Europe's luxury goods makers. When last in Paris he found his photograph
posted up in a Louis Vuitton store. 'They didn't want to sell to me,' he
complains.
Lipstick is one of the main objectives of his latest journey. 'The
difference in prices is outrageous. A Chanel lipstick costs Y3,500 in Tokyo,
but only Y1,500 in Paris. A poll showed that 82 per cent of Japanese women
want to wear foreign lipstick, but a law dating back 50 years limits imports
to 10 per cent of the market.
'Women represent 70 per cent of my customers and I want to do something for
them,' claims Mr Miyaji. 'I'm going to import the lipstick back into Japan
and sell it at a discount. That's punishable by two years in jail. But I'm
prepared to go to jail. It's bad to violate laws, but I'm resolved to fight
an inappropriate ones. Unless I do so, consumers will continue to suffer
high prices.'
Mr Miyaji does not expect to go to jail. He has built up a formidable retail
empire, Jonan Denki, by pushing the authorities and Japanese manufacturing
establishment just so far.
In just 20 years, he created a Y12bn-a-year chain of six Tokyo stores
through aggressive discounting.
Jonan Denki is built on cash. Mr Miyaji's shambolic office, littered with
Chanel eau de toilette, cheap star-shaped transparent plastic clocks, and
the odd bottle of Russian vodka and brandy, is also adorned by an automatic
cash counting machine of the kind usually found in banks. As he pushes a
handful of money from his wallet through the machine, he proudly claims the
machine is the only one operated by a retail store in Tokyo. The wad comes
to a disappointing Y300,000.
Mr Miyaji's explains his ultimate objective is not to make money, but to
create a revolution in retailing.
'The Berlin wall may have fallen. But here in Japan nothing alters. We must
force change,' he says. At the vanguard of his struggle will be 100
housewives wielding lipstick.

FT  12 MAR 94 / IRA believes attacks will lead to Ulster concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JIMMY BURNS and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, indicated yesterday that the IRA
believes it can win further political concessions from the British
government by keeping up its campaign of violence.
As a security review at Heathrow airport was completed following two mortar
attacks in less than 36 hours, Mr Adams said that the incidents 'should have
a major accelerating effect upon the British government'. On Thursday, he
had warned of more 'spectacular' reminders that the conflict was continuing.
His latest remarks came as the row intensified over security at Heathrow and
Scotland Yard confirmed it had undertaken a thorough review of security
arrangements at the airport.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, yesterday issued a defiant joint statement saying the 'men of
violence' would not deflect the two governments in their search for peace.
With some Tory MPs demanding a security crackdown on the IRA and Labour
accusing ministers of 'delay, neglect and wrong priorities' over airport
security, the two leaders accused supporters of violence of making 'a grave
miscalculation' and committed the security forces to a continuing
anti-terrorist drive.
As well as an increase in the number of police, options being considered as
a result of the Heathrow security review are thought to include increased
video surveillance and temporary road blocks. The Ministry of Defence said
last night that the army was prepared to help patrol the airport.
Anti-terrorist experts are trying to establish why mortars fired on Heathrow
in the two attacks failed to detonate. One theory is that they were designed
not to explode on impact, generating publicity but minimising the political
risk of large-scale casualties.
Balpa, the pilots' union, said it had launched its own investigation into
apparent security lapses at the airport. Pilots are concerned that after the
first mortar attack on the airport's northern runway on Wednesday night,
more than 20 aircraft were allowed to take off before it was closed. BAA
said last night that Heathrow was fully operational.
The British Tourist Authority reported little reaction to the attacks. Mr
Stuart Crouch, chairman of the British Incoming Tour Operators' Association,
said he had received no reports of foreign visitors cancelling UK trips.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Trade gap grows as recovery pulls in more imports: Deficit
fears hit sterling as receding hope of rate cuts depresses shares and bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade gap widened abruptly in December, as the recovering economy
drew in more imports than expected.
Strong import volumes of a broad range of goods, combined with particularly
poor exports to the European Union, increased the visible deficit to Pounds
1.57bn in December from Pounds 1.28bn in November. The Central Statistical
Office said the underlying trend also pointed to a growing visible deficit.
The spectre of a widening trade gap as growth gathers speed put downward
pressure on the pound, which fell almost 1 1/2 pfennigs yesterday to close
in London at DM2.521.
Robust imports in the last quarter of 1993 - underlying volumes were up 3.5
per cent on the previous quarter against a 3 per cent drop in exports -
added to evidence that recovery is well established, reducing hopes of an
early cut in interest rates.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, backed up this view in
Washington when he dismissed the need for 'an artificial stimulus' to spur
growth.
This sentiment helped depress gilts and London share prices. The FT-SE 100
index fell 42 to 3,191.9, its lowest close this year, for a loss this week
of 86.1.
Mr George, questioned by reporters after speaking at an international
banking conference in Washington on Thursday, said UK economic growth could
pick up to an annual rate of 3 per cent over the next 18 months. That is a
higher rate than the Treasury's official forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in
gross domestic product in 1994 and the first half of 1995.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said that 'one of the
messages of today's trade data was that the economy was uncomfortably firm
at the end of last year'.
Adding to unease about the UK's tendency to satisfy domestic demand through
imports was the news from the CSO that revisions to EU trade figures for the
first 11 months of 1993 had added an extra Pounds 750m to imports, but only
Pounds 40m to exports.
The CSO warned that the latest figures should be treated with caution, given
the continuing problems of the new system for monitoring intra-EU trade
flows. Many economists suspect that Intrastat - the new method - has
systematically underestimated imports. These revisions appear to confirm
those fears.
For 1993 as a whole, the UK's visible trade deficit was Pounds 13.42bn,
little changed from 1992's Pounds 13.4bn. It was nonetheless Pounds 2bn more
than the government forecast in November's Budget.
The widening of the trade gap in December was wholly due to a sharp
deterioration in trade with the rest of the EU. The deficit widened from a
sharply revised Pounds 543m in November to Pounds 903m.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said the increase in the deficit in
December was not surprising given the continued recession in continental
Europe, the UK's biggest market. Exports to Europe, excluding oil and
erratic items, fell 9.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1993. Imports rose 3
per cent in the period. The Treasury warned against reading too much into
the figures.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Treasury urges prompt sale of nuclear power industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is pressing hard for Britain's nuclear generation industry to
be privatised before the next election, with incentives for managers to keep
down the huge costs of decommissioning power stations.
In the run-up to the nuclear review, which the Department of Trade and
Industry hopes to announce in the next few weeks, the Treasury has thrown
its support behind privatising Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear within
two years.
It believes new legislation would not be needed for the nuclear industry
sell-off, which could be covered by electricity privatisation measures
approved by parliament in the late 1980s.
Britain's nuclear power stations were withdrawn from privatisation five
years ago because of fears that shareholders could face big liabilities from
the cost of decommissioning plants and dealing with waste.
Nuclear Electric was subsequently established to manage the English and
Welsh generating industry in the public sector while Scottish Nuclear was
set up to run the two Scottish plants.
Treasury ministers reject the need to separate out from Nuclear Electric the
older Magnox stations, the first to be withdrawn from the sale of the
electricity industry.
They want Nuclear Electric to be sold off as one unit, although they may
consider reallocating some of its plants to Scottish Nuclear to make it more
viable as a stand-alone company in the private sector.
There are strong doubts in the City that the industry can be privatised with
Magnox liabilities, particularly as a way still has to be found of splitting
the decommissioning and waste costs associated with the public sector from
those of the private sector.
To minimise costs, running into billions of pounds, the Treasury is looking
to the nuclear review to generate 'innovative measures' to build in
incentives to keep liabilities to a minimum.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is known to be more cautious than the
Treasury. Although he believes the future of the nuclear industry is in the
private sector, he is understood to question if a quick privatisation is
practical.
After the abrupt halt called to the sale of the nuclear industry 1989, the
DTI wants to ensure that the second attempt to get the industry into the
private sector is not bungled by being rushed.
The Treasury which believes the government will gain nothing by standing
still, wants a decision to sell off Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear to
be made by the summer.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (1): Tunnel to increased
value - The Chunnel is about to change life in northern France and Kent.
Gerald Cadogan looks at the implications for the property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On May 6 the Queen and President Mitterrand will declare the Channel Tunnel
open. That should be the starting signal for a recovery in the property
market in Kent and north eastern France.
At the moment, agents report more inquiries, but the markets in both
countries are still quiet and prices low, especially in France. That is an
excellent long-term reason to buy.
Le Shuttle's high starting prices for a vehicle and its passengers will
eventually come down creating price competition between rail, ferry,
catamaran and Hovercraft.
Far-sighted prospective buyers looking near Calais include hauliers wanting
to set up a base on the Continent, and Asian entrepreneurs who see an
advantage in being close to Belgium. John Hart, author of A House in France,
notes: 'It is not a rush. The tunnel does not mean much to the continentals.
Most of the ferry trade is from Britain to France.'
The British are mainly looking for houses, rather than apartments, although
French and Dutch buyers are also in the market. Inquiries about northern
French property picked up just before Christmas, says Maggie Kelly, of
French agents L'Abri-tanique in Hesdin.
Growing confidence in the UK market is slowly stimulating interest in French
property. UK buyers can now sell their UK home to put money into a main
residence or second home in France. Prices have stopped falling in northern
France and hopes are high that the tunnel, motorways and new railways will
resuscitate the region.
Britons who bought in 1989 or 1990 may find it a good time to sell, if they
did not pay too much at the time and have renovated their properties since.
But some paid far too much.
Spectacular price cuts can be found. For example, a glorious, repossessed
abbey with five acres in Tortefontaine, with a 12th century hall and many
outbuildings, is on sale at around FFr750,000 (Pounds 86,000) from agents
Latitudes or L'Abri-tanique. Four or five years ago it cost FFr2.5m (after
being put on the market at FFr4m). A mill near Montreuil, which cost FFr2m
in 1989, sold last year for FFr500,000.
French banks and mortgage providers have taken it 'on the chin', said Kelly,
and some smaller banks in Calais are none too happy when Britons seek loans.
However, show you have the cash and there are bargains to be had. A house in
Hesdin, or a nearby country cottage, make good weekend retreats and are far
cheaper than their English equivalents.
A small house in Montreuil, a walled town with cobbled streets, costs
FFr280,000 from La Residence. A small, partly-restored farmhouse near
Montreuil can be bought for FFr135,000 from A House in France. Thirty
minutes' drive from Boulogne, a long, low, Norman-style, half-timbered,
farmhouse is for sale at FFr515,250, and 50 minutes away another costs
FFr436,800 (reduced from FFr650,000).
Near St Omer agent Cote d'Opale is selling an 18th century chateau with
wings added in 1908 for FFr4.46m. La Residence offers another with 28
watercress beds and 12 hectares (30 acres) in good condition for FFr2.6m and
a flat in town for FFr380,000.
In Hesdin, the Wine Society, an English-based group of wine enthusiasts, has
an outlet for members where they can pick up society-recommended wines free
of UK taxes.
When Kelly sees Range Rover and Jaguar drivers collecting their cases of
wine in Hesdin, she would like them to drop into her office 100 metres away
and choose a house as well.
Latitudes has on its books an 18th century town house with internal
courtyard for FFr1.3m, a snip when you think what you would pay in Paris.
Near Fruges is a water mill for FFr900,000 and, in the valley of the
Ternoise, an 18th century brick house needing work is available for just
FFr450,000.
On the coast, Boulogne is a smart, pleasant town far preferable to Calais.
It has good shops - including the Philippe Olivier cheese shop  - and
restaurants. The French favourite is Le Touquet, still an elegant place for
Parisians to spend le weekend. Shops open in winter on Saturdays and Sundays
 -and close on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings. You can play golf and
tennis, ride, go to the casino and live in an elegant domaine in the Foret.
As in Deauville, the town's cachet has kept prices up. Penny Zoldan, of
Latitudes, has a flat in Le Touquet and sees it as a good base for
foreigners.
Nearby, at Hardelot, there are plenty of building plots for sale beside the
two golf courses (consult Latitudes). Outside Le Touquet, A House in France
offers a chateau complete with fortification wall and tunnels for FFr1.3m.
In the countryside beyond Dieppe, a typical Norman house, restored and
including most of the furniture and a cottage, is for sale for Pounds
125,000 from Domus Abroad.
Towards Paris, off the autoroute from Calais, Philip Hawkes is selling the
18th century Chateau de Pronleroy for FFr13m. Egerton and Knight Frank 
Rutley is offering the more recent Chateau de la Chaussee, near Chantilly,
the centre of French racing, at FFr19m.
At the other end of the tunnel Cluttons reports Belgians and Dutch
registering at the Canterbury office for period cottages for around Pounds
200,000, and French and Belgians at the Folkestone office - where David
Parry reports that Arabs are interested in blocks of flats on the sea front.
'The tunnel has more psychological impact than anything. Vendors see it as a
bonus. Buyers don't see that yet.'
Once the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the area
and people will move in. Central and east Kent need a stimulus but it may
take four or five years before there is any evidence of new opportunities in
the area.
An apartment in The Grand at Folkestone, the former hotel, is for sale from
Cluttons for Pounds 89,500. Along the M2, Strutt  Parker offers 52 St
Margaret's Street, Rochester, a Grade II* late 17th century house, for
Pounds 190,000, and a Tudor (1508) and Georgian Kentish hall, Cobrahamsole
Hall at Sheldwich near Faversham for Pounds 275,000. Lane Fox is selling the
half-timbered Manor Farmhouse at Milstead, near Sittingbourne, for Pounds
275,000.
In the old Cinque Port of Deal, Strutt  Parker and Bright  Bright offer
Woodbine, a Georgian house with walled garden and studio, for Pounds
330,000. Cluttons' Canterbury office and Weatherall Green  Smith are
selling Highland Court, at Bridge, a columned stately home, for Pounds
750,000.
The far-sighted are buying now, either side of La Manche. The value in
France is formidable. And it is not bad in Kent.

FT  12 MAR 94 / German union accepts 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's largest public sector union accepted a pay rise below the rate of
inflation for its 3.5m members yesterday, improving prospects of a round of
low wage increases across the country.
The OTV union accepted a rise of 2 per cent, against inflation projected at
around 3 per cent this year. In addition, civil servants will give up the
traditional 13th month of extra pay at Christmas for the next three years.
The deal, which follows a series of token strikes, was reached after 40
hours of talks in Stuttgart between union negotiators and interior ministry
officials. Within hours of the OTV deal being announced, IG Metall -
Germany's largest union, representing 3.6m engineering workers - secured
agreement from its members for a below-inflation pay increase negotiated by
the leadership last week.
IG Metall workers in the state of Lower Saxony voted overwhelmingly to
accept the deal, which has already been agreed by almost all other union
regions, thus heading off threatened strikes in the engineering sector. The
deal is seen as the benchmark for remaining pay talks this year.
In the public sector agreement, civil servants in lower pay brackets, in
particular in eastern Germany, will receive their rise from July 1, while
middle-ranking and senior officials will be paid at the higher rate two
months later. The deal will run for 15 months starting January 1 1994.
The agreement was accepted overwhelmingly by the OTV union's 210-strong wage
commission, after being recommended by the negotiating team. It includes
greater flexibility for workers taking time off in lieu of overtime.
Meanwhile, IG Medien, the print union, said its members staged a second day
of warning strikes across the country. About 400,000 workers made token
stoppages at about 50 plants, the union said.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Lafarge Coppee rises 26% for
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lafarge Coppee, the French construction materials group, yesterday announced
a 26 per cent increase in net profit, to FFr1.55bn (Dollars 267.2m), for
1993. Turnover was slightly lower at FFr30.43bn. It is holdings its net
dividend at FFr9 per share.
The group benefited last year from the return to profit of its American
subsidiary, Lafarge Corporation and from a better return on its investments
in central Europe. These offset the effects of recession in France.
It predicted that the strengthening of its capital base would continue, with
a possible FFr1.3bn increase in shareholder funds from the conversion of
bonds and another FFr1.5bn from exercised share warrants.
As a result, the group said it planned to step up investments this year, to
between FFr5bn and FFr7bn, from FFr5.5bn this year. This was to increase its
presence on particularly promising international markets around the
Mediterranean, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Bertrand Collomb, president, said the group had been prospecting the
Chinese market, which seemed re-opened to French companies following Paris's
promise to Peking to sell no more offensive arms to Taiwan.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior French and Italian magistrates and police yesterday met in the
southern French town of Aix-en-Provence to exchange information on fighting
organised crime.
The French justice ministry played down the significance of the meeting's
timing, planned five months ago. But it comes after last month's
gangster-style assassination of Mrs Yann Piat, a French MP who had crusaded
against corruption in the Var department. Two men are being held by French
police, but dozens of others, including local politicians, have also been
questioned.
According to one theory, Mrs Piat's death was a revenge killing for the
gunning down of a French underworld figure a year ago in Italy.
The two-day meeting in Aix reflects growing concern that the Mafia may be
spreading its activities into southern France, because of lucrative
investment opportunities in casinos and real estate and because it is under
increasing police pressure at home. Leading the Italian side at the Aix
meeting is Mrs Liliana Ferraro, the judge in charge of the Italian
government's fight against the Mafia.
Mr Charles Pasqua, last night campaigning in Nice for a conservative
candidate in Sunday's parliamentary election in the city, has promised to
clean up the Riviera. Last week he was presented with a report recommending
the creation of regional squads specialised in fighting organised crime.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UN chiefs desperate for extra troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extra troops promised yesterday by Britain and other countries must be
dispatched to Bosnia as soon as possible, UN officials in Zagreb warned last
night.
They said the troops, which fall short of the 4,600 needed for Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, and an extra 6,050 for central Bosnia, are desperately
needed to shore up the fragile ceasefire, reinstate vital services for
several cities, and speed up the deliveries of aid convoys throughout the
country. There are alrady 13,000 troops stationed in the republic.
'The sooner these troops come the better,' said Lieutenant Commander Jean
Marcotte, the UN's army spokesman in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
In Sarajevo, the troops are needed to implement the ceasefire as well as
finally start de-militarising the capital. In addition, General Sir Michael
Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, requires a support unit and an engineer
unit of 2,200 men to back up the troops, help rebuild local services, and
start clearing mines.
Elsewhere in Bosnia, General Rose wants additional forces to monitor the
ceasefire, but also help repair roads crucial for sending in aid convoys.
More important, any extra troops will be deployed to new 'safe areas', in
particular the besieged Moslem enclave of Maglaj, which Bosnian Serb forces
continue to bombard, as well as prevent UN aid convoys from delivering
supplies.
No supplies have reached this 20,000-strong enclave for several months.
'You can see the sense of urgency about sending the troops. The forces we
have are already stretched,' a UN official said. 'Also, you must remember
that the British forces in central Bosnia have to patrol a ceasefire line
which is over 300 kilometres long. That requires a lot of manpower.'
In Sarajevo alone, the ceasefire perimeter exceeded at least 200km.
'These lines have to be manned twenty-four hours a day on a three-shift
system. I just hope we can manage with the extra thousand or so which we
will be receiving soon,' a UN official added.
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said
earlier this week that about 50,000 troops were needed to oversee any
eventual political settlement for the republic.
Western diplomats in New York said several countries, including Pakistan and
Bangladesh, have already offered troops. But the problem is that they do not
have the equipment. 'Germany and Austria have agreed in principle to equip
them,' a diplomat at the UN headquarters said last night.
Germany, for constitutional reasons cannot send troops outside Nato
territory; neither can Austria for historical reasons and because it is a
neighbouring state.
'The problem with accepting the Pakistani or Bangladeshi offer, however
welcome, is that they will not be ready for deployment until June. Ideally,
we would prefer countries from Nato because they can react quickly and in
many circumstances, share the same command/training structures.'
Yet even once the troops are deployed, the UN is still faced with another
problem: will any troops redeployed from Croatia ever be replaced.
Over 10,000 troops have been stationed in Croatia in UN protected areas,
which Serb forces seized from Croatia during the war in 1991.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (16): Dizzying descent begins to
slow - It is clear that the worst is finally over for Sweden, although
recovery remains elusive / Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The descent has been dizzying but at last it is beginning to slow. Having
dropped further than most other European property markets during the 1990s,
it is clear that the worst is finally over for Sweden. Recovery, though,
remains elusive, particularly for the commercial property sector. Vacancy
rates are still extremely high and rents, with few exceptions, are
declining.
The continuing oversupply means that the commercial property sector will
only gradually stabilise. But, in contrast to a year ago, at least there are
some encouraging signs.
Yields are falling for the first time since 1989, if only because of lower
interest rates. Companies are not going bankrupt at anything like the rate
that they were, slowing the flow of additional properties onto the market.
And companies and public sector organisations are moving back into central
Stockholm again, after a big exodus to peripheral regions of the city,
helping to push rent levels up slightly.
Some stabilisation is not surprising given that capital values and rental
prices have more than halved in Stockholm since their 1990 peak. In the
centre of the city, rents of SKr1,500-2,000 a sq m are typical, compared
with SKr3,500-4,000 four years ago.
A number of external factors are helping to arrest the decline. They include
a sharp drop in Swedish interest rates since late 1992, gathering evidence
of a general economic recovery and clear signs that the worst of the Swedish
banking crisis is over.
The return of stability to the financial sector has helped to calm the
property market because collapsing real estate values were at the heart of
the Swedish banking crisis, forcing banks to seize hundreds of properties
both at home and abroad after loans to real estate companies went sour.
The melt-down resulted in Swedish financial institutions becoming some of
the country's biggest property owners, threatening to destabilise further an
already unstable situation. In fact the nightmare scenario of banks dumping
properties wholesale onto the market was avoided, thanks to the improvement
in their own fortunes - again, a product of lower interest rates - and the
nature of government intervention.
Generous state support meant 'bad bank' entities such as Securum and Retriva
were well-capitalised, ensuring they did not have to dispose of properties
into a declining market.
'Contrary to what certain people feared, the equivalent of two or three
years' turnover of property stock was prevented from flooding the market,'
says Mr Erik Persson, research and development director with Catella, a
property consulting group.
Those who believe the market is about to turn base their optimism on a
number of factors.
First, the residential market is in a clear recovery phase, thanks to much
lower mortgage rates and a gradual loosening of the rent control system.
Secondly, commercial property yields have begun to fall: having peaked at
between 7 and 8 per cent in 1992-3, they are now below 7 per cent.
Thirdly, property company share prices have begun to outperform the stock
market. Indeed, the strong stock market run suggests it may only be a matter
of time before investors switch some funds out of equities into other areas,
including property.
Finally, foreigners are showing a growing interest in the market, enticed by
low prices and the weak krona. A German pension fund has paid SKr285m for a
large property in northern Stockholm, while an affiliate of Credit Lyonnais,
Altus Nord, has been active in both Stockholm and Gothenburg.
'I expect international buyers will make some large investments before the
summer,' says Mr Jan Wejdmark, managing director of Ljungquist
Fastighetsvarderingar.
Yet reasons for believing that any recovery will be slow are plentiful.
Office vacancies are still rising in most locations and rents are declining.
This is because unemployment continues to climb and companies are using
space more efficiently. In some areas of Stockholm vacancy rates are as high
as 15 to 20 per cent.
'You can see from looking at other international cities that if vacancies
are more than 10 per cent, then rents will normally go down,' says Mr
Wejdmark.
It is also difficult to see who the new breed of property investors will be.
Some of the big players of the late 1980s, such as insurance groups, got
their fingers so badly burned that they are likely to be far more cautious
about investing in property in the future.
Not surprisingly, development activity has shrunk to a fraction of earlier
levels. In Stockholm as little as 30,000-40,000 sq m will be completed
during 1994, compared with as much as 400,000 sq m a year at the market
peak.
Yet with interest rates set to fall further this year, the prospects for
recovery look better today than at any time in the past five years. But the
revival will be slow if only because of the number of properties waiting to
find a new home.
Swedish financial institutions are estimated to have taken over properties
worth between SKr60bn and SKr80bn during the bank crisis. Even this may not
slow the recovery too much, because it is only equivalent to one-two years
of normal turnover.
'If you press down an air-filled ball into the water for long enough, it
will eventually bounce back up again,' says Mr Persson.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (15): Construction cranes will
be back - Two grand business property developments are good indicators of
what is going on in Madrid's property market / Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big business property developments tend to have grandiose names and those in
Spain are no exception to the rule.
The Gateway to Europe, at the northern edge of Madrid's central axis, the
broad Castellana boulevard, is one grand example and the Field of Nations,
just beyond the city's limits and close to the airport is another. Both are
good indicators of what has happened, what is happening and what is likely
to happen to the Spanish capital's property market.
The Gateway, which consists of two 46-storey office blocks that lean towards
each other, is better known in Madrid as the KIO towers after the Kuwait
Investment Office whose company, Prima Inmobiliaria, began to build them
when the property market was booming in the late 1980s.
The company, together with the KIO's main Spanish investment arm, went into
receivership in December 1992 and the half-completed Gateway was finally
acquired at a bargain price a year later by a syndicate of domestic
financial groups and by FCC, a leading construction company.
The Field of Nations, a 90,000 sq m business park which includes Madrid's
main trade fair centre, has gradually come on stream in the past four years
and is now up and running and virtually filled up. Recently, an insurance
company, Genesis, which is jointly owned by Metropolitan Life of the US and
by Banco Santander, the leading domestic bank, acquired an 8,000 sq m block
in the park, one of the last available locations.
The acquisition by Genesis appeared to indicate a trend. 'If a bank like
Santander, which knows the market very well, is buying freehold it means
that the office market has bottomed out,' says Mr John Baines, chief
executive of real estate company Healey and Baker in Madrid.
In recent months, Procter and Gamble, Unysis, Bull and the domestic energy
company Cepsa have rented large areas of office space in the Campo. Richard
Ellis, which together with Healey and Baker is a leading player in the
domestic property market, believes that suburbs - and particularly business
parks - stand to gain as companies seek to relocate because of potentially
rising leasehold costs in older city-centre buildings.
The costs could rise sharply for companies with pre-1985 leases which will
be deregulated when a new Urban Leasehold Act comes into force later this
year. The act would have been on the statute book last year but was
postponed when parliament was dissolved and new elections held.
The increased expense will be a distinct change for rental prices have come
down strongly, by as much as 40 per cent in some buildings. Early in 1993,
the supply of offices along the 'prime prime' Castellana boulevard axis
outstripped demand, something which, Richard Ellis points out, 'nobody could
have imagined'.
But then again few expected that the Spanish economy would fall so fast and
so deeply into a recession midway through 1992. The painful shrinkage of the
GDP came to a halt in the third quarter of last year and a moderate but
sustained expansion is in place and will become evident in the second half
of the current year.
On the property market, the cycle appeared to be distinctly changing before
the end of last year. Healey and Baker estimates that vacancy rates along
the Castellana central business area will drop in the course of this year to
a mere 6 per cent and there is a general consensus in the market that office
rents are set to rise.
The ownership troubles that afflicted the Gateway, or the KIO towers, could
consequently have been a blessing in disguise. Work has restarted on the two
blocks after an interval of nearly 18 months and they are likely to be
completed and ready for occupation in the spring of next year - just when
office space demand is expected to be growing strongly.
In Barcelona, where there is less demand for large office locations (the
great majority of corporate headquarters in Spain are in Madrid), demand
will pick up more moderately. Starting rental prices are similar in both
cities but the vacancy rates in Barcelona are appreciably higher than those
in Madrid.
International investors are mostly quiet in the office sector but there is
increasing activity in retail properties and particularly in shopping
centres. The latter have mushroomed all over Spain with good results but
there is room for more growth.
The retail excitement will prod the office sector into activity sooner
rather than later. A key factor in this is that interest rates have come
down fast in Spain over the past eight months and are set to fall further in
the months ahead. Developers can now acquire three-year, medium-term finance
at around 8.5 per cent and it is a sure bet that the big construction
cranes, which used to be such a permanent feature of Spanish city skylines,
will be back.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (14): Demand runs further ahead
of supply - A new constitution adopted last December enshrines inalienable
private property rights for the first time in post-Soviet history / Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Russia has made strides to strengthen fledgling property rights over the
past year, demand has outstripped the supply of property in Moscow, the
centre of the country's real estate market, by more than ever before.
A new constitution adopted in a referendum last December after President
Boris Yeltsin crushed a parliamentary uprising enshrines inalienable private
property rights for the first time in post-Soviet history. A presidential
decree dating from October - which has yet to be submitted to a parliament
which may reject it - allows for the unhindered sale and purchase of land
except by foreigners, who can only do so in partnership with Russian
companies.
Under the old constitution, the re-sale of land was subject to a 10-15 year
moratorium. As privatisation has gathered pace, there have also been more
opportunities to buy property from owners who have acquired clear title to
it.
But because it is largely due to a shortage of quality space, the increase
in unsatisfied demand has been in spite of, rather than because of, the
progress with legislation.
'There is more order in the system than less. That still does not mean it is
an ordered system, but it means we are vaguely heading in the right
direction,' says Mr Adrian Moore, in charge of property deals at the Moscow
office of solicitors Norton Rose.
Mr Moore says that some of the new property business comes from foreign
companies such as his own which began leasing small amounts of space as 'an
experiment' and then decided to take larger premises as their business
expanded in Moscow.
A lot of the development is generated by new Russian companies and banks
which are more at ease with the system than foreigners. A popular source of
enrichment for underpaid officials has been the bribes paid by businessmen
wishing to acquire property at exceptionally low prices and make a killing
from its subsequent development.
In theory, foreign companies and individuals can own buildings outright.
They can also lease land but not own it except when it is attached to a
privatised enterprise.
But while picking one's way through the labyrinthine Russian bureaucracy in
order to obtain 'good title' is possible and creates good business for
lawyers, western real estate developers say life remains tough.
Apart from the red tape and the background fears that political instability
could one day lead to expropriation, it remains extremely difficult for
developers to raise finance on the strength of Russian property projects.
Mr Moore says the main obstacle is the absence of a system for registering a
lender's legal charge, or his right to realise his security. 'The key thing
any lender is looking for is to register the fact they made the loan and can
take valid security over something like the development'.
Mr Haluk Gercek, in charge of the Moscow office of Enka, the Turkish
construction company which has been able to bring its own funds and bank
finance to Russian projects, believes the main problem is psychological.
After 70 years of communism, Mr Gercek finds that many Russians have only a
faint grasp of such concepts as private property, venture capital and
investment. 'You can't fix this with laws and regulations. It is a matter of
long-term acceptance of property rights and private ownership. People think
they are doing you a favour if they offer you investment opportunities
without offering security for your capital.'
As an example of Russian attitudes to what constitutes an opportunity, he
cites Russian officials who have offered Enka buildings inhabited either by
tenants with rights to the property or illegal squatters.
Still, he believes a presence on the Russian market is essential to benefit
from its future promise. He claims that Enka is now the biggest foreign
contractor on the Russian market, and he says the company's reputation for
getting jobs done faster and more cheaply than the competition helped clinch
it a Dollars 22m contract to help rebuild the White House after it was
shelled by army tanks to quell last October's parliamentary rebellion.
Mosenka, Enka's joint venture with the Moscow city construction authorities,
has been renovating buildings on which it has a 25- to 49-year lease, and
renting them to foreigners. The scarcity of properties mean that office
space in Moscow is among the most expensive in the world, costing Dollars
800-Dollars 900 a sq m a year.
Independently of its Russian joint venture, Enka is presently studying
projects whereby the Moscow city government would give it dilapidated
buildings - which abound in the city - to renovate in return for 50 per cent
ownership of the final product - with no guarantee that this will include
the land beneath the buildings.
'We are proceeding very slowly, with foreign and Russian lawyers so we can
get as much security as possible that this won't be taken away from us
later,' says Mr Gercek.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (13): Local authorities create
problems - Difficulties with obtaining planning and building permissions are
a significant barrier to development and lead to increased costs / Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warsaw's city centre - which was largely destroyed during the second world
war and later rebuilt - still contains enough empty spaces to warm a
developer's heart. But according to Mr Michael Roskelly of Dauntons Gerald
Eve in Warsaw, the city is littered with building projects many of which are
unlikely to get past the drawing board.
'Lots of schemes are talked about but few have a future,' he says. The
reason is not lack of demand for modern office space from the steady trickle
of foreign companies attracted by Poland's growing economy. Rather, it is
the difficulty of getting all the relevant parts of a project into place,
including the financing, when dealing with local authorities which are
jealous of influence from abroad.
According to Mr Roskelly, Warsaw needs between 60,000 sq m and 70,000 sq m
of new office space a year, much of it priced at rents of Dollars 20 to
Dollars 25 a sq m.
'Banks and financial services companies want prestigious accommodation and
they could fill a couple of buildings,' he says. But larger companies are
now also coming in on tight budgets - and they want to pay the lower rents,
as do a growing number of local companies who are looking for the prestige
of western-style accommodation.
Ms Karolina Kaim from Jones Lang Wootton agrees that there is demand but not
at the top end of the market where companies are now paying up to Dollars 60
a sq m. Although about 60,000 sq m of office space came onto the market in
1993, rents have yet to start moving downwards.
Meanwhile, both Jones Lang Wootton and Dauntons Gerald Eve cite problems
with getting planning and building permissions from local authorities as a
pertinent barrier to development. The local authorities tend not to like
foreign developers so Polish architects and engineers are taken in to
provide projects with a local veneer. But they have yet to learn to
appreciate fully the commercial aspects of a project or the needs of a
western institutional client.
All this increases the soft costs which have to be incurred before planning
permission can be obtained and financing arranged.
There are also still problems with land title and the issue is especially
acute in Warsaw where owners of the ruined city were dispossessed en bloc
after the war. Successive governments have promised to resolve the problem
of restitution but a law dealing with the subject has yet to be passed by
parliament.
Nevertheless, two projects are under construction. There is the 15,000 sq m
FIM tower being built near the five-year-old LIM centre which houses 20,000
sq m of office space and the Marriott Hotel and which will soon become the
first office block to have paid for itself. And there is also the Aktyn
Business Centre, being built by Ilbau which will provide 17,000 sq m of
which 8,000 sq m will be devoted to offices.
Preliminary work has also started on two more buildings. One is the PKO BP's
business centre; the other is the Atrium, 80,000 sq m of office and retail
space which is a joint venture between the Swedish Skanska company and the
Wola district in the Polish capital.
As for hotels, a spate of building activity in the past three years has
provided a temporary surfeit of rooms at the top end of the market. Indeed,
Warsaw has enough four- and five-star hotels and now needs some well-located
three-star accommodation, according to the experts.
The Forte's Bristol Hotel, with its 207 rooms refurbished at a cost of about
Dollars 40m, is struggling to service its debt as occupancy last year
oscillated around the 50 per cent mark. Other recently-constructed hotels
include the French-run Mercure and the colourful Sobieski whose lack of air
conditioning makes it difficult to attract clients in the summer.
Shopping projects remain an underdeveloped sector of the market with the
Polish planned and built white and blue Panorama building on the route out
to the Ursynow high-rise dormitory district the only very big development in
the past five years. The building is successful and still awaits competition
from other retailing projects.
Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has a big shop on the outskirts of the
city and Makro, a Dutch wholesaler, has also had the Exbud construction
company build a large cash and carry development in a Warsaw suburb.
But in the main, foreign companies have been less adventurous, with the
Austrian Billa group, for example, putting its two supermarkets into a
disused factory building and a bus depot.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (12): Massive demand for retail
space - In contrast, the market for central Lisbon office space is suffering
from the effects of substantial oversupply / Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A striking new retail and residential centre is rising out of the ashes of
the fire that destroyed the heart of Lisbon's historic Chiado shopping
district in 1988. But it will only go a short way towards meeting the
massive demand for retail space that is currently dominating the Portuguese
property market.
Big international retailers such as Hard Rock Cafe, Virgin Records and
British Home Stores are poised to move into Portugal while established
foreign chains including McDonald's, Pizza Hut and the Spanish fashion store
Zara are expanding aggressively.
The result is that demand for prime retail sites far outstrips supply. New
rents for shops in the central Avenida da Liberdade or Chiado areas have
reached Es15,000 a sq m a month; more than three times the prices paid in
the relatively depressed office market, where supply exceeds demand.
The new Chiado development, conceived by Mr Alvaro Siza Vieira, Portugal's
most respected architect, in a style reminiscent of the original 18th
century buildings, is due to be largely completed by the end of 1995, and
will absorb only a small part of this demand. Many of the original retailers
will be entitled to reoccupy the area, with the result that only a few new
sites will come onto the market.
It will be comprised of 30 per cent office space, 30 per cent retail and 40
per cent residential. The aim in building residential apartments is to bring
new life to the city centre. Almost no one lives there at present and the
area becomes a deserted shell as soon as shops and offices close - a factor
that partly explains why the fire was already out of control before the
alarm was raised.
'Lisbon still lacks quality new shops,' says Mr George Craven, director of
Lisbon-based Sofica Savills. 'Buildings in the Chiado reconstruction are now
being completed but they stand against part-finished structures and work yet
to be begun, leaving retailers who are being asked prime rents nervous about
returning to the area.'
However, three other important developments will relieve the pressure for
retail sites over the next few years. 'The Colombus Centre, a mixed
development in the Benfica suburb of Lisbon, will place 133,000 sq m of
shopping space on the market by 1997,' says Mr Eric van Leuven, managing
director in Portugal of Healey  Baker, 'laying claim to being one of the
biggest shopping centres in Europe.'
El Corte Ingles, the Spanish department store, will take up a 30,000 sq m
anchor store in a development to be built around a new Hilton Hotel
alongside Lisbon's Eduardo VII park by 1997.
An additional 20,000 sq m will be made available for smaller shops. In the
town of Oeiras, a few miles from Lisbon, a 40,000 sq m shopping centre with
its own important catchment area should be ready by early 1996.
In contrast to the buoyant retail sector, the market for central Lisbon
office space is suffering from the effects of substantial oversupply. Rents
have fallen about 35 per cent over the past two years to a current level of
Es4,500 sq m.
Demand is strong, with an annual take-up of some 60,000 sq m that has
remained steady over the past five years. But the vacancy rate is about 6
per cent, with 100,000 sq m of new office space and 50,000 sq m of
secondhand offices unoccupied in Lisbon. This rate compares favourably with
cities such as Madrid, Paris or London but is a symptom of growing
difficulties in Lisbon where there have been no vacancies at all in recent
years.
Another 75,000 sq m of new office space is expected to come onto the Lisbon
market in 1994 and the level of new building is unlikely to diminish over
the next few years. This will push up vacancy rates, increase oversupply and
hold down rents.
Because new rents are falling closer to the level of older rents, many
companies are moving out of dilapidated, inefficient buildings in the centre
of Lisbon into more modern developments. The clear choice of multinationals
is for out-of-town or edge-of-town business parks where new rents are
currently about Es4,100 and conditions including traffic and parking are
more attractive.
'Some companies that took up offices in the late 1980s, when rents were at
their peak, are also keen to move,' says Mr van Leuven. 'Under Portuguese
law, rents rise with inflation. These companies may now be paying Es8,000 sq
m when they could rent new premises for almost half that.'
A crucial factor in stimulating Portugal's underdeveloped investment market
will be the approval of a new commercial lease law. The current law provides
tenants with perpetual security of tenure without any open-market rent
reviews. The new law will provide for fixed-term contracts after which rents
can be renegotiated at market rates. The legislation could be approved
within the next few months - a promise that the authorities have been making
since 1987.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (10): Signs that investment will
improve - Bargain hunters can find good quality office space at some of the
lowest prices in Europe / Austria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vienna property market is not out of the doldrums yet, but there are
signs that rental prices may have reached bottom and that investment is
destined to pick up because the scarcity of new developments could lead to
under-supply of office space within a couple of years.
For the time being however, bargain hunters can find good quality office
space at some of the lowest prices in Europe ranging from Sch280 a sq m for
top development in prime sites, to Sch120-Sch160 a sq m elsewhere.
Rents declined sharply after almost doubling between 1987 and 1992 during a
speculative boom encouraged by the prospect - now abandoned - of a joint
world expo with Budapest in 1995. Last year alone, prime rents fell by about
11 per cent. As a result, office space in Vienna is now cheaper than in
Prague or Budapest, which goes to explain why so many companies are looking
to Vienna again as a location for their central and eastern European
headquarters.
'There are many constraints on the market, but things are improving, and
we're seeing an increasing number of international companies setting up
here,' says Mr Alan Vincent from real estate consultants Richard Ellis.
Companies that have chosen Vienna as a regional base include McDonald's,
IBM, Hewlett Packard, Alcatel, American Express, Gillette,
Colgate-Palmolive, Pepsico and Nomura.
Vienna's offers a good supply of western standard office space at reasonable
rents, it has efficient telecommunications, a good transport infrastructure,
a clean and attractive environment, and a high quality of life, says Mr
Vincent.
As Budapest, Prague and Warsaw develop, there may be less incentive to go to
Vienna as more companies may chose to base themselves directly in those
cities. But 'many western companies have already been disillusioned by the
slow pace of improvement of their transport, infrastructure and
telecommunications, as well as the generally poor environment,' a Richard
Ellis report argues.
Vienna, it says, is likely to remain a regional centre for Austria, Hungary,
and the Czech and Slovak republics for the medium term.
Which should be good news for investors and developers who found Vienna a
difficult market to enter. 'Owner occupation in Vienna stands at around 80
per cent with the market dominated by banks and insurance companies, which
in turn own property development and construction companies,' says a report
by John Lang Wootton.
'People here tend to hold on to their property, and that makes for a very
illiquid market,' says Mr Vincent.
The residential market also continues to suffer from rent and tenancy
controls that give almost unlimited security of tenure to occupiers. Agents
say recently-approved legislation has made matters worse by further
strengthening protection for tenants. 'Landlords have no incentive to
maintain their property in Vienna, and this could lead to some serious
degradation as a result of neglect in a few years' time,' says one agent.
Meanwhile several projects have recently been completed or will be completed
shortly, with a few large developments in the pipeline. Supply has exceeded
demand since 1991, leading to a vacancy rate of about 5 per cent today,
although agents say this is not high by international comparison. With
demand for office space averaging about 130,000 sq m a year, supply peaked
at 290,00 sq m in 1993 and is expected to fall to 150,000 sq m this year,
and 80,000 sq m in 1995.
In and near the city centre there are several important developments ranging
in size from a 7,000 sq m office building recently completed by Groupe
Pierre 1er of France, to a planned 80,000 sq m of offices, apartments and
shops at Wien Mitte in a project originally led by Sweden's SPP. LET, but
taken over by Bank Austria and domestic partners after SPP. LET sold out.
Further out from the centre, developments range from the huge Donau-City
project with a planned 470,000 sq m of offices, apartments, shops, and a big
hotel, in the north-east of the city, to the 37,000 sq m Concorde Business
Park, Vienna's only purpose-built business park, on the road to the airport.
Four office developments, two of which have already been completed and let,
totalling 160,000 sq m are planned along Lasallestrasse, on the main
north-east axis out of Vienna; and Business Park Vienna, a 60,000 sq m
development with offices and a hotel in the south of the city.
The Donau-City project dwarfs all others by its size and its ambition to
become Vienna's second city centre. The first phase of construction
representing about 40 per cent of the total development including all basic
infrastructure and some 70,000 sq m of residential, office and commercial
space is expected to be completed in 1997. The rest of the development will
be completed at a more leisurely pace 'depending on market demand' an
official said.
Outside Vienna, the market is small, with some activity in Graz and Linz,
although local restrictions - especially in Salzburg and in the Tyrol - make
it very difficult for foreign investors.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (11): Economic downturn catches
up - Brussels is suffering from the same problems that have afflicted other
European markets / Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently, the resilience of the Brussels property market has made it
the envy of many of its recession-hit neighbours.
The European Union, which together with the Belgian government occupies some
60 per cent of Brussels' offices, appeared to insulate the Brussels market
from the effects of the European economic downturn.
No longer. Brussels is now suffering from the same problems of reduced
demand and rising vacancy rates that have afflicted other European markets.
The cost of renting space declined last year, marking the end of a period of
continuous rental growth since 1980.
The extent of this downturn took some observers by surprise. 'We had hoped
that Brussels would not be hit too much because of the EU's presence,' says
Mr Philippe Winssinger of DTZ Winssinger, property advisers. 'In fact, the
recession has been worse than we anticipated as a result of a lot of
domestic companies cutting back on their need for space and multinationals
reducing the size of their Brussels operation.'
Office vacancy rates stand at about 8 per cent, compared with a low of about
3 per cent in 1989. On the face of it, demand for office space remained at a
high level, with about 300,000 sq m being let or sold to occupiers. However,
a large proportion of that was accounted for by a single deal, namely
Belgacom's acquisition of the 110,000 sq m Tour Pleiad. In addition, the EU
accounted for about 15 per cent of the total take-up.
Many of the remaining occupiers have shed staff and reduced their
requirements for space. 'It is now far more common for demand for space to
originate from groups looking to move to smaller offices than those
contemplating an increase in their occupation,' says Richard Ellis,
chartered surveyors.
There are marked variations in the state of the letting market, according to
the location, quality and age of building.
The brunt of the increase in vacancy rates has affected the city centre and
Leopold district (the main EU and financial area), where rents have fallen
by 15-20 per cent.
By contrast, the office market in the periphery of Brussels has been more
stable. It has benefited from companies leaving the centre of Brussels to
escape traffic congestion and increased local taxes. A new office tax
introduced in Brussels in 1989 increased the tax burden on office occupiers
by about 20 per cent, which is enough to offset the benefits of lower rents.
A widening gap is also opening up between new and old offices, where the
rental differential is some 10-15 per cent. The decline in rents is likely
to stop in the near future in new buildings because they will be taken up in
preference to older buildings, in the view of Mr Michel Pilette of Jones
Lang Wootton. He estimates that three quarters of the new space, which
currently accounts for a third of the available stock, will be let by the
end of the year.
In older buildings, however, rents are likely to continue to decline,
particularly as investors are proving reluctant to spend money on
refurbishment.
Some factors, however, encourage confidence that the letting market will
revive. Although EU budgets are currently constrained, its requirement for
offices is likely to grow as it embraces new members.
Moreover, there is little new property coming onto the market. The current
speculative development programme will add just 137,000 sq m of space - less
than 2 per cent - to the total office stock, according to Richard Ellis. The
city's tight planning controls will ensure that the future supply of new
stock is constrained.
Despite the current travails of the letting market, there has been a marked
improvement in the investment market. This was stimulated by the decline in
interest rates, which pushed the cost of money below property yields in many
cases.
Total investment was close to a record of BFr28-30bn last year, compared
with BFr15-18bn in the previous year. Private Belgian investors have been
important players in the market, through securitisation, which offers tax
advantages. Two such Belgian Real Estate Certificates were sold last year:
one for 37,000 sq m in the Green Belt for BFr5.3bn on a yield of 7.5 per
cent and one in the Avenue Marcel Thiry for 10,000 sq m of offices for
BFr1.06bn, on a yield of 7.6 per cent.
At present, investors remain cautious as they confine their interest to
high-quality buildings which are less than 15 years old, with good leases.
But the return of investors to the market is likely to gather momentum,
believes Mr Winssinger. 'We are at a stage where the UK was a year ago, with
high yields, low rents and low cost of money. A year ago, there was a lot of
product but limited buyers. Now that has reversed,' he says.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (9): More resilient than most -
There was a marked pick-up in demand for good quality buildings in the
second half of 1993, after two sluggish years / The Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession has dealt lightly with the Dutch property market. While it has
not escaped entirely from rising vacancy rates, stagnating rents and
sluggish investment markets, it has remained more stable than most of its
continental European counterparts.
This resilience can, in part, be attributed to the decentralised structure
of the Dutch property market. Dutch businesses are scattered throughout the
principle Netherlands cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague and Utrecht.
As a result, rents are rarely driven up by the pressure of demand, and
therefore Dutch property rental values tend to be lower and more stable that
other European cities.
Another factor influencing the stability of the market is the dominant role
played by institutions. This means that property is usually funded with
equity, rather than bank finance.
As a result, there is little pressure on property owners to sell property
during the trough of a cycle. 'In a downturn, there is the appearance of a
stable market,' says Mr Glen Cowan of Jones Lang Wootton, property advisers.
'There is no distressed selling.'
Many property owners are hoping that the downturn is over as far as the
investment market is concerned. There was a marked pick-up in demand for
good quality buildings in the second half of 1993, after two sluggish years.
The upturn was particularly pronounced in the retail sector, which accounted
for almost 60 per cent of the Fl2.2bn invested in property last year.
As interest rates fell, the high initial yields available on property have
begun to look more attractive.
The improvement in the investment market has not embraced poorer-quality
buildings, for which yields have increased by about one percentage point.
However, fully let, well-located buildings in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the
Hague and Utrecht are in demand; yields have dropped by between a quarter
and a half of a percentage point.
In the largest single office investment deal ever done in Amsterdam, MBO,
development arm of Internationale Nederlanden Group, sold its 34,000 sq m
Atrium building in Amsterdam South to Zurich Life Insurance on a yield of
under 6.5 per cent.
The fortunes of the occupational market are generally less encouraging,
although they vary markedly from sector to sector.
The retail market has been relatively robust in 1993, with vacancy rates of
just 1-2 per cent. Some prime units which were let between 1989 and 1992 may
now be slightly over-rented as a result of a slight decline in consumer
spending, according to Richard Ellis. But shopping centres with strong
anchor tenants and individual secondary retail units are continuing to
experience some rental growth.
The strength of the retail property market has prompted developers to draw
up plans for a significant number of new shopping centres. These proposals
add about 300,000 sq m of retail space to the pipeline, bringing the
projected development total to about 1m sq m.
In the industrial sector, the economic downturn resulted in a 15 per cent
drop in institutional demand, according to DTZ. Despite this, small modern
industrial units are in short supply; most of the surplus space is in
relatively large, industrial complexes. Overall, rents remained stable last
year.
In the office market there is, on the face of it, little cause for concern.
Last year, demand for offices rose sharply to a record 1.37m sq m across the
Netherlands, according to DTZ Zadelhoff.
In part, this was because government agencies agreed to let 530,000 sq m of
space, which partly resulted from a government decision to relocate many of
the judicial authorities. Most parts of the country registered higher demand
in 1993, but Amsterdam proved to be the most popular office location with
take-up reaching some 200,000 sq m.
However, these strong take-up figures mask the fact that tenants are
relinquishing space when they move into new buildings. With hardly any net
absorption of office space, the availability of space rose by 8 per cent to
stand at 2.7m sq m. Agents expect vacancy rates to remain high this year, as
companies announce cut-backs in staffing levels.
As a result there has been pressure on rents. Rents on space in some of the
most expensive offices in southern Amsterdam have fallen by 5-10 per cent.
Elsewhere, the pressure from rising vacancy rates has forced landlords to
make larger concessions in the form of rent-free periods and other
incentives. Although the supply of new space coming on the market has
fallen, agents do not expect rents to grow in real terms this year. Hopes
are pinned on an improvement in the economy, coupled with a reduction in
available space, which could result in a pick-up in rental growth next year.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (8): Rome and Milan are poles
apart - With 1m sq m taken by government and other public sector occupants,
the capital's property market is less sensitive to recession / Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few were surprised when leading Italian bankers were arrested last month,
and real estate operations became the subject of an investigation by the
mani pulite (clean hands) magistrates' team. The surprise was that the
magistrates took so long in making the connection. Politics and property
find their nexus in banks, particularly where top bankers are politicians'
appointees.
The arrests took place at a difficult time for the property sector, already
hard-pressed by the effects of recession. Bricks and mortar had enjoyed a
solid reputation in Italy as zero-risk investment, but this is changing.
'Banks are having to decide how to deal with shaky construction companies.
They now seem more prudent and readier to turn off the cash tap. There have
not yet been clamorous cases of company failure, but the problem is growing
and banks are finding themselves with unwanted property portfolios,' says a
manager with a leading Rome real estate agency.
Property values divide borrowers and lenders, the sharp drop in prices since
the beginning of the 1990s lying behind the increasing concern about loans
secured against real estate collateral. Prices of office accommodation have
fallen by as much as 50 per cent in the capital, albeit weakening less in
the best locations.
This is reflected in rents which are now significantly lower in money terms
than two years ago. 'They have declined from a maximum of L750,000 to
L650,000 a sq m a year for good quality offices in prime locations in the
historic centre,' says Mr Roberto Trella, managing director of Richard Ellis
SpA, the British company's Italian subsidiary.
Strict planning constraints mean that supply is virtually static in Rome's
centre. Vacancy rates of around 5 per cent are half those recorded in the
outskirts.
Ministries and public bodies are important in Rome's market. This may
explain the generally low standard of properties. 'Most of recent
construction has been speculative. Buildings are not highly specified and
are generally not satisfactory for international users,' says Mr Trella.
With about 1m sq m of the 6m sq m total within Rome's GRA ring road taken by
government and other public sector occupants, the capital's property market
is less sensitive to the recession than elsewhere.
Indeed, the figures show that recession and other adverse factors have
bitten deeper in Milan, the other pole in what is essentially a bi-polar
Italian market. 'Milan's office stock amounts to about 8.5m sq m. Vacancy
rates are now between 8 and 10 per cent in the centre and between 20 and 25
per cent in the outskirts,' says Mr Trella.
Milan's property bubble, in which rents and capital values rose by 300 per
cent between 1985 and 1990, burst before the more gentle deflation started
in the capital. The peak was reached at the end of 1990, anticipating the
recession's onset, and arriving more than two years before the mani pulite
magistrates made their first public moves. Mr Trella says: 'Annual rents for
prime city centre accommodation are now below L550,000 a sq m, against
L750,000 three years ago.'
Nevertheless, strict planning policies, favouring residential use and
preventing the construction of new buildings in Milan's centre, give a firm
base to the property market. And as the country's business capital, with its
stock market, leading domestic financial institutions and the head offices
of leading industrial companies, Milan is the natural location choice for
foreign companies setting foot in Italy.
At the centre of the country's principal manufacturing areas, Milan is also
close to the country's important trading partners, and enjoys good transport
connections to the outside. And unlike Rome, which suffers from very poor
services, Milan has reasonable public transport. With these positive
features, it is difficult to envisage the demand for business accommodation
shifting from Milan to other Italian cities.
'Yet Milan does nothing to promote itself,' remarks Mr Paul Bacon, partner
at Healey  Baker's Milan office. Whereas other big business centres
actively seek to attract newcomers, the Lombardy capital does not push
itself.
In addition to its innately strong position, perhaps another reason is the
shortage of good property. 'There is a lack of quality in the market. Even
in the centre, most property is of poor quality. Inadequate lifts are
normal, and almost two thirds of buildings do not have air conditioning
systems,' says Mr Bacon.
He considers, however, that opportunities exist for foreign investors.
'Companies have been downsizing during the recession, and searching for cost
saving by reducing office requirements and relocating from the centre to the
outskirts. This has created investment opportunities.'
'Prices have dropped by between 30 and 35 per cent from their peaks, and
Milan is now looking cheap compared to other cities,' observes Mr Bacon,
adding that yields have risen from 5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. This is an
attractive factor for north European investors seeking income flow.
'Italian investors tend to buy for capital growth. Discouraged by political
uncertainty and falling prices, they have been absent from the market since
the end of 1992.' Mr Bacon expects that the property markets in Rome and
Milan will become more like those in other leading European cities, with a
greater presence of international investors. He also believes that Italian
institutions will align themselves with international practices.
'We are likely to see change in three areas. First, legislation will lead to
the creation of property funds. Second, Italian insurance companies will
give greater emphasis to yields. Third, Italian banks will become more
aggressive, and the average loan ratio will increase from 50 to 70 per
cent,' predicts Mr Bacon.
And when will the market turn up? Political and economic factors will
decide. The uncertainty that clouds Italian politics will probably not be
cleared by the parliamentary elections at the end of March, and an upturn in
the economy does not seem imminent. Few would wager that the bottom has been
reached in the property market.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (7): Back to life after
near-death experience - Things are picking up as institutional investors
start to buy properties again / Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment property scene in Ireland is coming back to life after a
prolonged near-death experience in 1993.
Britain's withdrawal from the ERM in September 1992, and the devaluation of
the Irish punt which inevitably followed - despite Dublin's best efforts to
stave it off - in January last year, gave a sharp shock to the market which
was already heading for the doldrums because of the international recession.
As interest rates soared on cash deposits, property looked less and less
attractive. Now, however, rates have plummeted and stabilised. A reasonable
commercial investment in Dublin should see a return of around 10 per cent,
and so things are picking up as institutional investors start to buy
properties again.
In the domestic sector, the signs of revival which estate agents have been
predicting for a year are at last peeping through. However, the hottest
potato in this sector at present is the lowering of the value threshold at
which private residences become liable for residential property tax. In the
January budget, the threshold of liability for this tax, to be paid
annually, fell from a house value of Pounds 91,000 to Pounds 75,000.
There is less contention in the recovering commercial sector. Commercial
property investments appear promising and could rise by 10 per cent over the
next six months, according to Property Outlook, produced by the agency
Hamilton Osborne King. HOK, reflecting that 60 per cent of the Pounds 60m of
prime investment properties which changed hands in 1993 were sold in the
last three months of the year, saw this as an indication that momentum was
gathering in this area.
Quality retail space is being sought eagerly. Mr Bill Phelan, principal in
leading property consultant The Phelan Partnership, says a number of British
retailers are 'desperate' to find space in Grafton Street, Dublin's
up-market shopping precinct and the associated pedestrianised area that
leads from Trinity College up to the business end of Dublin around the
charming park called St Stephen's Green.
Rents there have been around Pounds 140-Pounds 150 a sq ft, but Gunne, one
of the Republic's big four estate agencies, reported recently that it had
let 32 Grafton Street on a 35-year lease at a rate of Pounds 165 a sq ft,
indicating the clear supremacy of this location over other prime shopping
streets such as Henry Street and Mary Street, a few minutes' walk away on
the north side of the River Liffey.
Mr Phelan is not overly impressed by glossy new office developments such as
George's Quay on the reclaimed stretch of quayside by the River Liffey,
opposite the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) complex. 'They
are, and always will be, secondary locations,' he says.
Mr Des Lennon is a partner at Jones Lang Wootton, which employs 65 people in
Dublin, its only Irish office. He agrees that, after the dire straits of
1992-1993, the main problem the Irish market has to handle now is a lack of
good property for the cash-rich investor.
However, about 1.4m sq ft of vacant space indicates that the office market
is depressed. The figure represents about 11 per cent of the entire space
available in Dublin and is a historically high figure, says Mr Lennon.
'Three or four years ago, the comparable figure would have been 5 per cent.
Still, it is not bad in the European context when you consider London had a
vacancy rate of 20 per cent last year.'
Much of the recent development of property in older parts of Dublin, and
some selected sites in other cities, was undertaken to take advantage of tax
incentives introduced in the late 1980s with Section 23 of the Finance Act.
These are for residential buildings in so-called Urban Renewal Development
Areas and include: no property taxes (rates) for 10 years; a double rent
allowance for landlords; and a capital allowance, whereby an investor or
occupier can offset the entire purchase of a building against profits.
These inducements were originally due to expire in February 1993 but there
was so much activity that the government extended the deadline several
times. For special exceptions such as the Customs House area, down-river
from O'Connell Bridge, the cut-off is not until 1997. Since 1988, when this
round of Section 23 tax breaks was introduced, Pounds 966m of private sector
investment has been generated by the urban renewal schemes.
A host of developers is building inner city apartments in Dublin, and these
have been selling rapidly. Temple Bar, only a few minutes' walk from Grafton
Street, has seen much activity in the 1990s and is earmarked for Pounds 334m
in further spending from the government and European Union funds.
Retail is strong in the Republic's secondary cities, with Longford town,
Galway and Cork all seeing new supermarkets and shopping complexes opening
or under construction. Cruises Street, in the heart of Limerick, has been a
big success as a regeneration project, with a quaint 'olde' look and a
number of strong retailers.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (6): Business mood has settled
down - Supply is easing into a rough balance with demand. The new buzzword
is 'equilibrium' / Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budapest property analysts, when they reach for a description of the local
market for office space, have to work their tongues around an unfamiliar
word: 'equilibrium.'
The international companies which crammed into hastily converted apartments
at the start of the decade are now generally installed, more or less
contentedly, in modern offices. The business mood, after swinging first to
euphoria and then to disappointment, has settled down  - and with it the
take-up for new rental space, steady at about 45,000 sq m a year.
Development, too, has come through its own, lagging, cycle. Budapest had a
dearth of office stock until 1991. 'There was not a single good building
since the second world war. Look around: they are all terrible,' says Mr
Christopher Bennett, head of Price Waterhouse's property department in
Budapest.
Then came a surplus as projects begun in the glory days belatedly reached
the end of the development pipeline. But now supply is easing into rough
balance with demand. Debenham Thorpe Zadelhoff, the property advisers,
estimates that 126,000 sq m of space is under construction or likely to be
built over the next three years.
Rents for prime space reflect this balance: after leaping to DM55 a sq m at
the start of 1992, rates have stabilised at around DM45-DM50. Forecasts for
rates in 1994 range from flat to a slight firming in the second half of the
year.
Budapest's relative sobriety owes less, however, to clear thinking on the
part of developers and more to the practical difficulties in obtaining
appropriate sites and getting projects off the ground.
Prices for sites have been sticky, rather than stable, because their
Hungarian owners often have a rather rigid view of value. Wide divergence
between asking and offer prices remains common. Mr Bennett knows of one
building where the asking price is three times the Price Waterhouse
valuation.
Nor will equilibrium necessarily endure. Domestic companies only occupy a
tenth of Budapest's office area and their financial recovery would overwhelm
existing provision. Hungary's capital is the largest city between Germany
and the former Soviet Union with 2m inhabitants but has the office stock -
225,000 sq m - of a Bristol.
Imperfect and immature it may be, but Budapest's property market at least
functions. Quality and location, for example, now have an impact on rents
which used to be more or less standard across the city. Maculan's
development on Vaci road, leading north out of Budapest, is letting at a
discount - at about DM35 a sq m.
An investment market is coming into existence. Long-term funds are beginning
to buy developments off the banks, mainly Austrian, which financed them. The
process has been slow and yields remain high at about 13-14 per cent. 'They
(the investors) are all sheep and it is very difficult to get the first
sheep into the dip,' says Mr Bennett. But three important transactions took
place in 1993 and Price Waterhouse forecasts a further 10 this year.
Convergence of yields with west European levels offers the promise of a
one-off capital gain for early buyers.
The impending sale of the East-West Centre, Budapest's most successful
development, will set a benchmark. The property, developed by Skanska of
Sweden, is on the market at DM108m, implying a yield of about 11 per cent,
and expected to go to a German or Dutch fund.
Geography enhances Budapest's attractions to a property investor. Budapest,
in contrast with Berlin and Warsaw, has a clear centre around Deak Square,
defined by the river and transport intersections. Analysts believe
properties in this prime area will always command firm rents and provide a
secure return for investors.
Fotex, Hungary's largest home-grown private business, has developed a
building at the foot of the residential Buda hills. But the most ambitious
project to shift Budapest's centre of gravity, the 1996 Expo, has failed
dismally to attract interest from developers.
While Budapest's market for offices is taking shape, that for retail and
distribution space remains disappointingly formless to observers. The
'berleti jog,' a unique Hungarian institution, something between an endless
lease and a rental agreement, stifles the retail market.
Western retailers have often gone into joint ventures with existing tenants
rather than buying them out, because a change in occupancy is cause for the
owner, usually the local authority, to raise the rent. Rents have in
practice remained low but the lack of clear rules about renegotiation makes
the value of a berleti jog very subjective.
Less easy to explain is the lack of warehouse space. As continuity of supply
becomes more important, so does depth of stock, and the availability of
modern, well-located warehouse space. But there is precious little.
Mr Durrant, blaming obstinate local authorities, says: 'It is impossible to
find a decent-sized concrete box anywhere around Budapest.' A customer for
an office, not a shed, might have made that comment five years ago. That is
the measure of Budapest's progress.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (5): Sharp differences between
regions - Research by a property consultant found that the main commercial
centres suffered a much more severe recession than the middle-ranking cities
/ Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Germany's worst recession since the second world war has caught up with the
country's highly regionalised commercial property market. Rents fell across
the board last year and there is a growing volume of empty space as building
projects commissioned before the downturn come onto the market.
According to Muller International Immobilien, a German commercial property
consultant, average rents for prime office space dropped from DM51 a sq m to
DM45 a sq m over 1993, a fall of about 12 per cent. The volume of unoccupied
property surged in Germany's 12 leading cities from 1.4m sq m in 1992 to
2.4m sq m in 1993; up more than 70 per cent.
The data conceal sharp regional differences. Muller found that Germany's
main commercial centres suffered a much more severe recession than the
middle-ranking cities. For example, the volume of space let in Cologne and
Hanover was at exactly the same level in 1993 as in 1992 while in Dresden
and Leipzig, coupled with Essen in the Ruhr area of northern Germany, there
was a sharp increase in volume of space rented out.
'These three cities all represent 'young office' markets at an early stage
of development,' Muller comments. In the east German cities, the market also
benefited from a high level of pent-up demand, although this was not enough
to stop a 17 per cent fall in rents in Leipzig.
The picture for the more highly developed office markets in Dusseldorf,
Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich was much worse. Rentals fell by 29 per cent in
Munich and 24 per cent in Berlin while the volume of space let fell by a
dismal 49 per cent.
Another negative factor was the surge in unoccupied space which in the 12
cities surveyed by Muller climbed from 1.4m sq m in 1992 to 2.4m sq m in
1993. Add in a slight increase in the volume of space under construction, to
5.2m sq m, and the volume of available space after pre-lettings and
owner-occupation rose to a record 6.7m sq m - 4 1/2 times the level of space
let last year.
In Frankfurt, which retained its position as Germany's leading office
property market in terms of rentals levels and volume of space let, the
volume of unoccupied space has surged in the past two years. Including
peripheral locations and offices under construction, the volume of
unoccupied space in Frankfurt stands at 1.3m sq m; five times the 250,000 sq
m let last year. Up until the 1991 building boom, unoccupied space had for
years averaged a modest 150,000 sq m.
Notwithstanding the space overhang, the future of the Frankfurt market is
far from bleak. The decision to site the future European Central Bank in
Frankfurt will consolidate the city's role as continental Europe's leading
financial centre. Independent of this decision, foreign banks have steadily
devoted greater resources to the German market.
It is the international flavour of the Frankfurt office market, with demand
dictated to a large extent by foreign financial institutions, which has
driven the fall in rentals in the city. Last year, the highest rent achieved
was DM75 a sq m, a long way from the near-DM100 a sq m levels of 1991-92.
When the world economy recovers it is to be expected that foreign
institutions will continue to upgrade their commitment to Finanzplatz
Germany - Germany as a financial centre - to Frankfurt's advantage.
In other cities, the property downturn was triggered more by the domestic
recession. Munich was the worst hit, reflecting the impact of the recession
on sectors such as electrical engineering, computer technology, aerospace
and vehicle manufacture, all strongly represented in the Bavarian capital.
Berlin has also suffered as a result of the recession, but the political
doubts hanging over the city's future - another negative for the office
property market - have to some extent been lifted by the German parliament's
reaffirmation that Berlin will become reunited Germany's capital by the end
of the decade.
With the German economy making at best a slow recovery in 1994-95 - and at
worst entering into the second stage of a 'double-dip' recession  - the
German office property market is set for further consolidation.
An underpinning of the market is, however, likely to come from international
investors looking for bargains and from the domestic open-ended property
funds, a form of investment vehicle which has proved highly popular with
individual investors over the past year.
According to Mr Oscar Kienzle, head of Knight Frank  Rutley's German
operations, there is DM10bn invested in the funds, pent-up demand equivalent
to half a year's normal purchasing activity. This money must, by law, be
invested in property, and is likely to provide healthy liquidity support for
the German market.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (4): Residential sector leads -
Commercial property is generally still in the doldrums although there are
some exceptions / France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the French finance ministry fled from its opulent offices in the Louvre
Museum in central Paris to its glacial new headquarters at Bercy, it also
abandoned a 19th century office building on a prime site on nearby rue
Saint-Honore which was immediately earmarked for sale.
Four years later, the building is still empty. The government has decided to
leave it vacant until the Paris property market picks up rather than risk
selling it now at a depressed price and thereby adding to the existing
pressures on commercial property prices in the city centre.
The government's decision might have been different had the building been
suitable for residential use. Commercial property is still in the doldrums
in France, but there have in recent months been signs of recovery in the
residential sphere. The French property business is now anxiously waiting to
see whether the pick-up in the residential market will spread to the
commercial sector, thereby marking the end of three gruelling years of
recession.
Almost every area of the French economy has been bruised by recession over
the past year, yet few sectors have been as badly affected as property. The
market peaked in 1990 when prices soared and the supply of new buildings,
particularly office space in the Golden Triangle and La Defense districts in
Paris and the Part-Dieu area of Lyon, increased dramatically.
But the market collapsed when the economy came under pressure in the early
1990s. The high rate of French real interest rates, which have for the past
few years been among the steepest in Europe, prompted companies to cut back
on investment and consumers to save, rather than spend, their money -
thereby depressing the demand for commercial and residential property alike.
The demand problem was aggravated in both sectors by the stream of new
developments coming on to the market. By the beginning of 1993, when France
moved into technical recession for the first time since the Gulf war, the
commercial market was further depressed by weak confidence and the
escalating rate of business failures. The rise in joblessness had a similar
effect on the residential sector.
Rentals and purchase prices tumbled in both sectors: although the pressure
was most acute in the commercial districts of Paris and Lyon that had fared
best during the boom years. A recent survey by Jones Lang Wootton estimated
that average annual rentals for prime office space in the Golden Triangle
had fallen from FFr4,500 a square metre in the final quarter of 1990 to
FFr3,500 by the end of 1993. In La Defense, prime rentals declined from
FFr3,100 to FFr2,050 over the same period. In Part-Dieu they fell from
FFr950 to FFr850.
However the French property scene has been spared the same rash of
receiverships which were such a painful feature of the US and UK industries
in the early 1990s. This is because of the defensive structure of the
market, whereby the big banks and insurance groups that dominate property
ownership, step in to support vulnerable companies and to prevent them from
collapsing and thus creating a vicious cycle of over-supply and declining
prices.
The French recession is now over, or so Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister,
is anxiously attempting to assure the electorate.
The residential sector seems to be recovering first. Mr Andre Levy-Lang,
chairman of Paribas, recently said that the strains were easing in that
sector. Residential property prices are slowly starting to strengthen.
By contrast, commercial property is still generally depressed. There are
some exceptions, such as the retail sector which has perked up particularly
in the fashion sphere. The latest analysis of the French market by Knight
Frank  Rutley also detected an increase in activity in the office letting
sector as tenants have taken advantage of low rentals. But it also cautioned
that this pick-up had little impact on the supply situation as most tenants
had simply moved from one property to another of the same size.
Investment activity is still sluggish, according to Jones Lang Wootton, with
the big banks and insurers still refusing to adjust the book valuations of
their property holdings to reflect the reduced values of the mid-1990s.
However, it noted that some institutions were making more realistic
revaluations.
But in the meantime, the government does not seem to have enough confidence
to reopen and redevelop the old finance ministry building on rue
Saint-Honore - however optimistic Mr Balladur purports to be.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (3): Source of charm and
frustration - Foreign investors have to grapple with an antiquated telephone
network, an inordinate amount of red tape, uncertain property claims, and a
scarcity of good quality office space and accommodation / Czech Republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prague, with its old historic centre practically untouched by modern
developers, may be one of the best preserved capitals of the former
communist bloc.
But what gives the Czech capital much of its charm can also be the source of
much frustration for foreign investors who have to grapple with an
antiquated and overloaded telephone network, an inordinate amount of red
tape, uncertain property claims, and a scarcity of good quality office space
and accommodation, not to mention appalling levels of pollution.
After two years of slow progress following the 1989 'velvet revolution' that
overthrew the communist regime, the property market took off in 1992 with
demand exceeding supply by 2 1/2 times and causing prices to rocket.
A two-tier market developed, with speculative developments - mostly
refurbishments - aimed at extracting the maximum rents from foreigners, on
the one hand, and a Czech market with very low prices that had been fixed
during the communist period with no reference to market values, on the
other.
Strict planning and building constraints, combined with strong tenancy
rights and rent controls, exacerbated the shortage of office space, and
contributed to inflated prices that have made Prague more expensive than
Vienna, Milan or Brussels.
'In 1992, about 30 per cent of property coming on the market was reasonably
priced, but the rest was well over-priced. The market got carried away with
people selling at German prices,' says Mr Robert Neale of property
consultants Healey  Baker.
Prices peaked at about DM65 for offices in prime site properties at the end
of 1992, but have fallen since to DM55-DM60 for the best locations and to
about DM50 elsewhere.
'In the early days there was a huge demand, but people got frightened off by
the high prices. Now the demand has been scaled down because the economy
will not grow as quickly as originally thought,' says Mr Alan Vincent from
consultants Richard Ellis. He believes prices will fall further as companies
seek simpler but more functional accommodation.
Price was not the only deterrent for companies looking for a central
European location. The bulk of the property on offer has been
refurbishments, and these tend to lack the flexibility and facilities
available in new accommodation. Many were of poor quality.
Richard Ellis calculate that roughly 70 per cent of the 12,000 sq m of
office space that came on the market in 1992 was refurbished property.
Refurbished accommodation represents 40 per cent of some 43,000 sq m of
office space supplied in 1993 and a forecast 40,500 sq m of new office space
expected this year.
'Most of those refurbishments should have been gutted out. Unfortunately
many people did superficial refurbishments, painting over the cracks. The
market has always been starved of quality space, and to some extent it still
is,' says Mr Neal.
Only a few developments offer high quality. The International Business
Centre (IBC), a joint development by France's Caisse des Depots and
Compagnie Generale de Batiment et de Construction, is regarded as offering
the best accommodation at the moment. The 24,000 sq m development was
completed last year and more than 70 per cent has been let, say Healey 
Baker. Tenants include Societe Generale, Johnson  Johnson, and mostly
companies with a foreign interest. The development is adjacent to the Atrium
Hotel and a large conference centre, and while it is slightly off the city
centre, it is close to the metro line and the north-south motorway.
The Charles Bridge Centre developed by Fingroup offers more than 3,000 sq m
of mixed-use space for offices, suites, shops and restaurants. It is a small
development but it has a unique location and views across Charles Bridge and
the river. The development, consisting of three fully-refurbished historical
buildings overlooking the Vltava river, is due to be completed in March.
Office space has been let at DM52 a sq m, mostly to foreign companies.
There are several other small developments under construction, or planned,
around the city centre including some refurbished palaces. The biggest
project in the centre is on Na Prikope, a mainly pedestrian street, where
the Caisse des Depots has bought a site for which it hopes to win planning
permission to build 10,000 sq m of shops and 20,000 sq m of offices. This is
the only large prime site development in the pipeline.
Because of planning restrictions and lack of financing, Prague missed out on
the larger developments seen elsewhere in post-communist eastern Europe. But
this may not be such a bad thing in the long term, says Mr Neale.
'Developers are limited especially in the centre, but this should have a
positive effect on rents and yields.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (2): Investors have returned in
strength - In some parts of the market, a gradual recovery of business
confidence is already resulting in increased take-up / Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of severe recession, the UK property market is in the
throes of a spectacular recovery. Investors have returned to the property
market in strength, creating one of the most buoyant market for good quality
property since the 1970s.
The resurgence of the UK property market can be attributed to two factors:
the strength of the government bond market, and the anticipation of a
recovery in rental values.
The most powerful of these stimuli was the sharp fall in bond yields in
1993, when long gilt yields fell from 8.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent. As
equity and bond yields plummeted, the relatively high yields available on
property became increasingly attractive to investors.
More money became available for property from several sources. Institutions
increased their allocations to the sector, property companies earmarked new
funds for investment from the Pounds 2.39bn they raised from rights issues
and foreign investors increased their investment in UK property from Pounds
1.3bn in 1992 to nearly Pounds 2.2bn in 1993.
The weight of demand for property sharply drove down property yields. On
average, they fell by 0.8 per cent to 8.2 per cent in the second half of
1993, which is the largest fall over any six-month period since 1977,
according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors.
The uplift has benefited all sectors of the market, but has been
particularly marked in the retail sector, where yields on some high street
shops and retail warehouse parks have fallen to record lows.
The London office market, which was for several years shunned by investors,
has also staged a remarkable recovery. It registered a record annual decline
in yields last year, when they fell by 1.8 percentage points to 8.3 per
cent.
Property yields are expected to continue to move downwards, in the view of
UBS, the brokers. It cites the rapid fall of gilt yields, which has outpaced
the fall in property yields; the weight of money available for investment
and the likely resumption of rental growth as reasons for expecting average
yields to fall throughout 1994, even if gilt yields rise significantly
during this period.
So far, the occupational market has made a relatively small contribution to
the turnaround in the performance of the property sector. Although the fall
in rental values slowed in the final quarter of 1993, rents continued to
decline in December, at a rate varying from 2 per cent in the rental market
to 10 per cent in the office market, according to the Investment Property
Databank, a research group.
However, the health of the occupational market is improving, particularly in
cities outside London, which suffered less severely from the recession than
London and are not burdened with such a large oversupply of space.
In some parts of the market, a gradual recovery of business confidence is
already resulting in increased take-up. An upturn in tenant demand last year
pushed the availability of offices in central London down by more than a
fifth to stand at 14 per cent of the total stock, according to DTZ Debenham
Thorpe.
Savills, a firm of property advisers, believes that rents on top quality
London offices are poised for a revival. Over the next three years, it
predicts a 15 per cent annual increase in rates for top-grade space in the
City of London to an average of Pounds 46 per square foot. In the West End,
it predicts a 12 per cent annual rise to an average of Pounds 51 per sq ft.
The retail sector is already showing signs of an upturn, despite the patchy
nature of the recovery in the retail sector. The balance between supply and
demand has improved as a result of a modest improvement in take-up, together
with a decline in development activity which has fallen since reaching a
peak in 1990.
These factors have resulted in a fall in shopping centre vacancy rates from
33 per cent to 26 per cent over the past year.
The industrial property sector is also beginning to improve, having
registered the first fall in available floorspace since May 1989. King
Sturge, a firm of chartered surveyors, believes that the amount of available
industrial space dropped by 1 per cent to 180.5m sq ft in the last four
months of 1993.
A revival in the occupational market will help the recovery of the
investment market become more broadly-based.
So far, the type of property being sought by investors has been
predominantly high quality, institutional-grade property, with secure
incomes paid by financially-strong tenants. But as concern about tenant
bankruptcies diminishes, investors are placing less emphasis on security and
more on the potential for rental growth.
The extent of the revival of the property market will also depend on the
attitude of the banks, which are largely responsible for financing
second-tier properties which do not play a part in institutional portfolios.
As the rental market improves and the banks' willingness to lend to the
sector increases, the improvement in property values will spread more widely
throughout the market.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (1): Investors are tempted back
 -Buyers are seeking opportunities as the market sinks towards the bottom of
the property cycle / Introduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Europe struggles to emerge from recession, most of its property markets
remain deeply depressed. However, some investors are beginning to trawl the
markets for bargains, in the belief that prices are close to reaching the
bottom of their cycle.
So far, contra-cyclical investment activity has been limited. The exception
has been the UK investment market which attracted Pounds 2.2bn of overseas
money last year, as it staged a strong recovery.
However falling interest rates across Europe, coupled with relatively high
yields from property compared with other investments, are beginning to tempt
contra-cyclical investors back into the market. Paris, Madrid, Milan and
Lisbon are some of the continental European cities being scrutinised most
carefully.
Investors believe that if they get their timing right, they may buy near the
bottom of one of the deepest troughs of any post-war property cycle. 'As
markets move to the bottom of their cycle, there will be clear opportunities
during the year, ahead of an economic upswing, to do business at extremely
attractive prices,' says Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors.
Average capital values of prime offices in Europe's 14 largest property
markets have fallen by a third from their peak in March 1991, according to
Jones Lang Wootton. They are now at their lowest levels in real terms since
1986.
Some common themes run through many of Europe's property markets. The strong
economic upturn in the latter part of the 1980s resulted in increased
construction of new buildings, which came on stream at a time when the
recession had eroded tenant demand. As a result, vacancy rates have risen,
rents have fallen and investment yields have come under pressure.
The difficult economic conditions which have undermined occupational demand
in the past couple of years are generally expected to ease somewhat in 1994
 -although economic growth is expected, at best, to be limited. Moreover,
most established office markets now have a limited supply of new buildings
in the pipeline, which should help supply and demand come closer to
equilibrium.
But despite the similarities of the influences affecting Europe's markets,
there are marked differences in the structure and state of different
markets. They are influenced by their legal systems, planning laws, tax
regimes, bank lending policies, and accessibility to foreign investment, as
well as their stage of the economic cycle.
The greatest contrasts are those between the established markets of western
Europe and the fledgling markets of central and eastern Europe, which
continue to be hampered by legal and financial difficulties.
In Poland, there are problems with land title and financing continues to
restrict the number of new developments - except in the hotel sector, where
there is a surfeit of rooms at the top end of the market.
In the Czech Republic, all the large projects planned for central Prague
have collapsed, thanks to ownership problems, planning obstacles, financing
difficulties and the cautious approach adopted by potential occupiers.
In Hungary, many of Budapest's proposed office schemes have been postponed
or cancelled as a result of difficulties in raising finance. Investment
activity is largely limited to development projects or acquisitions by
owner-occupiers.
In Russia, last December's new constitution has strengthened private
property rights. But investment has been inhibited by red tape and political
instability.
Europe's more established property markets also present obstacles for
investors seeking bargains. In many of continental Europe's largest markets,
property values have not fallen as freely as in the UK.
In Belgium, the presence of the EU helps to stabilise the Brussels office
market, although the recession has pushed up vacancy rates. In the second
half of 1993, the fall in long-term interest rates stimulated investment
and, in particular, the market for securitised property.
In the Netherlands, the decentralised structure of the property market,
coupled with the dominant role played by institutions, has ensured that the
market remains more resilient than most.
In Paris, the investment market is still sluggish, as big banks and insurers
refuse to adjust the book valuations of their property in line with the
decline in the market.
In Germany, the investment market has remained remarkably robust, in spite
of economic difficulties. Strong demand from investors, led by the
open-ended property funds which have benefited from a large inflow of money,
ensured that yields stabilised in 1993 and in some cases improved.
In Spain, the recession which emerged midway through 1992 drove rents down
by as much as 40 per cent in some buildings. The sharp falls in values have
encouraged some interest from international investors anticipating recovery.
In one of the largest investment deals in recent years, Fomenta de
Construcciones y Contratas - one of Spain's large private corporations  -
bought a portfolio of office buildings and retail centres for Dollars 350m,
about a third of its peak value two years ago.
In Portugal, the investment market remains underdeveloped, largely because
existing laws give tenants perpetual security of tenure without any
open-market reviews.
The UK property market has performed more strongly than any other European
market, despite the patchy nature of the UK recovery. As bond yields fell
last year, the returns available on well-let UK properties with secure
incomes became increasingly attractive. Investors returned to the market in
force, creating one of the strongest bull markets for good quality property
since the 1970s.
The strength of the revival in the UK office market will not necessarily be
replicated in other European cities. London benefits unusually from the
liquidity and size of the market and the security of income derived from its
long lease structure.
Indeed, predictions of a general recovery in European property markets would
be premature. Nonetheless, if interest rates were to edge downwards, there
should be selective opportunities for investors to buy property at
historically low prices.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity stocks (Recs) were given an uncomfortable ride as
marketmakers, seeking to find a viable trading level for the shares, cut
prices with increasing vigour throughout the session, trying to uncover
cheap buyers.
Utilities specialists were at pains to point out that there was no scare
story or bad news behind the recent bout of weakness in the shares, other
than the slide in index-linked gilts, which often prove a reliable guide to
trends in the utilities. 'There is no big news on these stocks until the
distribution review in the summer,' said one analyst, who added that the rec
yields were approaching all-time relative highs.
The two recs in the FT-SE 100, Eastern and Southern, fell 13 and 14 to 625p
and 635p respectively. Others absorbed even bigger losses, with Norweb 19
off at 649p.
The day's highest volume of the FT-SE 100 constituents was recorded in
conglomerate BTR, which resisted the market's afternoon fall after
surprising dealers with a 13.4 per cent dividend increase and a 19 per cent
improvement in profits.
Turnover at the close was 24m and the shares closed 10 ahead at 387p.
Analysts were particularly cheered by a positive results meeting and several
brokers upgraded current year profit expectations. The list of upgrades
included Strauss Turnbull which raised its forecast from Pounds 1.38bn to
Pounds 1.495bn, a figure which includes gains on disposals.
Bank stocks were sharply in focus as Barclays completed the results season
by announcing disappointing figures. However, an early downturn in the share
price was reversed as analysts returned from the post-results meeting
satisfied with Barclays' strategy plans. 'The figures were bad but the
market is still in love with Martin Taylor (the chief executive),' said one
dealer.
Barclays fell to 488p after the results but rallied to close 8 higher at
510p. Turnover of 18m shares was the heaviest since last year's preliminary
figures, which included the shattering news that the dividend was being cut.
Abbey National, up 9 at 498p, and Lloyds, 11 firmer at 578p, were the other
strong performers in the sector.
A block of 3m National Westminster shares was thought to have been
successfully placed only marginally below the ruling market price. NatWest
ended a penny off at 466p.
Willis Corroon's figures were well received, the shares advancing 16 to 223p
on heavy turnover of 5.6m. Results from Refuge, the life group, proved an
acute disappointment to the market, however, the stock sliding 21 to 359p.
Leading pharmaceutical issues were weak in late trading as news reports said
that Mrs Hillary Clinton, who heads the US administration's health care
reform programme, might have invested in a hedge fund which sold short
several health care stocks last year.
Glaxo closed 2 1/2 lower at 661p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' shed 3 to 395p.
Wellcome declined 9 to 626p, with analysts expecting imminent publication of
last year's Anglo-French Concorde study which found that AZT, the Aids
treatment, was less effective than previously thought.
Smith  Nephew firmed a penny to 144 1/2 p on full-year profits of Pounds
170.6m.
Chemicals stocks were strong against the trend, with Smith New Court
recommending ICI, Courtaulds and Laporte. ICI gained 8 at 775p and started
to show signs of breaking out of a tight range, Courtaulds advanced 11 to
553p and Laporte added 9 at 804p with Hoare Govett also on the bid.
Conglomerate Hanson hardened a penny to 271 1/2 p after announcing the
long-awaited terms for the flotation of its Beazer Homes business in the UK.
Hanson has set a price of 165p per share. It is selling 280.8m shares but
only making 70.2m available to the public.
A rise in profits in line with market expectations from Hillsdown was offset
by a disappointing results meeting. The shares lost 8 at 166p.
Food retailers were generally firm, with SG Warburg reiterating its positive
stance on the sector. Analyst Mr Neil Currie said the downside to further
margin erosion in the industry - an issue which has crippled the supermarket
stocks' rating - was now extremely limited. Warburg is particularly keen on
J. Sainsbury, up 6 at 368p.
Mirror Group Newspapers climbed 12 to 186p on hefty institutional buying
that saw 3.7m shares traded. Next week's results are likely to be well
received.
Advertisers Saatchi  Saatchi rose 5 to 146p ahead of figures due next
Tuesday.
TI Group tumbled 25 to 409p, recording the day's biggest retreat among FT-SE
100 stocks, with analysts unimpressed by the company's post-results meeting.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery stakes offloaded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent heightened activity among drinks stocks burst dramatically into
the open yesterday as Whitbread offloaded a substantial chunk of its
holdings in six domestic brewers in a deal valued by the company at Pounds
225m. The move prompted sharp falls among the stocks, while Whitbread shares
shot forward.
Dealers said BZW had taken on the entire Whitbread holding and sold on the
shares to institutions - one of the biggest bought deals seen in the market.
In the case of Boddington, in which Whitbread had a near 20 per cent stake,
BZW was thought to have bought the stock at 271p a share and placed it at
276p - a 6.5 per cent discount to the overnight price. 'It was brave
broking,' said one rival trader admiringly. Other blocks showed Greene King
being bought at 494p and sold at 499p and Vaux going through at 263 1/2 p
and 266p, a deep discount to the underlying share price.
The Boddington stake was said to have been snapped up quickly, as was the 10
per cent holding in Greene King. Vaux (6 per cent) and Greenalls (3.2 per
cent) were said to have gone smoothly, but there were question marks at the
end of trading as to whether all the 21 per cent in Marston had been
successfully shifted. One trader said some 3m shares remained unsold. The 12
per cent stake in Morland was also thought to have gone through in late
trading.
By the close, Boddington shares had fallen 9 to 286p with 47m turned over,
Greene King was 11 off at 518p on volume of 8.3m, Vaux was steady at 284p
with turnover of 18m, Morland slipped 2 to 508p, and Marston fell 7 to 290p
on 35m. Whitbread surged forward, but faded to close 5 ahead at 552p.
Analysts said the sale wiped out Whitbread's debt and could launch the group
on the acquisition trail, with a retailing outfit in its sights. They added
that the benefit to the group's earnings would result in an upgrade of
profits forecasts of around 3 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reversed after Wall
Street opens - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A setback in the US bond markets had greater effect on London than on other
European financial centres yesterday. UK stocks made good headway in the
first half of the session, encouraged by dividend and profits reports. But
share gains were reversed hurriedly in mid-afternoon when British government
bonds came off the top sharply as US Federal securities opened lower.
Trading volume was moderate, with an increase of nearly 24 per cent in the
day's Seaq total reflecting little more than a burst of activity among
regional brewing stocks as Whitbread unloaded its stakes in 10 smaller
brewers by selling them to one marketmaker, which then passed them on to
institutions.
After an uncertain start, the FT-SE 100 Index advanced by 17.3 to the day's
peak of 3,264, following bond markets which strengthened in response to a
favourable report on the US economy from the Federal Reserve.
Excellent dividend and profits from BTR encouraged a stock market now
looking for its lead from the corporate sector. Barclays Bank and
Rolls-Royce were among others to show evidence of improving trading
conditions for British companies.
The setback, when it came, was swift and the FT-SE 100 ended the day at
3,233.9 for a net loss of 12.8. Weakening sentiment in gilt-edged markets
was quickly translated into falls in stock index futures. Equity traders
were hard put to explain the late fall, but noted political uncertainties in
the US and comments from the president of the Bundesbank, although neither
factor appeared to justify the reversal of trends in UK equities and bonds.
Some strategists said that European markets are likely to turn nervous every
time worries over Federal Reserve intentions resurface.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index escaped the late sell-off but ended 4.6 off at
3,908.4. Seaq volume of 901.1m shares compared with Wednesday's 730.2m,
which was worth a healthy Pounds 1.65bn at retail, or customer, level.
The contrast between the first and second halves of the trading session was
well displayed by the success, in stock market terms, of the Whitbread deal,
which was worth well in excess of Pounds 200m and among the largest of its
type seen in the UK market.
The stocks involved were taken up quickly and without greatly affecting
share prices. 'A bold stroke by a confident marketmaker,' was the comment
heard in the dealing rooms. Whitbread was known to be intending to sell the
share stakes, but the planning of the deal was immaculate.
However, in the afternoon, shares across the Footsie range crumbled when
sentiment turned negative and some traders predicted a weak opening today,
especially if the Dow Average fails to recover from the 24-point fall on
record at the London close.
Although most analysts of the London market appear to agree that the
sell-off of the past three weeks has been overdone, they also warn that the
risk of further losses remains high. European bond markets are still proving
highly sensitive to moves or news from the US Federal Reserve.
With further tightening in Fed credit policies still widely predicted, stock
markets in London and elsewhere in Europe are expected to suffer repeated
bouts of nerves, and yesterday afternoon's performance may prove to be just
one example.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An already fragile London derivatives sector once again came under pressure
late in the session on the back of a retreat in US bonds and early falls on
Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures on the Liffe, the March contract on the FT-SE 100
ended at 3,218, down 19 from its previous close and around 12 points below
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about minus 8.
Sporadic buying of March was seen earlier in the session which sent the
contract to the day's peak of 3,262. But buying interest had faded by
lunchtime, with US houses reported to be leading the market lower
The afternoon slide in bonds increased the selling pressure and March fell
sharply in response. Further selling in after-hours' trading saw March slip
back to 3,203, with volume at 20,414lots. Increased rolling forward into the
June contract brought turnover of 8,203.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 on the Liffe, 106 lots were traded and it closed at
3,907. The same contract on the OMLX saw business of 6 lots and it ended at
3,908.4.
Volume in the Liffe traded options improved to 39,393 contracts. The index
options were the busiest, with 16,270 traded in the FT-SE 100 option and
9,177 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow under pressure from
declining bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Declining bond prices once again put the US stock market under pressure,
with equities posting sizeable losses yesterday in the wake of another big
sell-off in the Treasury market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which at one point had been off almost 40
points, was down a net 22.79 at 3,830.62. The Standard  Poor's 500 weakened
3.16 to 463.90, while the American SE composite slipped 2.01 to 464.78 and
the Nasdaq composite shed 3.96 to 789.09. New York SE trading volume was
369.4m shares.
For the third day in a row, early declines in bond prices prompted selling
of stocks. Yesterday, the losses on the bond market were considerable. By
late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government issue was down 1 1/4 points
and the yield had risen to 6.938 per cent.
Analysts said bonds fell because the market was worried by a decline in the
dollar and a jump in the gold price, both potentially inflationary
developments, and because bond futures prices fell sharply on derivatives
markets.
With long-term yields rising to more than 6.9 per cent, stock market
investors took fright, pushing the Dow sharply lower. Analysts said share
prices were also undermined by speculation in foreign and US markets,
particularly among futures traders, that the rapidly developing Whitewater
scandal was threatening Mr Bill Clinton's presidency.
The day's only economic news - a 32,000 increase in weekly initial
unemployment claims - had little impact on market sentiment, although the
rise in claims was larger than Wall Street had been expecting.
International Paper fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 1/2 , continuing its recent
decline in the wake of a profits warning from the company.
Cyclical shares were hit by selling. Among the biggest losers were Minnesota
Mining  Manufacturing, which receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 104 1/2 ,
Alcoa, with a fall of Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 73 1/8 , and General
Electric, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 104 1/2 .
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up climbed more than Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 5/8 in early
trading on a report that UK confectionery and drinks group Cadbury
Schweppes, which has a 25 per cent equity stake in the former, is interested
in acquiring the rest of the company. Cadbury, however, later poured cold
water on the suggestion, and Dr Pepper retreated to end Dollars  1/2 up at
Dollars 25 1/2 .
The stocks of bank and brokerage companies, whose earnings are likely to be
hit by rising interest rates, were mostly lower. Among banks, Citicorp lost
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 38 1/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars  3/8 at Dollars
31 1/2 , while among brokerage stocks, Salomon dipped Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 51 3/4 and Merrill Lynch Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Spectrum Information Technology rose Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 3 7/16 after Mr John Sculley, its former chairman, dropped his
lawsuit against the company. In the same sector, Intel fell Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 70 1/8 after a California jury ruled against the company in a
copyright case.
Canada
Toronto closed flat after busy trading, with a surge among gold shares
offset by declines in most other groups.
The TSE 300 index lost 1.3 points at 4,443.2 and declines slightly exceeded
rises by 389 to 378 after volume of 100.4m shares. The golds group added 3.4
per cent as the bullion price jumped USDollars 8 an ounce to USDollars
387.35 in New York.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Oil price trend the joker in Oslo's
hand for 1994 - Karen Fossli on prospects for Norwegian equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month Norway hosted the Winter Olympics, and captured 10 gold medals on
home ground. This performance has been echoed in the Oslo stock market,
where Norwegian equities, which slightly outperformed continental Europe in
the bonanza year of 1993, have moved well ahead of a faltering field this
year.
Furthermore, in spite of a recent market setback, and potential for further
weakness and turbulence in the short to medium-term, several analysts
believe that Norwegian shares have plenty of room to move up before they are
fully priced.
The market this year has moved from a fixation on domestic interest rates to
being driven by liquidity and corporate earnings, although interest rates
still remain an important factor.
Blue chip earnings for 1993 have been emerging recently in line with, or
slightly higher than, analysts' forecasts. However, since hitting a high for
the year of 688.23 on February 4, the same day that the Federal Reserve
tightened US monetary policy, the market has shed 4.4 per cent, coming under
recent pressure from firmer interest rates and a weaker dollar.
Norway is served best by a firmer dollar because of its export-driven
industries, consisting mainly of light metals and crude oil production, and
it is here that potential for short-term volatil-ity lies.
Goldman Sachs believes that Norwegian interest rates - currently about 5 per
cent for short rates and 5.84 per cent at the long end - have been
surprisingly resilient in view of recent international turmoil and weaker
oil prices.
The American bank cautions that Norway is dependent on international events
and is likely to continue to take direction from these, but believes that
there is, as yet, little fundamental reason to turn bearish on the longer
term outlook when considering the current valuation of the stock market
relative to interest rates.
It says there is still plenty of room for either the stock market or
interest rates to move up before the historical valuation relationship is
hit. But any negative development in crude oil prices is likely to cause a
dramatic rise in domestic interest rates.
Mr Kjell Skjevesland, a director at the Oslo-based Norse Securities, is also
concerned with the oil price/interest rates connection. Oslo's all-share
index could advance by a further 15 to 20 per cent this year, he says, but
he believes that in the short to medium-term the performance of Norwegian
equities will be determined by oil prices and interest rates.
'If oil prices fall to below Dollars 12 a barrel, alarm bells will sound and
interest rates are likely to shoot up,' he maintains. 'I believe, however,
that the Bundesbank is likely to cut rates in the next couple of weeks,
which will be good news for domestic rates and equities.' The joker, he
emphasises, is the oil price.
Oslo equities should also be supported by the solid condition of the
Norwegian economy. Gross domestic product grew by 2.5 per cent last year and
is expected to expand by between 3 and 3.5 per cent in 1994.
Inflation, at 2.3 per cent in 1993, was among the lowest levels in Europe,
and could sink to below 2 per cent in 1994. Wages last year increased by
just 2.7 per cent, the smallest rise for 30 years, and are expected to
remain unchanged in 1994. Private consumption is forecast to grow by 3 per
cent this year and next, fuelled by higher real wage increases and lower
interest rates.
Mr Michael Thompson, an analyst with James Capel, is very bullish and points
out that in spite of the economic sluggishness of Germany, one of Norway's
main trading partners, Oslo's earnings prospects have improved to the extent
that the market, at this early stage in the year, is already trading on just
14.5 times earnings.
Mr Thompson adds, however, that Oslo's advance could be stemmed by companies
tapping the market for fresh equity. Last year NKr6.6bn was raised, but he
believes that this could increase to NKr8.5bn in 1994.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Bangkok
falls 1.9 per cent
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in the government bond market and a fall in the yen encouraged
investors, and the Nikkei 225 average advanced 1.3 per cent on arbitrage
buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained 251.52 at 20,090.71 after a day's low of 19,880.59, and
high of 20,114.41 just before the close. Foreigners were active buyers in
the afternoon, drawing in domestic individuals and dealers.
Hopes of an easing of tension between the US and Japan over trade also
prompted buying. There was speculation that Mr Ichiro Ozawa, shadow
co-ordinator of the coalition government, would visit the US in an effort to
defuse the trade row. Investors were also cheered by reports that Motorola
and Ido, a Japanese mobile phone company, had reached agreement on increased
foreign access to Japan's mobile phone market.
Concern over the large arbitrage overhang, ahead of the March options and
futures settlements today, subsided following the decline in the balance of
arbitrage positions during the past few days.
Volume amounted to 400m shares, against Wednesday's 332m. Rises led declines
by 649 to 377, with 149 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 11.02 at 1,616.51 and the Nikkei 300 added 2.37 at
298.27. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 4.19 firmer at 1,345.83.
Telecom-related stocks gained ground after fears of trade sanctions by the
US receded. Nitsuko, the most active issue of the day, forged ahead Y150 to
Y1,650 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y13,000 to Y945,000.
Hopes of an increase in revenue supported brokerage issues. Nomura
Securities rose Y90 to Y2,320 and Nikko Securities Y50 to Y1,330. Banks were
lower on profit-taking. Sakura Bank fell Y40 to Y1,370.
Bakery and flour mill shares, which had advanced on speculation of benefits
from increased bread consumption due to the latest rice shortage, also
declined on profit-taking. Yamazaki Baking retreated Y40 to Y2,160 and Nitto
Flour Milling Y11 to Y569.
Higher gold bullion prices supported mining shares. Mitsui Mining and
Smelting moved forward Y10 to Y405 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y30 to Y891.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 137.95 at 22,028.33 in volume of 129m
shares.
Roundup
Trading was largely lacklustre in the region, but technical factors provided
impetus in some markets. Bombay was closed.
BANGKOK fell 1.9 per cent as banks were sold amid growing worries about
their profitability after the central bank's move to raise provisions for
doubtful debt. The SET index shed 26.17 to 1,332.39.
SEOUL began gearing up for a rally on plans to ease deposit restrictions on
investors' stock orders. Under the new regulations, institutional investors
will only need to deposit 20 per cent of the value of buy orders instead of
the current 40 per cent. The composite index edged up 0.73 to 878.58.
AUSTRALIA mustered a rise, although the market was dogged by directionless
trading. The All Ordinaries index put on 8.3 points at 2,155.1 in moderate
turnover of ADollars 480m.
NEW ZEALAND bounced after Wednesday's fall, the NZSE 40 Capital index rising
22.54 to 2,228.74 in thin trading.
MANILA also rallied, although turnover fell sharply as the mood remained
cautious. The composite index moved ahead 50.39, or 2 per cent, to 2,552.84.
HONG KONG was lower as investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The Hang
Seng index dipped 95.33 to 10,129.05 in thin turnover of HKDollars 4.14bn.
SINGAPORE was weakened by interest rate worries. The Straits Times
Industrial index breached the psychologically important 2,200 support level,
falling 28.75 to 2,194.10.
KUALA LUMPUR extended losses at the close as investors further liquidated
positions due to lack of leads from abroad and ahead of the long Hari Raya
holiday next week. The composite index slipped 10.43 to 1,046.0.
COLOMBO was again marked lower, the all-share index shedding 17.62 to
1,328.68 and taking the market's cumulative correction over the last week to
3 per cent, after a near 40 per cent rise since the start of the year.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lose ground on US
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in the US bond markets and, in the afternoon, in their European
counterparts left bourses mainly flat or lower after earlier gains, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT followed the pattern of the week, confident for a while but losing
all, or most of its verve by the end of the day. The Dax index rose 25.01 to
2,141.10 on the session but subsided, finally, to an Ibis-indicated
2,124.51.
Mr John Blackley of James Capel said that German investors saw better
prospects of a rate cut next week or, failing that, after the Fed's open
market committee meets in eleven days' time. Equities, he said, continued to
trail after bonds yesterday; bunds had a good rally in the morning session
but in late afternoon the June bund future was unchanged, after a rise of 60
basis points at one stage.
Turnover was level at DM9bn. Daimler, a current favourite on the switch from
BMW, ended just DM10 better at DM825 in London after an earlier gain of
DM25; Allianz, the insurer, went from DM45 up to DM6 down.
News driven stocks fared worse, Siemens closing just DM2.30 higher at
DM692.30 on the session, and dropping to DM675.50 after hours; Viag was
suspended on its DM2.3bn purchase of Bayernwerk, the electric utility, from
the Bavarian state; Mr Blackley said the price was higher than expected and
Viag could be marked lower today.
PARIS fell as the Bank of France decided not to cut its repo rates, and as
banks in the Paribas orbit seemed to get a sniff of the latter's rights
issue, announced late in the day. BNP fell FFr5.90 to FFr258.10 and Cie
Bancaire by FFr28 to FFr606 as the CAC 40 index fell 15.06 to 2,184.58.
Turnover was FFr4.2bn. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe said that
Paribas, up FFr4 at FFr506, could move on the rights issue today.
The hotel group, Accor, was another major faller, losing FFr14 at FFr716
after the Belgian supreme court rejected its attempt to overturn an August
1992 ruling ordering it to pay more to minority shareholders of its Wagons
Lits acquisition; the estimated cost to Accor is in the region of FFr700m.
ZURICH was firmer but off its best levels after Wall Street's weaker opening
and lower US bond prices. The SMI index added 2.7 to 2,861.2 with some
support emerging from next week's expiry of index futures, with many
investors still believed to be short.
Brown Boveri rebounded after an early fall to finish SFr46 higher at
SFr1,171 on a dividend maintained in spite of high restructuring costs.
Nestle added SFr13 to SFr1,263: the company refused comment on US market
rumours that it planned to buy Gerber, the Michigan-based baby-food maker.
MILAN saw a mixed performance but the Comit index remained in positive
territory adding 0.85 to 663.74.
BCI fell L201 or 3.2 per cent to L6,107 on selling by investors allocated
shares in its privatisation. Of other recently privatised financials, IMI
fell L111 to L12,771 but Credito Italiano picked up L17 to L2,665.
Telecoms had a good day as March 19 was set for a decision on an exchange of
shares as a step towards their ultimate fusion. Stet, the state holding
company, added L93 or 2 per cent to L4,817 and Sip, its main operating
company, gained L180 or 4.3 per cent to L4,363 on reports that its licence
fee would be reduced progressively as compensation for losing its cellular
telephone monopoly.
Fiat bounced L119 higher to L4,970 as investor demand returned. Parmalat
shed L92 or 3.6 per cent to L2,448 in response to results and a bond issue
plan.
AMSTERDAM traded cautiously but found some confidence from a firm bonds
market and the AEX edged up 1.85 to 422.60.
Heineken bounced towards the end of trading and added Fl 2.20 to Fl 201.30.
According to one salesman the market had anticipated the company's good
results - released after the end of the session.
The aircraft maker, Fokker, which dipped in the previous session after its
results, lost a further Fl 2.90 to Fl 15.40. Philips was lifted US
institutional interest and improved Fl 1.40 to Fl 55.20; strong turnover was
seen in Polygram, which added Fl 1.60 to Fl 81.50 as Hoare Govett issued a
positive note on the global music business.
STOCKHOLM saw mixed corporate results, and the Affarsvarlden index fell 5.4
to 1,524.3.
Skandia, which posted record profits after the close on Wednesday, dipped
SKr10 to SKr161 on a planned SKr3bn share issue. Aga B fell SKr10 to SKr423
on results but Asea A were SKr7 higher at SKr604.
Volvo B were SKr7 lower at SKr683 in response to the company's 1993 loss,
due to write-downs of its Renault interests, and news that it may retain its
full 20 per cent shareholding in the French carmaker.
Hennes  Mauritz, the retailer, surged SKr42 or 14 per cent to SKr340 as its
full year pre-tax profits proved well above market expectations.
ISRAEL suffered further erosion of sentiment following recent arrests for
alleged share manipulation. The Mishtanim index fell 8.12 to 202.08.
Blue chips were left at their lowest for the year and of the 1,190 shares,
64 were registering sellers only.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Clinton worries hit dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton's political woes finally caught up with the dollar
yesterday as fears about further damaging disclosures knocked nearly two
pfennigs off the currency, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar weakened in Asia as rumours circulated about President Clinton
resigning, and bearish sentiment spilled over into European and US trading.
It closed in London at DM1.6893, down from DM1.7070 on Wednesday, and in New
York it finished at DM1.6835.
The market is now split on the outlook for the dollar. While many observers
believe economic fundamentals continue to favour it, there is increasing
scepticism about where support for the currency is going to come from.
Either way, the market is now pricing an element of political risk into the
dollar. Until yesterday foreign exchanges had paid little attention to the
Whitewater land and financial scandal in which President Clinton and his
wife are implicated. With the story now grabbing the headlines of the
mainstream US media, however, it has increasingly impinged on the markets.
In Europe, meanwhile, the D-Mark put on a mixed performance. It was
unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.404, stronger against the Italian
lira, which fell to L990.1 from L988.6, and weaker against the Spanish
peseta, which recovered to Pta82.37 from Pta82.45.
Mr Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets, said the
catalyst for yesterday's weakness was increasing market concern that Mr
Clinton 'may find himself in a very, very difficult situation'. He added
that US institutional holders of dollars had been particularly keen to
unload some of their long dollar positions.
This selling needs to be seen against the background of general
disillusionment about the dollar's performance. At the beginning of the year
the US currency was seen by most as a virtual one-way upwards bet. Since
then, however, it has weakened by five pfen-nigs from the DM1.7340 position
where it started the year.
The dollar has also been undermined by the slow pace of monetary easing by
the Bundesbank, and fears that the US Federal Reserve will not tighten
policy as aggressively as previously anticipated.
To some observers it is a case of deja vu. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior
economic adviser at Bank of America, said it was back to a year ago when
bullishness about the dollar stumbled on the rocks of a slower than
anticipated monetary easing from the Bundesbank.
Mr Hawkins said he viewed the current dip in the dollar as a 'temporary',
and perhaps necessary, correction given the extent to which the market had
been long of dollars.
The carrying cost of holding dollar assets - on a one-month view there is a
2.5 per cent interest rate differential in favour of the D-Mark over the
dollar - also bites deeper when the outlook for the currency being held is
called more into question.
The Bank of America economist said there had not been 'huge aggressive
selling' of the dollar. Rather, it was a case of a 'still market looking for
a reason to kick the dollar around a bit'. The spectre of Mr Clinton's
political problems offered just this excuse.
Mr Jeremy Hodges, head of global foreign exchange sales at Lehman Brothers,
took a more gloomy view, commenting: 'I feel strongly that we are into a
downward dollar mode now.' He said he thought the dollar could fall as low
as DM1.60 (also the level Swiss Bank Corp has predicted for the dollar at
the middle and end of the year).
Aside from the interest rate and political risk arguments weighing on the
dollar, Mr Hodges cited two other factors giving reason for caution: that
'everything is priced into this dollar'; and, with investors dumping their
long dollar positions, it is difficult to see who will be willing to buy the
currency.
One option would be the central banks, and there were rumours yesterday that
the New York Federal Reserve was buying dollars just below the DM1.69 level.
It declined to comment.
In Europe, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.10
per cent at a securities repurchase tender, held to inject money into the
money markets. Speculation that the BOF might trim the intervention rate
again - it was cut by 10 basis points on February 24  - receded on Wednesday
when the Bundesbank reduced its corresponding repo rate by only three basis
points.
Sterling had a quiet day with little interest in the currency. The market is
awaiting a raft of important data next week - unemployment, producer prices
and retail sales - to help form a view on the strength of the UK economic
recovery. It closed in London more than a pfennig weaker at DM2.5364 and was
nearly a cent higher against the dollar at Dollars 1.5015.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 731m of assistance
yesterday at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent. The revised forecast of
the shortage was Pounds 700m.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile's troubled copper giant
faces long haul back to health - David Pilling reports on the catalogue of
problems facing Juan Villarzu, Codelco's new president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There cannot be many Chileans who envy Mr his new job. As president of
Codelco Mr Villarzu will from today be expected to grapple with one of the
nation's most contentious issues, the modernisation of the world's largest
copper company.
As if this were not enough, Mr Villarzu is joining a state-owned company
still reverberating from the after-shocks of a futures scandal that caused
losses of at least Dollars 206m - 0.5 per cent of Chile's GDP. Those
rumblings, which have already claimed the jobs of eight executives, threaten
to continue for months, or even years, to come.
There are already suggestions that public condemnation of Codelco's
management team, considered arrogant and unaccountable, might hamper Mr
Villarzu's room for manoeuvre. 'To solve its problems, what Codelco needs is
an aggressive management not a conservative, cautious one,' says a former
company executive. 'But if you are being attacked by everyone all the time
no one will be able to move.'
On the other hand, the futures scandal has provided ample ammunition for
those seeking drastic reform - even privatisation - of what they regard as a
state dinosaur. In a report entitled 'Codelco: The Errors of a Giant', the
right-wing Liberty Institute argues that lack of control over futures
trading was symptomatic of Codelco's unwieldy structure.
Even before the futures fiasco, the incoming administration of
president-elect Eduardo Frei had committed itself to decentralisation and
the creation of a holding company. Last month, Mr Villarzu scrapped the
vice-presidency responsible for mediation between the Santiago headquarters
and its six divisions. He ordered the establishment of divisional
'administrative councils' to 'strengthen decision-making at that level'.
The role of Codelco's politically appointed board - apparently so far
removed from day-to-day decisions that it was unaware of the company's
speculative activities - is also to be examined. Pending too is the issue of
Codelco's contribution to the armed forces, which creams off 10 per cent of
returns from copper sales.
Modernisation is necessary, Mr Villarzu says, because 'costs have been going
up systematically for many years'. During 17 years of military government
Codelco did not develop a single new deposit, the life-blood of any mining
company.
Although Codelco, which produces 12 per cent of the world's copper, provides
Chile with a fifth of its foreign exchange earnings, its importance to the
domestic economy has diminished. Falling ore grades, rising costs and an
appreciating peso have chipped away at the company's treasury contribution.
Although annual production has remained at about 1.2m tonnes, transfers to
the state shrank from Dollars 1.96bn in 1989 to Dollars 891m in 1992. In
1994, that figure could dwindle to just Dollars 30m, according to Mr Jose
Pablo Arellano, budget minister.
To stop the rot, Codelco desperately needs to add a high-grade, low-cost
mine to its ageing quartet. Mr Villarzu has, however, rejected suggestions
that a law permitting joint-ventures with the private sector should be
extended to the development of so-called replacement deposits. 'We don't see
the necessity of insisting on this. . . We believe Codelco can exploit such
reserves on its own,' he says.
But it is unclear where the money for this will come from. Any hope that the
finance ministry, which sets Codelco's investment budget, will provide the
estimated Dollars 400m for Radomiro Tomic (a deposit with annual production
potential of 150,000 tonnes) have been severely dented. The government,
which is committed to social spending, may find it politically untenable to
divert precious resources to a state company that has just gambled away
millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.
Neither does the joint-venture alternative now look so unequivocally
attractive. The great fanfare over the commitment of Cyprus Amax/Lac
Minerals to pay Dollars 555m for a 51 per cent stake of the El Abra deposit
has died down following serious delays to contract signing.
Mr Villarzu may have to seek alternative solutions. Much discussed has been
the possibility of selling Codelco's non-core activities, such as the
Rancagua workshop or the 530MW thermo-electric power station at Tocapilla,
believed to be worth Dollars 600m.
Another idea - not included in recent capital markets legislation - is to
allow Codelco to borrow cash for new projects from Chile's private pension
funds, which have assets of Dollars 16bn.
Bringing new deposits on stream is only one task. Mr Villarzu is also
committed to lowering production costs at existing mines, which average 69
cents a pound, compared with an estimated 55-60 cents at the country's
private mines.
This year's target is to trim production costs by 3 cents. Groundwork has
been prepared by the previous management which managed to halt, if not
reverse, the seemingly inexorable rise in costs. This was achieved by
gradual staff cuts (to 22,000 from 27,000 in 1988), contracting out
peripheral activities, a crackdown on absenteeism and freezing wages and
productivity bonuses.
All this has further soured relations with union leaders, who blame
management negligence for the futures fiasco. And they are likely to regard
the break-up of Codelco as a surreptitious step towards privatisation.
But Codelco is no ordinary company and 'privatisation' is a word few dare
utter openly. Mr Villarzu is implacable. 'I am not in favour of privatising
Codelco,' he says. 'I am not in favour of privatising any state copper
company.'
For him the ultimate goal is clear: to 'transform Codelco into one of the
world's most profitable mining companies'. But, to achieve this, there will
have to be some drastic changes.
Mr Villarzu may yet have a surprise or two up his sleeve.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US funds 'turning to silver
market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KALGOORLIE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US speculative funds that last year drove up the gold price have turned
their attention to silver, Mr Tim Green, consultant to the Gold Fields
Minerals Services consultancy group, said yesterday.
Talk in the market suggested they were targeting prices of USDollars 7,
Dollars 8 or even Dollars 9 a troy ounce, compared with last night's closing
London price of Dollars 5.37 1/2 , he added.
Mr Green pointed out that the US speculators were more 'at home' with
silver, which was a much more volatile market than gold. 'It is possible to
double the silver price in a year but that's not possible with gold. Also
there are no central bank sales to threaten the funds' strategy in the
silver market.'
He suggested at the Kalgoorlie Gold Conference that, because many
computer-based trading systems used by funds linked gold and silver prices,
any upward surge in silver would take gold along with it 'but not to Dollars
500 an ounce'.
Mr Green said the funds realised that the market was 'a good play' following
an astonishing rise in silver imports to India after that country
liberalised imports of the metal. This resulted in India importing 3,500
tonnes of silver last year, double the 1992 level and easily an all time
record.
Gold jewellery makers in the US were consuming 200 to 300 tonnes a year, or
double the quantity widely quoted in the industry, suggested Mr Jeffrey
Nichols, managing director of the American Precious Metals Advisors
consultancy organisation.
He said there was probably similar underestimation of gold jewellery
fabrication demand in other industrialised countries. 'This means that the
total world gold market supply demand balance is more bullish that can be
statistically documented,' he added.
Gold Fields Minerals Services' annual review of the gold market is the most
widely quoted statistical reference book and Mr Green said the organisation
had looked carefully when similar claims to Mr Nichols' had been made in the
past but it remained satisfied with its figures.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee price rally stalled -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE chalked up fresh three month highs at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday and held on to most of their gains. But traders said prices seemed
to have stalled at predicted resistance.
The May futures position closed at Dollars 1,280 a tonne, up Dollars 20,
after being pushed to Dollars 1,285 earlier by trade buying and speculative
interest.
London Metal Exchange dealers said ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices finished
nicely positioned to build on stability and push higher. Three months
delivery Copper ended after hours 'kerb' trading unchanged on the day at
Dollars 1,906 after declines below Dollars 1,900 had failed to trigger
stop-loss selling. Three months ALUMINIUM also came through a test of
underlying support, ending at Dollars 1,285 a tonne, up Dollars 6, after
dipping earlier towards the downside chart point between Dollars 1,270 and
Dollars 1,275.
The London GOLD price built on Wednesday's rally, with 'quite aggressive'
physical buying lifting it Dollars 5.45 to Dollars 385 a troy ounce, dealers
said. The main impetus again came from investment fund buying at the New
York Commodity Exchange, where traders cited South African election worries
and the Whitewater affair among possible influences.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand was the outstandingly strong wool market this week, with a
complete clearance and prices rising by 10pc or more compared with a strong
and dearer sale last week. Crossbred wool is now recognised as likely to be
in short supply in the months ahead, and some traders are believed to be
oversold. A surge in Chinese buying set off the latest rise, coupled with a
market background already increasing in strength. China also played a part
in what happened at Australian wool sales, with medium and broader Merinos
and crossbreds appreciably dearer while finer Merinos, previously favoured,
tended to level out. So far there are only some signs of better business
experienced by processors and manufacturers, accompanying the wool market
rise. The official Wool International Australian market indicator was
546c/kg on Wednesday.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cut-price coal stokes up
industry row in Australia - Nikki Tait on an acrimonious dispute sparked by
the latest supply deals with Japanese steel mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All is not well in Australia's coal industry. Last week, hundreds of
striking miners swarmed across the grassy knoll at Parliament House,
protesting at the recent price-cuts agreed between the nation's coking coal
producers and the Japanese steel mills. The miners' six-day protest action
shut down mines in Queensland and New South Wales. Coal companies costed the
lost production at ADollars 170m.
The two sides are due to meet at the Australian Coal Industry Council on
Monday, a tripartite discussion forum brokered by Mr David Beddall, the
federal resources minister. On the union side, there is a demand for an
inquiry into pricing and, underlying this, a long-standing suggestion that
Australia should negotiate its annual coal contracts with the all-important
Japanese buyers on a collective, not an individual company, basis.
Coal, after all, is the country's biggest export, and over 40 per cent goes
to Japan. If the buyers are working as a cartel, doesn't it make sense for
suppliers to do likewise?
From the companies' side comes a warning that even an inquiry of this nature
could send damaging signals to customers. If anything is to emerge, says Mr
Denis Porter at the New South Wales Coal Association, it should be a review
which looks more broadly at obstacles to growth in the industry's
efficiency, not 'a witch-hunt into pricing'.
The unusual aspect to this spat is that parts of the financial community,
including broking houses like BZW and Potter Warburg, are equally critical
of the producers' deal-making. Without necessarily endorsing the union
notion of a 'national coal marketing board', analysts say that the
Australian-Japanese negotiations, which set an international marker for coal
prices, have become ritualised, and that this works to the sellers'
detriment.
The latest round, comments one analyst, 'was not a well thought-out
marketing effort. There didn't seem to be much co-ordination between
producers. . . When the Japanese offered something ridiculous, they got
frightened'.
The coking coal agreements were finalised in late-January. As usual, one
company led the round, in this case Broken Hill Proprietary. When the
agreement was unveiled, it showed price cuts ranging from 8.5 to 9.5 per
cent (in US dollar terms) for hard coking coal, and around 8 to 8.5 per cent
for soft. This was the fourth successive year that coking coal prices had
fallen, and even producers admitted they were shocked by the size of the
1994 drop. Coal shares tumbled.
BHP defended the deal on the grounds that Canadian producers, despite their
cost disadvantage, were waiting to snap up market share. More generally,
producers pointed to the enormous problems confronting the Japanese steel
mills at present, and to longer-term developments in steel-making technology
which mitigate against much upturn in coking coal demand.
No one, not even the unions, denies the buyers' parlous situation. But the
industry's critics point out that the Japanese are adept at picking off
large producers who will take bigger price cuts by offering them more
attractive tonnages. In a business with high fixed costs, this can be
persuasive. But it can also spell big problems - leading to downsizing and
lost jobs - for the smaller producers who are then obliged to mop up.
At the very least, critics think the system could be shaken up. Price
negotiations for steaming coal, where underlying prospects are brighter than
for coking coal, could go ahead of coking coal, perhaps. The coal companies
could pay more early attention to other Asian buyers, instead of being
fixated with Japan. More speculatively, the notion of establishing a coal
equivalent of the London Metal Exchange could be considered.
Mr Leigh Clifford, CRA group executive for energy resources, says this would
only add dangerous volatility. 'Sure, the price can go up, but it can also
go down,' he comments. 'And you can't do anything about it'.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall sharply in late trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After weakening in the morning on a higher gold price and a weak dollar, US
bonds dropped sharply yesterday afternoon.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 1/4 at 91 11/32 ,
yielding 6.938 per cent, and the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 3/8 ,
yielding 4.944 per cent.
A lack of economic statistics left the market without a clear direction at
the opening. In generally listless trading, dealers focused on a rise in the
gold price, and a decline in the dollar against leading European currencies
 -both deemed bearish for bonds. The market was also unnerved by rumours
that President Clinton was facing a political crisis because of the
Whitewater affair.
During the afternoon, however, prices turned decisively lower, triggered by
falls in the 30-year bond and the June bond futures contract below important
support levels.
True to the recent pattern, European government bonds firmed in the morning
but fell back in the afternoon on the back of weaker US Treasuries.
Traders could not identify a clear trigger for the weakness, although it was
exacerbated by rumours that the Bundesbank would revise its January M3 money
supply growth data upwards. At an annualised rate of 20.6 per cent in
January, M3 has already massively overshot its 4 to 6 per cent target range.
The market was also abuzz with talk of more hedge-fund selling, although one
observer pointed out that volume on the futures exchanges did not seem to
indicate any selling as dramatic as last week.
'We're still very much in a bear market,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond
strategist with market analysts IDEA. 'In the morning, the market traded up
on thin volume, but when prices fell, volume was huge,' he said. This
indicates that 'there is no one out there supporting the up-moves,' he said.
Moderately encouraging comments from senior Bundesbankers failed to stem the
late slide in bunds.
Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said the pursuit of anti-inflation
policies did not mean interest rates should stay unchanged, and also
welcomed the recent pay deal in the engineering sector. However, he added
that inflation was still too high and the Bundesbank would continue tracking
M3 as a key indicator.
Bundesbank council member Hans-Jurgen Koebnick said easing monetary policy
in Germany would not be affected by a rise in US short-term rates. 'In
Germany . . . we expect inflation to fall, whereas there are fears of rising
inflation in the US. Domestic factors will primarily determine both the
tempo and the extent of the lowering of German rates.'
The dollar's weakness against the D-Mark also supported bunds. The June bund
futures contract on Liffe ended at 96.40, up 0.05 points on the day but
below its 97.01 high.
UK gilts largely tracked bunds, erasing their early gains to end little
changed. Index-linked bonds put on a strong performance in the morning but
fell in the afternoon, with traders reporting a large switch into
conventional stock. The June long gilt future ended at 112 5/8 , up 1/16 .
French bonds underperformed bunds, partly on disappointment that the Bank of
France left interest rates unchanged. The notional March bond future on
Matif fell 0.08 points to 125.34.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB fills gaps in yield curve
with two new products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Futures traders are gearing up for the launch of two interest-rate contracts
on the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's financial futures exchange.
Today is the first day of trading in the DTB's long-term 'Buxl' future,
based on bonds issued by the German government and the Treuhandanstalt with
a remaining maturity of between 15 and 30 years. Next Friday, the
screen-based exchange plans to launch its long-awaited Fibor future, a
three-month interest-rate contract based on the Frankfurt inter-bank offered
rate.
'Now the spectrum will be complete - anyone who trades this market can play
the whole yield curve without any gaps,' said Mr Ralf Lemster, head of
derivatives sales and trading at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. The DTB already
lists five-year and 10-year bond futures.
Mr Jorg Franke, DTB chairman, said the Buxl future had been launched to meet
increased demand for long-dated debt, especially from international
investors.
'The rise in issuance at this part of the yield curve has shown that there
is a real need for long-dated bonds in the cash market,' and a hedging
instrument was needed to round off the picture, he said. Since December
1993, Germany has issued DM27bn of 22-year and 30-year bonds.
Despite some concern over the liquidity of the underlying market, most are
confident that the Bundesbank's commitment to reinforcing Frankfurt's
position as a financial centre will ensure a steady supply.
'I expect to see at least one 30-year bond every six months - that's not a
lot, but enough,' said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at
NatWest Markets in Frankfurt.
Volatility in the 10-year bund future has jumped sharply following recent
market turbulence, and an even longer dated instrument is likely to be even
more volatile.
'It's not the easiest instrument to trade, but if we want to be an
international market, we have to offer these types of products,' said Mr
Lemster.
Moreover, said Mr Franke, the contract would offer cash investors a way to
hedge their very long dated positions during turbulent market conditions,
while providing short-term traders with a speculative instrument.
The Fibor future may be slower to take off, largely because Liffe already
lists a similar contract based on the British Bankers Association interest
settlement rate for three-month Euromark deposits.
'The Fibor future could be a flop,' said one dealer, noting that
'duplicating another exchange's products has never worked'. Moreover, he
feels that there is not enough Fibor-based business around to justify
creating a Fibor contract.
But others say that is precisely why it is needed. 'Once the Fibor future is
in place, it could spur the development of more Fibor-based instruments,'
said Mr Franke.
Some fear the underlying market may not be broad enough without issuance of
short-term government paper but hopes for such debt were dashed yesterday
when Bundesbank council member Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the issuance of
treasury bills could interfere with the central bank's monetary policy.

The Budapest Stock Exchange has issued a list of international financial
institutions that would be allowed, if they so requested, to introduce
Hungarian forint-denominated securities on the bourse, Reuter reports from
Budapest.
The list was drawn up after the bourse amended its rules to allow foreign
financial institutions to bring such securities.
However, a stock exchange official said that Hungarian securities law would
also have to be amended before foreign institutions could introduce
forint-denominated securities. He added that this was under way.
The bourse listed the following organisations:
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European
Investment Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Finance
Corporation, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The Inter-American Development Bank, the Nordic Development Bank, the
Caribbean Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian
Development Bank were also on the list.
Hungary's move to allow foreign institutions to list on the stock exchange
was triggered by the EBRD's plan to introduce a forint-denominated bond on
the Budapest bourse.
'The bourse council wanted to make it possible for the securities of these
financial institutions to appear (on the bourse),' a stock exchange
spokesman said. He added, however, that 'no official request has come from
any of them yet.'

US Treasury prices eased across the maturity range in listless trading
yesterday morning, with traders attributing the declines to a higher gold
price and the dollar's weakness.
Just before midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 21/32 at
91 15/16 , yielding 6.887 per cent, and the two-year note was down  1/16 at
99 13/32 , yielding 4.927 per cent.
The lack of important economic statistics meant the market lacked a clear
direction from the opening. The day's only release of any significance - a
32,000 increase in weekly jobless claims - had no discernible impact on
prices.
Instead, dealers focused on a rise in the gold price and a decline in the
dollar against leading European currencies - both deemed bearish for bonds.
Otherwise, sentiment remained subdued, with investors reluctant to commit
funds to a market still vulnerable to sudden and sharp sell-offs.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Surprise Dollars 3bn FRN issue from
Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Sweden's launch of a Dollars 3bn floating-rate note issue
caught the international bond market by surprise yesterday, with many
participants startled by the sheer size of the deal and the borrower's
audacity in tapping the market at such a difficult time.
Some syndicate officials claimed there was still plenty of seven-year paper
left over from Sweden's last sortie into the market in January. 'This smacks
of desperation - the markets are not in good shape and this is just putting
more spread pressure on the borrower's name,' said one rival syndicate
manager.
'This might be good for the lead manager's position in the league table but
it's going to take some time to sell,' added another.
Sweden's latest offering has an 18-month maturity and a coupon of 18.75
basis points below three-month Libor. The proceeds will be used to pay off
part of an Ecu5bn bank facility put in place at the time of Sweden's
currency crisis and which matures in September 1995. CS First Boston, the
lead manager, said Sweden had secured a lower borrowing cost in the bond
market, compared with a margin of  3/16 over Libor on the bank facility.
The lead claimed that in current market conditions investors want to be
invested in cash or very short-dated paper. 'This is a cash substitute, a
temporary parking place for investors to put their money,' said one
official, pointing out that investors would get a coupon of about 3 3/4 per
cent, against overnight money rates of 3 1/8 to 3 1/4 per cent.
CS First Boston put together a selling group rather than a formal syndicate
and underwrote the entire issue. It said it was supporting the deal at a
price of 99.91 - 99.92. First National Building Society, Ireland's second
largest building society, has launched the first ever issue of floating-rate
PIBS - Permanent Interest Bearing Shares.
The Pounds 25m issue counts as tier one capital and the paper will be priced
to yield 255 basis points over six-month Libor, which is currently around 5
1/8 per cent. Hoare Govett, the lead manager, said First National wanted to
'gear up its balance sheet and have a war chest ready' in preparation for
possible acquisitions in Ireland or the UK.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Department store side hampers
Coles Myers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coles Myers, Australia's largest retailer, yesterday announced a rise of
just 3.6 per cent in after-tax profits during the six months to January 23,
and a 2.9 per cent improvement in group sales.
It blamed the weak figures on the nation's lingering unemployment and a
disappointing performance by Myer Grace Bros, its department store division.
Coles profits after tax totalled ADollars 245.1m (USDollars 176.3m) in the
six-month period, compared with ADollars 236.6m in the same 1992-93
half-year. Sales reached ADollars 8.16bn, up from ADollars 7.93bn. Operating
profits, before tax, slipped slightly, from ADollars 367.7m to ADollars
361.8m. Net interest charges were virtually unchanged.
The biggest problems came in the department store division, where operating
profits fell sharply, from ADollars 94.2m to ADollars 63.2m, on static sales
of ADollars 1.81bn. Coles said the division had been forced to clear 'a high
level of overstocked items' via some 'aggressive' markdowns. The group has
already made management changes in this area, and is looking for an
improvement in the second half.
The supermarkets division fared better, pushing up operating results from
ADollars 89.2m to ADollars 101.9m, while the Kmart discount stores advanced
from ADollars 86.7m to ADollars 91.4m.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Profits fall prompts warning at
Cathay

<TEXT>
Cathay Pacific Airways, Swire Pacific's Hong Kong-based international
airline, yesterday unveiled a 23.8 per cent drop in profits, to HKDollars
2.29bn (USDollars 296.2m) for calendar 1993, against HKDollars 3.01bn the
previous year. It warned that this year was going to be just as tough.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said: 'In the short-term, we will continue to see
overcapacity on the major routes. We will continue to have high inflation in
Hong Kong and, as a result, frankly I don't see the results of 1994 being
much better or very different from those of 1993.'
Cathay is under increasing pressure on its prime routes, particularly with
the introduction of a Virgin Atlantic service between Hong Kong and the UK.
Mr Sutch said the fall in earnings - which was slightly less steep than
analysts had expected, partially due to contained costs - reflected a
downturn in demand in key markets, spiralling operating costs driven by the
colony's high inflation, and the flight attendants' strike at the start of
the financial year.
The industrial action, precipitated by the dismissal of three air hostesses
after they refused to temporarily fill junior positions during staff
shortages, cost the company an estimated HKDollars 240m in extra costs and
lost revenue.
Total yield was 8.2 per cent lower than the previous year, and the revenue
load factor also dropped, down 1.5 per cent to 68.9 per cent as continued
recession in key markets depressed ticket sales.
However, directors are proposing to hold the final dividend at 31.5 cents,
in line with last year's payout. Earnings per share slipped to 80 cents,
down from HKDollars 1.05.
'It was a difficult year, not just for our company but for the airline
industry as a whole. The overall performance was a great deal better than
most other airlines in the world, but we take little comfort from that given
the industry as a whole is in a pretty torrid state,' said Mr Sutch.
Where Cathay was at a sharper disadvantage to its competitors was the
inflationary environment in the colony, he said. Cathay has already sought
to mitigate the damage by transferring its accounts division across the
border to Guangzhou, establishing a computer centre in Sydney, and
stationing flight crews in other parts of the region.
Despite these and other moves to enhance competitiveness and efficiency
profit margins slumped further, to 9.6 per cent, down from 12.9 per cent in
1992.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Accounting change hits WD  HO
Wills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WD  HO Wills, the Australian tobacco group 67 per cent-owned by BAT
Industries, saw net profits fall 52.1 per cent to ADollars 15.4m (USDollars
11.1m) in the year to the end of December, on unchanged sales of ADollars
934m.
However, the decline was entirely due to a large ADollars 62.9m abnormal
item (up from a ADollars 10.3m charge the previous year).
Of this, ADollars 43.5m was explained by a change in the accounting basis
for tobacco licence fees. The remainder was attributed to restructuring
costs and property write-downs in manufacturing and distribution operations.
Wills said the underlying performance had been 'robust,' although sales
volume in Australia was down by just over 6 per cent in 1993, a trend it
blamed on tax rises.
Operating profits for the group overall, before abnormals and tax, rose 24.4
per cent to ADollars 84.9m.
The company's Papua New Guinea operations saw 'solid' profits growth,
although some overall market share was lost. The Fiji and Solomon Islands
operations had 'good years'.
Wills also announced plans to install a ADollars 40m tobacco leaf primary
processing plant at its Pagewood factory, and said it had decided to
contract out its distribution operations. This change will start to take
effect in the latter half of 1994.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: US foods group links with SA
producer

<TEXT>
CPC International, the US-based multinational foods group, has invested R92m
(Dollars 26.5m) in a joint venture with Tongaat-Hulett, the
Anglo-American-owned aluminium, sugar and foods producer. The deal marks the
biggest re-investment in South Africa since the lifting of American
sanctions.
It follows the return of a number of US companies to South Africa this year,
including International Business Machines and Kodak. Pilsbury, a rival US
foods group, set up a partnership with local producer FoodCorp last year,
and Heinz is understood to be investigating a South African partnership,
possibly with the Premier Group.
CPC has exercised its option to buy a 50 per cent stake in Tongaat's
consumer foods division. The option was part of a licensing and technology
agreement signed by the companies in October 1993. The new company - CPC
Tongaat Foods - will invest R10m in a new dry foods plant.
The deal is complicated by CPC's disinvestment from South Africa in 1987,
when it sold the rights to a number of its brands - including Knorr,
Hellmann's and Marmite - to Hunt Leuchars  Hepburn, a local foods supplier.
CPC Tongaat Foods will be restricted to marketing these brands outside South
Africa, Namibia and Botswana. However, it plans to introduce and produce the
rest of CPC's product range in South Africa for the local and sub-Saharan
export markets.
Mr Mohammed Wahby, vice-president of CPC Europe Consumer Foods, admitted
South Africa and many neighbouring countries faced severe political
troubles. However, he said: 'One should not wait for a solution to all
political problems before launching a sound business proposal.'
Mr Cedric Savage, managing director of Tongaat, said it was vital for South
Africans to establish joint ventures with international companies.

BTR Nylex, the quoted Australian offshoot of Britain's BTR group, yesterday
announced after-tax profits of ADollars 401.2m (USDollars 288.6m) for 1993,
a 9.8 per cent increase over 1992's ADollars 365.4m. Sales rose 8.4 per cent
to ADollars 6.21bn.
The diversified manufacturing group's operating profit, ahead of 'corporate
activities,' rose 7.7 per cent, to ADollars 855.2m. BTR Nylex attributed the
advance to 'the long-awaited improvement in economic conditions, together
with more efficient operating performance' in its core Australasian
businesses. It reported increased demand from customers in the automotive,
packaging and construction-related sectors.
Sales in Australasia rose to ADollars 3.27bn from ADollars 3.03bn, while
operating profit was ADollars 499.3m against ADollars 439.2m.
The North American interests also made progress, pushing up sales to
ADollars 1.12bn from ADollars 978.4m, and increasing operating profits to
ADollars 148.6m from ADollars 130.6m. BTR said new contracts at Continental
PET contributed to the advance.
However, operating profits in Asia were flat, at ADollars 117.3m against
ADollars 118.6m. The company said much of the region saw an improvement, but
that pricing and capacity pressures in Taiwan affected the polymer
businesses.
Europe took a larger profits tumble, down from ADollars 105.5m to ADollars
90m, a trend blamed on 'stagnant and competitive market conditions' and
restructuring disruptions at Rockware.
However, the group sounded a cheery note on current-year prospects, saying
the improving economies in North America and Australasia and the sustained
demand from Asia should be beneficial.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bridge Oil postpones flotation
of US offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas group, has postponed the proposed
stock-market flotation of its US operation, Bridge Oil (USA). It blamed
'current uncertainty' over crude oil prices.
The Sydney-based Bridge announced yesterday it intended to re-examine this
plan in the third quarter of 1994. It unveiled the flotation scheme in
December, and had hoped to finalise the transaction in the first quarter of
1994.
Bridge considered floating off the US oil and gas properties before, but was
thwarted by a previous fall in gas prices. Yesterday's announcement came as
it reported net profits of ADollars 27.6m (USDollars 19.8m) in the year to
end-December, compared with ADollars 39.4m last time. The figure was scored
after an abnormal surplus of ADollars 486,000, against ADollars 4.76m in
1992.
Pancontinental Mining, which was defeated in the bid battle for Aztec Mining
by Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's PosGold Investments, said yesterday it
had not served offer documents on the target earlier this week - and hence
did not have an offer for Aztec which was outstanding.

charge, shed 4,400 jobs

<TEXT>
Raytheon, the Massachusetts-based defence group, is to cut up to 4,400 jobs,
or 7 per cent of its workforce, over the next two years and will take a
Dollars 162m after-tax charge in the first quarter to cover the
restructuring.
The move is the latest in the consolidation of the US defence industry,
which has been struggling with sharply lower Pentagon spending since the
collapse of the Soviet empire.
Raytheon said 65 per cent of the charges related to its defence business and
the rest to its commercial operations, which include the manufacture of
aircraft and appliances, as well as engineering and construction work.
Raytheon, best known for manufacturing the Patriot missile, said that
despite the charge, which works through at Dollars 1.20 a share, it will
still be profitable in the first quarter. It had net income of Dollars
157.5m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, in the same period of 1993.
The company is one of the largest employers in New England and the
centrepiece of its restructuring plan is the consolidation of its missile
manufacturing operations in the region into its Andover, Massachusetts,
plant.
This will result in the closure of facilities in Lowell, Northboro and
Norwood, Massachusetts.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: AMD wins round in Intel fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US court has reaffirmed Advanced Micro Devices' rights to use Intel
technology to compete in the lucrative microprocessor market. The jury
verdict, reached yesterday, represents a serious blow to Intel, the world's
largest chip maker.
AMD can use Intel's 'microcode', the internal software in a microprocessor
chip, the jury determined. It found that a 1976 licensing agreement between
the two companies granted the company the right to use the copyrighted
programs. During the trial, Intel argued that the agreement did not extend
to microcode.
The verdict ended a long-standing dispute between the two Silicon Valley
chip makers. In 1992, Intel won the first trial of the same case, but the
verdict was subsequently set aside when Intel was alleged to have withheld
relevant documents.
For AMD, the new verdict removes a serious threat that could, at least
temporarily, have forced the company to withdraw from the microprocessor
market.
'We feel that this verdict is a major, major victory,' said Mr W. J. Sanders
III, chairman and chief executive officer of AMD. 'For nearly a decade,
AMD's growth, profitability and indeed very existence have been threatened
by Intel's unwillingness to live up to its agreements with AMD, preferring
to compete in the courtroom instead of the marketplace. We are deeply
gratified that our rights have now been confirmed by the unanimous verdict
of a federal jury.'
Mr Sanders said that he was asking Intel 'to accept this verdict, recognise
that competition can be beneficial even to Intel, and end the harassment of
AMD in the courts'. However, Intel said that it would appeal against the
verdict and continue to pursue outstanding issues in two related disputes
between the companies.
'We now have two distinctly different jury verdicts,' said Mr Thomas Dunlap,
Intel general counsel. 'Therefore, the Court of Appeals must now decide
which verdict stands.
'AMD has always had the option of competing fairly in the market place by
writing its own microcode. If they chose to do that these disputes will be
resolved.'
Intel dominates the market with close to 90 per cent market share. 'Intel
made more profits in 1993 than the next nine semiconductor manufacturers
together,' noted Mr Sanders.
AMD said that it plans to ship over 900,000 Intel-style 486 microprocessors
in the current quarter, up from 350,000 in the last quarter, and is aiming
for a 25 per cent share of the world market for PC microprocessors. By
removing the legal cloud over AMD the verdict could boost demand for its
microprocessors, the company said.
Intel shares closed at Dollars 70 1/8 , down from yesterday's close of
Dollars 71 5/8 , while AMD shares rose from Dollars 22 3/4 to Dollars 29.

package

<TEXT>
International Business Machines gave a 'golden boot' to Mr John Akers, its
former chairman and chief executive, who retired last April under pressure
from the board of directors as a result of the company's worsening financial
performance.
According to a shareholders' proxy statement issued today, Mr Akers received
a severance package of about Dollars 3.4m. This included Dollars 2.5m,
equivalent to one year's compensation, as part of a retirement incentive
programme.
In addition, the former IBM chairman was awarded a Dollars 925,000 payment,
equivalent to his annual base salary 'in recognition of his 33 years of
service to the company'.
Other payments for 1994 totalled Dollars 433,333 in salary and bonus for the
four months that he remained with the company.
Yesterday, IBM also announced that it had laid off 800 workers in New York
state. The layoffs are part of a planned reduction of 30,000 jobs. IBM said
that it aimed to reduce its workforce to about 225,000, from 256,000 last
July.

for year
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent
increase in profits after financial items to SKr1.56bn (Dollars 195m) for
1993, chiefly due to the weakness of the Swedish krona and the consolidation
of newly-acquired cold storage companies in France and Germany.
The company said it expected a further improvement in 1994 as the economies
in key markets improved and the benefits of rationalisation fed through. It
is raising the dividend to SKr10 per share from SKr9 per share last year and
proposes a five-for-one share split.
Consolidation of the French company CEGF and German Bremerhavener
Kuhlhauser, both acquired at the end of 1992, and the sharp fall in the
value of the Swedish krona last year helped push up group sales by 35 per
cent to SKr16.06bn from SKr11.87bn in 1992.
Operating profits were also up 28 per cent at SKr1.65bn, compared with
SKr1.29bn in 1992. Aga said most gas operations improved operating margins.
Frigoscandia, the cold storage and food processing business, reported
operating profits up dramatically at SKr275m from SKr145m thanks to the new
acquisitions.
Net financial expenses, excluding dividends and positive exchange rate
adjustments, leapt to SKr327m from just SKr3m in 1992. Net borrowings
increased to SKr4.4bn from SKr3.3bn.

Most of the main companies associated with Hyundai, one of South Korea's
leading business groups, reported higher profits and sales for 1993,
although several of its smaller concerns recorded losses.
Hyundai Corporation, the group's trading arm, reported that net earnings
rose by 3.7 per cent to Won5.45bn (Dollars 6.7m), although sales fell by 1.6
per cent to Won11,000bn as overseas shipments were disrupted by strikes
affecting several Hyundai companies last summer.
Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car manufacturer, had a 39 per cent
increase in net profits to Won58.2bn as sales rose by 18 per cent to
Won7,180bn due to strong exports benefiting from a weak Korean Won.
The domestic car sales division, Hyundai Motor Service, suffered a 32 per
cent drop in net profits to Won17.3bn as low-interest consumer financing
offered by the company to boost sales put pressure on earnings. Sales
increased by 20.9 per cent to Won3,903bn.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction had a 9 per cent increase in earnings
to Won20.7bn as sales rose by 3 per cent to Won2,774bn.
South Korea's largest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, reported that
net profits declined by 21 per cent to Won221bn in 1993 as sales fell by 12
per cent to Won2,170bn.
The results reflected lower profit margins on ships ordered in 1992 and
delivered last year. Industrial disputes at the shipyard last summer also
depressed sales.
However, HHI, which is seeking a listing on the Seoul bourse, remains the
subsidiary with the largest profits in the Hyundai group.
Hyundai Precision  Industry, the world's leading container manufacturer,
had a loss of Won48.9bn in 1993 against a profit of Won5.5bn in 1992 due to
a drop in exports. Sales, however, increased by 6.3 per cent to Won1,340bn.
Inchon Iron  Steel had a 20.5 per cent fall in profits to Won11.5bn,
although sales rose by 18 per cent to Won1,083bn. It blamed the earnings
decline on a rise in the international prices for scrap steel.
Hyundai Pipe, the nation's largest steel pipe maker, had a loss of Won4.9bn
against a profit of Won1.2bn in 1992. It blamed the earnings drop on price
competition from manufacturers in developing nations. Sales increased by 24
per cent to Won321bn.
Hyundai Wood Industries, a timber and furniture company, had a loss of
Won4.5bn against a profit of Won1.9bn in 1992. Sales rose by 22.6 per cent
to Won397bn. Keum-Kang Development, an owner of department stores and
hotels, took a loss of Won4.9bn against a profit of Won3bn in 1992.

Hudson's Bay, Canada's biggest department store group, kept up the pace of
recovery in the final quarter of fiscal 1994 with a 3.4 per cent improvement
in revenues to CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn), and net profit up 12 per
cent to CDollars 103.8m, or CDollars 1.90 a share, from CDollars 92.2m, or
CDollars 1.83, a year earlier.
At the operating level, the Bay stores improved profit sharply and the
Zellers discount chain continued to gain strength. Zellers is now the
biggest segment of the Bay's business.
For the full year ended January 31, revenues were up 5.6 per cent to
CDollars 5.4bn and net profit was CDollars 147.7m, or CDollars 2.72 a share,
against CDollars 116.7m, or CDollars 2.32, including a CDollars 8.3m special
gain. The company said that in spite of heavy retail competition, the Bay
was well positioned to continue the better trend in profits.
However, Wal-mart of the US has just entered the Canadian market by buying
120 Woolco discount stores and will become a direct competitor of Zellers.
The Bay declared a quarterly dividend 23 cents a share, up 15 per cent,
payable on April 30 to shareholders of record on April 8.
The dividends will be paid to UK and US shareholders at CDollars 2.037 to
the pound and CDollars 1.357 to the US dollar.

The Malaysian bourse regulator announced new rules for share dealings,
barring brokers from imposing indiscriminate buying restrictions pending a
complete review of broker practices by year-end, agencies report from Kuala
Lumpur.
The Securities Commission chairman, Mr Munir Majid, said 10 new rules would
serve as 'minimum standards of business conduct for all securities
transactions. We want to put these minimum standards in place at least as a

Korea Electric Power (Kepco), the state-controlled electricity company,
reported net earnings for 1993 down 45 per cent to Won419bn (Dollars 347m),
but sales up 12 per cent to Won7,525bn, writes John Burton.
In spite of the earnings drop, Kepco had the largest profits among the
country's listed companies. It is also the biggest capitalised company on
the Seoul bourse.
Kepco blamed the lower profits on increased expenses, including power plant
construction, while electricity charges remained unchanged.

<TEXT>
International Paper's shares continued to fall in New York yesterday, a day
after the company told securities analysts that first-quarter results would
be below expectations.
The company, which benefited through much of 1993 from price increases in
its primary product line, uncoated sheet paper, is suffering from heavy
discounting this quarter, analysts said.
Wall Street had been projecting first-quarter earnings of about 75 cents per
share. Ms Evadna Lynn, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, said those
estimates were being adjusted to between 65 and 70 cents.
International Paper reported earnings of Dollars 100m, or 81 cents per
share, in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Its stock, which fell 4 per cent, or Dollars 2 3/4 , on Wednesday, was a
further Dollars 1 3/4 lower at Dollars 69 3/4 by midday yesterday.
Ms Lynn estimated that prices for uncoated printing papers have dropped
Dollars 40 per ton from the fourth-quarter highs, erasing about half the
price gains of the first three quarters.
Moreover, price increases for linerboard and corrugated boxes, scheduled for
this spring, would be difficult to implement quickly, she said.

Grumman, which agreed on Monday to a Dollars 1.9bn cash bid from fellow
defence contractor Martin Marietta, had only recently broken off months of
merger discussions with Northrop, the California-based fighter aircraft
manufacturer, it has emerged.
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that as
late as February 25 Northrop chief executive Mr Kent Kresa wrote to Grumman
saying it was prepared to submit a bid of not less than Dollars 50 a share,
if invited.
'We would also be prepared to consider an offer at a higher level, if
warranted, based on any additional information or analysis you may wish to
provide us,' the letter added.
However, on March 1 Grumman advised Northrop it was no longer interested in
pursuing talks and a week later agreed to a Dollars 55 a share cash offer
from Martin Marietta.
Northrop, in its negotiations, had said it preferred a transaction that
minimised the amount of cash involved.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Environmental, which has built a leading position in North American
industrial waste management in four years, reported 1993 net profit of
CDollars 19.7m (USDollars 14.5m), or 60 cents a share, up 8 per cent from
CDollars 18.3m, or 60 cents, on fewer shares in 1992.
Revenues jumped 61 per cent to CDollars 253m because of acquisitions.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 7.9m, or 23 cents a share, against
CDollars 5m, or 16 cents, on sales of CDollars 112m against CDollars 42m.
Philip, controlled by Toronto's Fracassi brothers and 10 per cent held by St
Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, has completed an
acquisition spree that doubled its asset base to CDollars 700m.
Philip went public in 1991 and swiftly bought up 20 companies in Canada for
nearly CDollars 300m. Late in 1993 a USDollars 120m financing enabled it to
buy two US recycling companies. Now 40 per cent of revenues come from the
US.
Philip is Canada's biggest recycler of commercial and industrial waste and a
leading US recycler of hazardous waste. It also operates an environmental
consulting business. It supplies waste oil to St Lawrence as a fuel for its
cement kilns.
Mr Alan Fracassi, president, said Philip was now consolidating and would
cope with its high debt level of about CDollars 300m. Revenues in 1994 are
expected to reach about CDollars 400m, and Philip's long-term ambition is to
become number three in North American waste management.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: US commercial banks feel the
chill of cost-cutting - Richard Waters examines the pressures which drove
Fleet Financial to implement a tough job reduction programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US financial services jungle, commercial banks that harbour excessive
costs are liable to get eaten. That fear yesterday drove Fleet Financial,
one of New England's biggest banks, to announce plans to slash its workforce
by 5,500 - more than a quarter of the total 21,000 - by the end of next
year.
Fleet's cost-cutting programme may be the most radical yet attempted, but it
echoes efforts already under way at other banks. Aware that they face little
income growth in the US, many have also turned to expense reduction as the
primary means of lifting earnings this year and next.
There is plenty to be done. At nearly 1.5m last year, the number of people
employed in Federally-insured banks in the US was only around 80,000 less
than a decade before, when employment hit its peak. The automation of
banking operations and mergers between banks since the mid-1980s were meant
to make the industry more efficient, but have had little apparent effect;
the average cost/income ratio at most banks last year was around 63 per
cent, similar to the mid-1980s.
Adding to the pressure is competition from a burgeoning array of non-bank
institutions. Operating costs at GE Capital - the financial arm of General
Electric and the institution eyed by most senior US bankers as their most
threatening non-bank competitor - stood at around 56 per cent of revenues
(after interest costs) last year.
Companies like GE have brought to the financial services industry a new
lost-cost attitude, honed in a tough industrial operating environment in the
1980s, says a senior executive at one of the large New York-based banks. As
a result, banks have lost ground to lower-cost producers in everything from
leasing to credit cards.
For Fleet, the pressure to cut costs is more pressing than most. Its
expenses stand at 66 per cent of income - a ratio that looks increasingly
out of line with the most efficient commercial banks. Citicorp, for
instance, has already dragged its costs down from 70 per cent to 56 per cent
of income, and has its eye set on the magical 50 per cent barrier.
The drastic moves announced yesterday mark a belated attempt by Fleet to
vault back into the ranks of the industry's most efficient institutions. By
the late-1980s, the Rhode Island-based bank had forced costs to below 60 per
cent of income, making it a leader among US banks. Its takeover of the
failed Bank of New England in 1991, though, pushed the ratio back up to 72
per cent. Subsequent cost-cutting has failed to bring it back
Adding to Fleet's sense of urgency now is the fact that it is top of many
banks's takeover lists. With New England recovering from a prolonged
economic slump, Fleet would be a prize for any bank seeking a foothold in
the prosperous north-east corner of the country. The bank's name has been
linked with the acquisitive North Carolina-based NationsBank, among others.
For its part, Fleet says that it would prefer a merger with a bank of
roughly equal size.
Time may be running out. On Wednesday, the House banking committee voted
overwhelmingly for an interstate banking bill that would eventually abolish
restrictions on banks branching across state lines or taking over
institutions in other states. The US Senate has already backed a similar
bill, making legislation this year probable.
These changes will make the takeover market more competitive. NationsBank,
for instance, is currently constrained by a banking compact which prevents
banks based in the south-east from making big acquisitions elsewhere in the
US. They will also reduce the costs of banks which operate in more than one
state, further ratcheting down the cost bases of the best and biggest in the
industry.
In apparent recognition of this, Fleet has made its own cost targets
steadily more ambitious. Last summer, when it first announced plans to cut
expenses, the bank said it was aiming for a cost/income ratio of 60 per cent
by the end of 1994. Yesterday, it set the target at 55 per cent by the end
of 1995, to be achieved by cutting costs by Dollars 300m and increasing
revenues by Dollars 50m.
If achieved, it will represent a rapid pay-back on the costs of the
restructuring. Last year, Fleet set aside Dollars 125m for the anticipated
costs, and yesterday added Dollars 25m to this.

<TEXT>
YPF, Argentina's leading oil and natural gas concern, has reported a surge
in profits for 1993, due mainly to improvements in downstream operations.
The net profit of Dollars 706m compared with Dollars 256m in 1992, with
sales totalling Dollars 3.96bn against Dollars 3.87bn.
The higher margins, spurred chiefly by investments in refining and
marketing, offset the fall in crude prices to about Dollars 15 per barrel
from Dollars 19 at the start of 1993.
Extraordinary charges were also sharply down last year, totalling Dollars
43m compared with Dollars 155m in 1992.
YPF said it would propose a Dollars 387m special dividend for the Argentine
government, which owns a 20.2 per cent stake in the company, as well as a
cash dividend of Dollars 282m for other shareholders.
The government sold most of its stock to private investors in an
international public offering last year.
YPF has set an upstream budget of Dollars 974m in 1994, up from Dollars 530m
last year. The company plans to spend Dollars 249m on downstream operations
in 1994 compared with 1993 levels of Dollars 117m.
It also intends to raise in 1994 crude production to 138m barrels, up from
107m in 1993.

<TEXT>
Trelleborg, the troubled Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday reported
a pre-tax loss of SKr1.52bn (Dollars 190m) in 1993, a slight improvement on
a loss of SKr1.56bn in 1992 which the group said presaged a return to profit
in 1994.
The company, which has been undergoing radical restructuring after being
badly hit by falling world metals prices, said its turnround programme of
cost cutting and disposals had significantly strengthened its financial
position.
Meanwhile, the weakness of the Swedish krona was giving a positive effect
after heavy foreign currency losses in 1992 and early-1993. If metal prices
did not worsen and an upward trend in its industrial operations continued,
the group would return to a 'positive result' this year, Trelleborg said.
Group sales in 1993 were SKr21.9bn, down from SKr23.6bn in 1992, while
operating losses rose to SKr326m from SKr186m in 1992.
But Trelleborg stressed it was reaping the benefits of restructuring
measures taken last year. It raised SKr1.3bn through the sale of Munksjo, a
paper and packaging company, and SKr900m from the sale of the group's stake
in Svedala, a materials handling company, taking proceeds from divestments
to more than SKr3.6bn over the year. It also raised SKr1.14bn in a rights
issue.
As a result, the balance sheet sank to SKr21.5bn from SKr25.7bn.

Spectrum Information Technologies and Mr John Sculley, the US company's

resignation.
No details were announced. In a joint statement, the mobile data
communications company and Mr Sculley, the former chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, said: 'Speculation created by the repetition of
charges and counter charges is not serving any useful purpose.'
Mr Sculley resigned after less than four months with the company. He sued
Spectrum's president, Mr Peter Caserta, charging that he had hidden the
company's financial and regulatory problems. Spectrum, currently under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, countered by suing
Sculley for breach of contract.

Falconbridge makes issue
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trelleborg, the Swedish metals group, is expected to cut substantially its
50 per cent interest in Falconbridge as part of a planned public share issue
by the Canadian base metals producer.
The size and terms of the issue are currently under discussion. However,
industry sources suggested that Falconbridge, which is at present owned
equally by Trelleborg and Noranda, the Canadian resources group, will seek
to raise at least CDollars 500m (USDollars 369m) in new equity.
Noranda said yesterday that it intended to maintain roughly its current
stake by subscribing for 45 to 50 per cent of the issue. But Trelleborg, in
a separate announcement, said that the two present shareholders' interest in
Falconbridge would drop to about 75 per cent.
Falconbridge is the western world's second biggest nickel producer, with six
nickel-copper mines near Sudbury, Ontario, a refinery in Norway, and a
ferro-nickel mining and metallurgical complex in the Dominican Republic. The
Kidd Creek zinc and copper complex in northern Ontario comprises another
large slice of Falconbridge's assets.
Falconbridge will use the proceeds of the public offering mainly to help
finance three large projects, namely, the Collahuasi copper property in
Chile, in which it has a one-third stake; the Raglan nickel-copper
development in northern Quebec; and the Nickel Rim project near Sudbury.
The company is also hoping to acquire another one-third stake in Collahuasi
presently held by the Royal Dutch Shell group. The remaining third is owned
by Minorco, the international resources arm of South Africa's Anglo American
group.
Noranda said that it would use existing financial resources and credit
facilities to finance its share of the proposed Falconbridge issue, and that
there would be no material increase in its debt burden.

<TEXT>
A prominent opposition figure in Malaysia says he will ask the government of
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, for a copy of a 1988 memorandum of
understanding signed by Dr Mahathir and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then UK
prime minister.
The document related to more than Pounds 1bn of British arms sales to
Malaysia.
Mr Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party, has been
the main force behind the setting up of a parliamentary panel to investigate
the arms sales.
'The all-party parliamentary committee on parliamentary honour and national
integrity will write to prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad for a copy of the
secret memorandum of understanding signed with Margaret Thatcher,' said Mr
Lim.
Mr Lim said the panel would also ask for a list of the local agents of the
various British companies involved in the arms sales following the signing
of the memorandum 'to ascertain whether there was any favouritism,
irregularity or hanky-panky involved'.
The Malaysian parliamentary committee has yet to meet and opposition MPs say
it is unlikely that parties that make up the governing national front
coalition will agree to being represented on the body.
In Britain the Labour party has alleged that the 1988 memorandum on defence
sales to Malaysia was linked to the granting of Pounds 234m of UK aid for
the Pergau dam project in Malaysia.
Such a linkage would be a breach of the government's own aid guidelines.
Two British parliamentary committees are investigating the affair.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Scottish assembly row brews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A political row was brewing at Westminster last night over government plans
to sell the building in Edinburgh which had been converted in the 1970s to
house the proposed Scottish assembly.
Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, used a Commons written answer to
announce that the government was offering the Old Royal High School for sale
to the City of Edinburgh District Council, its original owners.
Labour pounced on the decision saying that it showed the government's 'lack
of commitment to addressing the constitutional issue in Scotland.'
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'It will not divert us
from our clear intention to set up a Scottish parliament in an appropriate
building.'
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said the move was
widely seen as 'quite deliberately provocative' and 'part of a bid to
polarise Scottish opinion between the status quo and separatism.'
He said it was disingenuous of the government to offer the building to the
district council which had 'limited funds to buy anything'.
The government, which is offering the building at market value, acquired it
from the council in 1976 for Pounds 650,000.
The Pounds 3.75m adaptation and refurbishment was completed in 1978. In 1979
a devolution bill failed to clear the hurdle requiring 40 per cent of the
electorate to back it.

FT  22 FEB 94 / More use prepaid burial or cremation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past eight years about 100,000 people have arranged and paid for
their own funerals using the services of companies which arrange everything
from a choice of coffins to hymns, procession routes and headstone
inscriptions.
Once the fees are paid, prices are guaranteed until the services are needed.
The Office of Fair Trading investigation will look into an industry which
claims to offer 'peace of mind' to those who wish to plan for their funerals
in advance. The four main companies providing pre-paid funeral schemes -
market leader Chosen Heritage, Dignity, Golden Charter and CWS - offer a
variety of plans ranging from about Pounds 750 to more than Pounds 5,000,
though most customers pay between Pounds 850 and Pounds 1,200.
Through two voluntary regulatory bodies, the National Association of
Pre-paid Funeral Plans and the Funeral Planning Council, the companies
believe they already provide many of the safeguards the OFT is looking for.
Both regulatory organisations have drawn up codes of practice and demand
that members hold fees in independent trust funds with separate custodian
trustees.
Mr Graham Williams, of Chosen Heritage, which is recommended by the charity
Age Concern and claims 60 per cent of the pre-paid market, said: 'Once the
fee is paid it does not matter if the funeral takes place next year or in 20
years.'
Dignity, which claims to be second in the market - but will not release any
figures - offers four basic plans but allows customers to specify anything
they want. Dignity claims its fees are 'significantly less than the average
price of a funeral'.
CWS, the co-operative society, provides 25 per cent of all funeral services
and does not contract out any of its services to independent funeral
directors.
Mr Alan Edwards, operations manager of CWS, said: 'We are one of the very
few firms who do everything in-house.'
Life policies offered by insurance companies can cover some of the costs of
funerals, but payments are made in instalments rather than in a lump sum.
The full cost of a funeral is not always guaranteed, as premiums do not rise
with the prices of funerals.
Mr James Duffell of Norwich Union said that some customers might prefer life
assurance plans because they could pay in small monthly instalments.
He welcomed the OFT's investigation: 'Since we are both (life and funeral
service companies) targeting the same customers, regulation would put us on
a level playing field.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / ITC to revive Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday came out in favour of
re-advertising the franchise for Channel 5, provided the government
guarantees that the necessary frequencies will remain available over the
next few years.
The commission rejected the only bid for the franchise when it was initially
advertised in December 1992 and has been considering whether to re-advertise
or reserve the frequencies for the development of digital television
channels.
The commission's move was welcomed by the consortium consisting of MAI, the
controlling shareholder of Meridian Broadcasting, Time Warner, the world's
largest media group, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Thames
Television. The consortium has said it would bid if the television channel
were advertised.
The commission is seeking assurances from the government that it accepts a
Channel 5 service 'is not incompatible with a longer-term strategy for
digital terrestrial television'. It is understood that opinion within the
Department of Trade and Industry is divided on the issue.
Digital transmission would allow television signals to be compressed,
permitting the transmission of several channels in place of one. The
consortium said yesterday that it would be misconceived for the government
to block the availability of a new freely-available terrestrial channel
'whilst considering a technical system which is still some years from
introduction'.
However, Mr Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television and
chairman of the ITV engineering policy group, said the frequencies should be
used to create terrestrial digital television.
'While the ITC has a duty to consider the case for Channel 5, the government
needs to decide if the new developments in digital television should now
take priority'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rule change may push up funeral costs: Pollution law could
cost Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Funeral costs may rise sharply as owners of crematoria are faced with
spending up to Pounds 100m in the next few years to meet new environmental
rules, managers said yesterday.
Britain's 200 or more crematoria need to install new incinerators quickly to
meet the standards specified in the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. They
will also need to burn four to five times as much gas to reach the
temperatures specified by the new rules.
'That hardly makes sense if we're all trying to stop global warming,' said
Mr Mike Stride, general secretary of the Institute of Burial and Cremation
Administration, which represents managers of crematoria.
Crematoria, which are currently covered by the Clean Air Act, must comply
with the new rules by 1998. The rules are intended to eliminate emissions of
dioxins, hydrogen chloride and heavy metals, but managers of crematoria said
yesterday that the risk of such emissions was tiny.
'There are more pollutants from cars that come to the funeral than from the
crematorium,' said Mr Graeme Sloan, manager of the Lewisham Crematorium in
south London.
The complaints come against a background of criticism from many sectors of
industry that the act is too bureaucratic and adds to industrial costs
without achieving adequate environmental improvement.
Mr Tim Wood, superintendent and registrar of the West Hertfordshire
Crematorium near Watford, said: 'Under the new rules, I will have to
completely rebuild the crematoria, replace the four cremators with larger
ones, and add 10 feet to its 30-foot chimney'.
He said that improvements under the EPA - which he expects to cost Pounds
1.2m - are the main reason for the steep rise in fees for a cremation to
Pounds 165, up from Pounds 98 in 1991.
Mr Stride said: 'Most places are looking at spending half a million pounds -
this will probably cost the industry Pounds 100m, and that's before the
extra gas costs'.
A typical crematorium might see its gas bill rise from Pounds 4,000 a year
to Pounds 20,000. Mr Wood said that following the announcement of the
de-regulation of gas supplies, West Hertfordshire, which buys from British
Gas, is 'trying to find a gas company to supply us with a cheaper tariff'.
Some local authorities which cannot afford the investment 'are thinking of
selling up crematoria to the private sector or leasing them', said Mr
Stride.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Unions 'a force for change'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions are now 'a positive force for change' in making the UK industry
globally competitive, a senior union leader said last night.
But workers needed the legal right to workplace representation that their
counterparts in Germany and Japan have if industry was to achieve a new
partner-ship between capital and labour, said Mr Bill Jordan, president of
the AEEU, the country's largest manufacturing union.
'A legal right to representation at the place of work would be a giant step
towards eradicating the British disease instead of just suppressing the
symptoms as successive governments have done. Good legislation is a catalyst
for change,' Mr Jordan said in a speech in London.
He emphasised that this was 'not the same thing as a right to recognition
for unions'.
But if that caused non-union employers to look at the thinking and practice
of modern trade unionism, they 'would discover Britain's biggest industrial
world-class companies are overwhelmingly unionised'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / MP urges halt to work on pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Conservative MP yesterday urged the government to intervene to prevent
British Coal removing more equipment from a pit for which it is considering
rival bids by two companies.
Mr Peter Atkinson, MP for Hexham, is questioning why British Coal has
intensified what he described as 'scorched-earth activities' at Wearmouth
Colliery, Sunderland, while giving assurances that no equipment will leave
Ellington, Northumberland, while a private takeover remains possible.
Mr Atkinson accused British Coal of stripping Wearmouth of all essential
equipment before a decision was made on private bids.
The MP said bidders were concerned at the continuing removal of coal-cutting
equipment and hydraulic roof supports. Such new equipment can cost more than
Pounds 5m per face and may be hard to replace.
Mr Atkinson said British Coal on Friday ordered removal of the shearer and
supports from Wearmouth's second face, a move which would leave the pit with
no cutting equipment. He doubted that Longannet in Scotland, where both
Wearmouth shearers are being sent, needed so much equipment.
His comments coincided with confirmation that new cutting equipment was
delivered to Ellington and sent underground this month, barely 48 hours
before the closure announcement. 'Until a pit's closure is announced things
carry on as normal,' said British Coal yesterday.
Wearmouth bidders had been told what equipment would remain, it said. In
December, the corporation said it planned to remove equipment with a
written-down value of Pounds 8.3m from the pit.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Singer's contract defended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pop singer George Michael sued his record company in spite of achieving
everything possible in terms of fame, success and wealth, counsel for Sony
told the High Court yesterday.
Mr Gordon Pollock QC was making his closing submissions in Sony's defence to
the 30-year-old star's claim that his 1988 contract, which could run for
another 15 years, was a restraint of trade, financially weighted against him
and ultimately unenforceable.
Mr Pollock said that in previous litigation over restraint of trade, the
court would act in the public interest if its moral sense was outraged by
harrowing pictures of a party to a contract starving in the gutter while
society was deprived of his services.
But Mr Michael was a young man desperate for a contract by which to achieve
success, fame and fortune.
'We have a situation here where the person complaining has been wholly
successful in achieving the exploitation of his talent which it was the
purpose of the contract to achieve,' he said.
'At the same time we have not been deprived of the benefit of his talent.'
Mr Michael has claimed that Sony 'killed' Listen Without Prejudice, the 1990
follow-up to his 1988 debut solo album, Faith, to teach him a lesson when he
refused - as part of a change of artistic direction - to market it with a
video featuring himself.
After Mr Pollock's speech, which is expected to last all week, and
submissions from Mr Michael's counsel, the judge will reserve his decision.
The hearing was adjourned.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Labour steps up its protest over clearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party is pushing ahead with its campaign to reduce delays in
cheque clearing by Britain's banks and building societies amid growing
concern about the way in which retail customers are being treated.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer minister, yesterday said building
societies had been making up to Pounds 300m a year by delaying the clearing
of cheques and investing the cash overnight in the wholesale money markets.
He said that the societies were taking up to 10 days to clear a cheque when
it should take two days to do this and deduct the money from the signatory's
account. He called for an end to the practice, which he said costs customers
tens of millions of pounds a year.
Since Labour stepped up its campaign, two high street banks - Midland and
National Westminster - have announced that they will shorten their clearing
cycle for cheques to two days. Barclays Bank has a long-standing policy of
paying interest on retail deposits three days after they are made.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
said that there was a difference between the amount of time taken by
societies to clear cheques and the point at which they began paying interest
to customers on those cheques.
If societies were making a profit on those transactions, he said, 'then that
means that the interest rate they are able to pay savers is higher than it
otherwise would be'.
Mr Griffiths is also angered by a poll showing that a growing number of
customers are concerned about the way they are treated in general by the
banks.
The poll, conducted by the Independent Banking Advisory Service, found that
the practices of high street banks led to marriage break-ups, family rows
and insecurity.
The service questioned 1,860 people who contacted it during a four-month
period and found that one in three - 34 per cent - said they were left
desperate or depressed by problems with their banks, while 14 per cent said
they had been driven to the brink of suicide.
'This report makes me wonder whether banks did not treat their customers
better in the 1890s than they they do in the 1990s,' said Mr Griffiths.
The picture painted by the survey's findings was vigorously disputed by the
banking industry.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Prescott in row on private finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour leftwingers yesterday accused Mr John Prescott, shadow employment
secretary, of 'bouncing' the party into accepting plans for sympathetic
treatment of private financing for infrastructure projects.
The row follows the weekend release of a discussion paper on investment
which leftwingers fear may lead to a scaling down of government projects
funded by tax and borrowing. 'This was never discussed,' said one leftwing
member of the shadow cabinet. 'This is a major initiative, and I am very
worried about both the substance and the presentation. We have been
bounced.'
The document was co-authored by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, for a symposium on
infrastructure investment later this week. Mr Brown told BBC Radio from
Geneva: 'It is the duty of a Labour chancellor to look at how we can use the
resources we have to best effect.'
The document, however, is widely believed to have been prompted by Mr
Prescott, who has been pressing the case for greater use of private funds in
infrastructure projects for several years.
There was some dismay among leftwingers about the involvement of Mr
Prescott, whose roots are on the left of the party. Mr Prescott said the
shadow cabinet and Labour's national executive committee had been kept
informed of discussions on the document 'at every stage'.
Mr Prescott blamed the row on inaccurate briefings to newspapers by unnamed
Labour 'spin doctors' who had not read the document. 'It is not very
helpful, frankly,' he said. 'This is a document about accountancy, not
socialism. There is no reason why there should be a problem.'
The document says there is scope for much greater use of private finance in
the provision of transport infrastructure, inner-city redevelopment,
training, housing, childcare and defence diversification. It also suggests a
limited application in the provision of publicly led projects in education
and health.
The document calls for 'imaginative' financing solutions, such as
transferral of development benefits and regulatory changes in return for
investment. Ideas include:
Clearer rules on risk division, project-approval procedures and intellectual
property rights.
Redefinition of the public sector borrowing requirement to exclude
government-owned trading companies.
Relaxation of Treasury controls on jointly financed projects to take account
of social benefits.
A cut in the required rate of return, now 8 per cent, to between 6.5 per
cent and 7.5 per cent, the average real return on private non-oil assets.
Assessment rules giving priority to job-creating projects.
A task force to resolve problems, and an 'investment broker' to investigate
proposals, leaving the government to decide on priorities.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the document
amounted to a disguised attempt to embrace the government's private finance
initiative of 1992.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Electricity bills face rise from nuclear levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity bills, which already face the imposition of value added tax,
could also be hit by a rise in the nuclear levy to offset the recent
price-capping agreement in the power generation industry.
The levy, now 11 per cent, provides more than Pounds 1bn a year of the money
needed by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear utility, to cover the
cost of decommissioning ageing plant. A small proportion of it also goes to
finance renewable forms of energy such as wind farms.
The price-capping agreement by National Power and PowerGen will reduce
electricity bills and also, therefore, the yield from the levy. This means
that it will have to be raised if it is to reach its target of Pounds 8.5bn
by 1998, when it is due to be phased out.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator who arranged the
price-capping agreement and sets the levy, recently announced that it would
fall from 11 per cent to 10 per cent next April. He was thought to be
responding to government pressure to offset the introduction of VAT on home
heating.
But the levy is already several hundred million pounds below target, and the
combination of the cut and price-capping means it will almost certainly have
to be raised quite sharply to get it back on course.
Dr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, yesterday accused Prof
Littlechild of granting the generators 'a licence to collude' by sanctioning
the price-capping arrangement, which Offer, the electricity regulator, says
could lead to a 7 per cent cut in wholesale electricity prices.
Nuclear Electric stands to lose more than Pounds 200m a year from the
agreement because it sells most of its output in the wholesale market. This
is on top of whatever it loses from the reduction in the levy.
Dr Hawley said that National Power and PowerGen agreed to price-capping only
because their profits were protected by long-term contracts to sell
electricity to the retail market.
Delay in reaching the price-capping agreement - originally due by the end of
last year - has also forced the government to reconsider the timing of its
sale of the residual 40 per cent shareholding in National Power and
PowerGen. Originally set for next autumn, the Pounds 4bn sale is now likely
to be postponed to February 1995.
However, provided the government can complete the sale by the end of March
1995, the revenues will still enable it to achieve its target of Pounds
5.5bn privatisation receipts in the next financial year.

FT  22 FEB 94 / University cuts first-year intake
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The University of East Anglia will cut its intake of first-year students by
8 per cent this year because of cuts in government funding.
The university said the cut was 'much greater than had been expected', and
that there were 65,000 more students in the English university system in
October 1993 than the Treasury had expected to pay for.
Figures on next year's grants for each university will be announced next
week by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Both the funding
council and the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals suggested that
East Anglia's cut might prove exceptional, and predicted an average
reduction closer to 3 per cent.

FT  22 FEB 94 / MP urges review of competition policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Conservative MP has criticised the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in calling for a comprehensive review of competition policy.
Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, yesterday used a
Westminster meeting to urge a 'thorough investigation into the British
process for regulating competition'.
'There was a time when the great and the good could be relied on to
interpret the public interest according to a widely-held consensus view,' Mr
Watts said, arguing that recent MMC reports 'clearly demonstrate that this
is not the case today'.
Mr Watts, MP for Slough, was supported by Mr Stephen Locke, director of the
Consumers' Association policy unit, who said there was 'considerable
duplication of activity' by the MMC, the Office of Fair Trading and the

FT  22 FEB 94 / Hanging rejected by larger majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs rejected a demand for the return of hanging for all murderers aged over
18 by a large majority of 244 (403-159) in a free vote in the Commons last
night, Ivor Owen writes.
It was the biggest setback suffered by the pro-hanging lobby since capital
punishment was abolished in 1965, and in effect removes the issue from the
political agenda at Westminster.
An attempt to amend the criminal justice and public order bill to provide
for the reintroduction of hanging for all murders of police officers was
defeated by a majority of 197 (383-186).
The votes followed a blunt warning by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
that miscarriages of justice could result in innocent parties being hanged.
In a mainly low-key debate, advocates of the restoration of capital
punishment highlighted the growing number of elderly people being murdered
in their own homes.
They also cited the rise in the number of police officers killed while
investigating robberies and other crimes.
Mr Howard, who had consistently voted for the return of the death penalty
until 1990, described how the overturning of the convictions for terrorist
pub-bombings of the so-called 'Birmingham six' had changed his mind.
Acknowledging support among the police for the view that criminals were now
more ready to use firearms in pursuit of crime, he reaffirmed his acceptance
of the need for a strong deterrent for the murder of police officers.
Mr Howard stressed: 'Those responsible serve as a minimum 20 years in
prison. Many will serve much longer than that.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Employers criticise Tecs as inflexible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than one-in-four employers find training and enterprise councils in
England and Wales and local enterprise councils in Scotland inflexible, says
one of the first large-scale surveys of business attitudes to the
employer-led bodies.
It also found that one in five criticised the relevance of the help the
councils gave.
The survey of 234 employers - with a combined workforce of nearly 500,000 -
found a significant mismatch between what employers believed Tecs and Lecs
should be doing and what employers thought they actually were doing.
For example, local economic development was given the highest priority by
employers - 33.8 per cent gave it top priority - but only 7 per cent
believed that Tecs and Lecs put this at the top of their agenda.
However, the Tecs (which deliver government training schemes) and Lecs
(which have a wider economic development role) will find some encouragement
in the survey by employment analysts Industrial Relations Services. It
reported that 87.2 per cent of companies use the councils' services.
An Industrial Society report in May 1991 found that less than half of
companies had such contact. But the IRS survey is biased towards larger
organisations and 23 per cent of respondents were represented on the local
Tec or Lec.
Those companies that did have contact tended to come more from manufacturing
than services, with financial services particularly under-represented.
Companies gave four main reasons for contact, all of them connected with
government-inspired initiatives: Investors in People, National and Scottish
Vocational Qualifications, training courses and Youth Training.
Less encouraging for Tecs and Lecs was that only one-third of respondents
who contacted the organisations said they did so about issues of central
importance to them.
Smaller companies generally reported more satisfaction than larger ones,
although between 65 per cent and 88 per cent - depending on the issue in
question - were either satisfied or very satisfied.
The biggest complaint from larger companies in particular was 'civil service
attitudes'. Most organisations that spanned several Tecs or Lecs complained
of problems and one national organisation said that the only way it could
deal with the Tec was to employ one person full-time.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Sports Council complaints backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A top Whitehall official acknowledged yesterday that there had been
justifiable complaints about recent financial management and practices at
the Sports Council, the government body charged with promoting sporting
activity in the UK.
Mr Hayden Phillips, permanent secretary at the Department of National
Heritage, told MPs that the Sports Council had not established a proper
'arms-length relationship' with a subsidiary trust company that it had set
up in 1990.
He also accepted a claim from the National Audit Office, the government's
accountancy watchdog, that 'potential conflicts of interest' had been
created by the award of a tender to a company whose chairman and principal
shareholder was the Sports Council's finance director.
Mr Phillips, whose department administers the Sports Council's affairs, was
giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, the committee of backbench
MPs which examines how public money is spent.
Yesterday's enquiry was given no evidence of financial impropriety. However,
the complexity of the council's arrangements was frequently criticised by
PAC members. Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea, said 'it would be hard
to think of a way of organising financial arrangements more likely to arise
suspicion.'
Mr Phillips said that there was some merit to claims that there had not been
full transparency of cashflows between the council and a trust company which
it had set up in 1990. 'The potential conflicts of interest in the
relationship between the trust company and the council did cause real
concern,' he told MPs. The main decisions had preceded the setting up of the
department in 1992.
'I quite accept that the sort of arrangement whereby the same person appears
in different capacities is one which should be avoided,' he said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Tory peers reject clause on police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday suffered a further embarrassing setback in the
House of Lords at the hands of Conservative backbench critics of the police
and magistrates courts bill.
Peers voted 107 to 100 to reject plans to speed up police disciplinary
procedures after Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister of state, ignored
Tory calls to back down.
The defeat is the first since the bill entered its committee stage last
week. However, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has also backed down twice
to avoid a vote.
Peers from all parties supported the amendment, moved by Lord Bethell, a
Conservative adviser to the Police Federation, who said there was 'deep
concern' among police officers about the bill.
The bill would have removed from the statute book provisions guaranteeing
legal representation to police officers accused of disciplinary offences.
Backbench peers said the proposals would place police officers in danger of
double jeopardy - being tried twice for the same offence.
The government faces further trouble today when the Lords debates provisions
intended to streamline the judicial system by improving the administration
of magistrates courts.
Conservative backbenchers have tabled a series of amendments opposing
government plans to reform the duties of magistrates' clerks and to
introduce fixed-term contracts.
The proposals were strongly opposed by Tory peers during the second-reading
debate. However, in spite of growing backbench unrest, the government has
pressed ahead.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Homosexual age of consent lowered to 18
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The age of consent for sex between homosexuals is to be lowered to 18 after
the Commons last night rejected a common age of consent for homosexuals and
heterosexuals at 16 and voted for the compromise favoured by Mr Major.
Mrs Edwina Currie, Conservative MP for Derbyshire South, whose clause to the
criminal justice bill advocating a common age of consent was defeated by 307
votes to 280, pledged to continue the fight for equality.
And she warned that the UK was likely to be forced to change the law by the
European Court of Human Rights if the Commons delayed the matter much
longer.
Although two cabinet ministers were among 42 Conservatives voting for a
common age of consent, a number of prominent Labour members ensured the
reform was defeated. An overwhelming majority of 265 voted to reduce the age
of consent for gay sex from 21 to 18.
Mr Jerry Hayes, a Conservative co-sponsor of Mrs Currie's clause, said: 'It
does not say a lot for tolerance and equality.'
Rightwing Tories said they would vote against any change at third reading.
During the debate Mrs Currie was frequently interrupted from her own side.
She was accused by Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North) of 'voting to
legislate buggery of adolescent men'. While Mr Bill Walker (Tayside North)
argued that homosexuality was 'neither natural nor normal'.
But Mrs Currie said a law which allowed heterosexuals to marry at 16 but
judged homosexuals to be different was 'nuts', adding: 'There is no logical
argument for discrimination and there is no biological one either.'
Sir Anthony Durant (Reading West) put forward an amendment proposing 18 as
the age of consent for gay sex, which was backed by the prime minister and
his cabinet.
He argued that most 16-year-olds were 'very confused about their sexuality'.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, made an impassioned plea to lower
the age of consent for homosexuals, arguing that in some cases it was
important for the House of Commons to be a step ahead of public opinion.
After the vote homosexual rights activists attempted to storm the entrance
to parliament but the doors were locked.

FT  22 FEB 94 / South Wales Police Authority fails to resolve financial
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Wales Police Authority yesterday failed to resolve a financial
crisis that threatens to shut as many as 60 police stations. After a heated
discussion behind closed doors, the authority rejected as 'totally
unacceptable' Chief Constable Robert Lawrence's closure plans.
Instead, it ordered a review of its finances in an attempt to find other
ways of offsetting a deficit of nearly Pounds 2m before the next financial
year - just six weeks away.
A budget review team will meet on Friday to examine possibilities such as
switching some functions, such as the traffic warden service, to the control
of county councils.
More than 3,000 police officers, represented by the Police Federation,
passed a vote of no confidence in the authority.
The local government union Unison, representing 800 of the 1,300 civilian
staff, supported the move, claiming south Wales had been made to look 'a
laughing stock' and warned that the force was in danger of losing its
official certificate of efficiency.
After the meeting in Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, Mr Roy Jones, authority
chairman and county councillor, said the budget review group would attempt
to draw up an alter-native to police station closures.
As well as closing police stations, the chief constable's report included
the option of selling police cars and cutting spending on uniforms.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commons majority against hanging grows
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs rejected a demand for the return of hanging for all murderers aged over
18 by a massive 244 majority (403-159)in a free vote in the Commons last
night.
It was the biggest setback suffered by the pro-hanging lobby since capital
punishment was abolished in 1965, and in effect removes the issue from the

An attempt to amend the criminal justice and public order bill to provide

In a mainly low-key debate, advocates of the restoration of capital
punishment highlighted the growing number of elderly people being murdered

They also cited the rise in the number of police officers killed while
investigating robberies and other crimes as further evidence that life
imprisonment was not an effective deterrent to murder.
Mr Howard, who had consistently voted for the return of the death penalty
until 1990, described how the overturning of the convictions for terrorist
pub-bombings of the so-called 'Birmingham six' had changed his mind.
He also quoted the case of Mr Stephan Kiszko, convicted when he confessed to
the murder of a schoolgirl and released after 15 years imprisonment when
forensic tests proved he could not have been her killer.
Mr Howard said miscarriages of justice were a 'blot on civilised society'.
He endorsed the view of Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the lord chief justice,
that it would be wrong for MPs to seek to require the judges of the court of
appeal to decide which types of murder should be punished by the death
penalty.
Mr Howard said 'I do not think it is right for parliament to hand over to
others this responsibility. The decision must be ours to take.'
Acknowledging that support among the police for the view that criminals were
now more ready to use firearms in pursuit of crime, he reaffirmed his
acceptance of the need for a strong deterrent for the murder of police
officers.
He stressed: 'Those responsible serve as a minimum 20 years in prison. Many
will serve much longer than that. Some will remain in prison for the rest of
their lives.'
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, agreed with Mr Howard that the most
powerful argument against restoration of the death penalty was the risk
'that we kill the innocent through a miscarriage of justice'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Merrett may set up outside Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Merrett Group confirmed yesterday that it could set up a new
underwriting business outside of the Lloyd's market, following its
withdrawal last year from the active management of Lloyd's syndicates.
The group, which is chaired by Mr Stephen Merrett, the former deputy
chairman of Lloyd's, transferred management of its syndicates to rival
agents after losing the backing of Names, the individuals whose assets
support the market.
It subsequently restructured its activities around its loss-adjusting and
insurance services companies and is conducting a sizeable 'run off' business
 -administering the payment of claims on business underwritten by its
syndicates in previous years.
Merrett said yesterday: 'The group has been considering various
opportunities . . . However, while the strategy is firm, the structure and
constitution of any new Merrett-linked insurance vehicle remain under
discussion.'
Meanwhile, 39 Names who were members of syndicates managed by the Oakeley
Vaughan agency have dropped their legal action against the corporation of
Lloyd's, the body which regulates and administers the market. After a
six-year legal battle, the Names face a heavy legal bill, with costs
estimated at about Pounds 1m, or an average of Pounds 26,000 a Name.
The Names alleged that supervisory failures by Lloyd's were responsible for
their insurance losses of more than Pounds 6m incurred in the early 1980s.
They had been due in court on February 28 to attempt to prove that they were
owed a legal duty of care by Lloyd's.

Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Commons speaker, yesterday rebuked a group based
in India which has urged a boycott of goods manufactured in the
constituencies of 16 British MPs.
She told the Commons in a statement the call was an 'undoubted contempt of
the House' and it would be a 'a serious offence' for anyone to carry out the
boycott.
The boycott threat appeared to be targeted against people in Britain who
have campaigned against human rights abuses in India.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas of the US is expected to select the joint aero-engine
venture between the German car maker BMW and the UK aero-engine group
Rolls-Royce to supply the power plant for its new MD-95 100-seater airliner.
Mr Richard Turner, Rolls-Royce's group marketing director, yesterday said at
a Financial Times Asia Aerospace Conference in Singapore that 'detailed
discussions' with the US manufacturer were under way to supply a more
powerful version of the BR-700 engine being developed by BMW Rolls-Royce for
the new MA-95 twin-engine aircraft.
The decision is a setback for Deutsche Aerospace, whose MTU engine
subsidiary in partnership with General Electric and Pratt  Whitney of the
US and Snecma of France, are proposing to develop a rival engine to the
BR-700.
BMW Rolls-Royce is also proposing the BR-700 to re-engine older McDonnell
Douglas DC-9 twin-engine airliners. It has already been chosen by Gulf
Stream of the US to power its GV, the business jet, and by Canadair for its
Global Express long-range corporate jet. But the proposed deals with
McDonnell Douglas would enable the Anglo-German venture to break into the
much bigger regional jet airliner market.
Mr Turner said the first full BR-700 engine would start testing later this
year, although the engine core had already run successfully.
Mr Robert Hood, president of the Douglas Aircraft Company, said the US
company would soon start marketing to potential airline customers the MD-95,
a derivative of the company's 130-seat MD-90 and the larger MD-80. All these
twin-engine airliners are derivatives of the older DC-9s.
Aircraft makers expect the market for 100-seater regional jets to show
strong growth in the next 15 years.
Saudi Arabia's decision to award a Dollars 6bn contract for commercial jets
to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas will cost the European aerospace industry up
to 20,000 jobs, Mr Jean Pierson, managing director of the Airbus consortium,
said in Singapore yesterday.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Poland eager to settle UK air dispute -
Warsaw wants London flight row resolved for summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland is seeking a quick end to the long-running dispute between British
Airways and Lot, the Polish state-owned airline, which has blocked all
direct flights between Poland and the UK since October 30.
'We've lost the winter, that was clear when we failed to get a deal by
Christmas to catch the seasonal traffic, but we now want to resolve the
dispute in time for the summer season starting in April,' says Mr Boguslaw
Liberadzki, the Polish transport minister.
The dispute arose out of the Polish government's refusal to allow British
Airways to double its flights to Warsaw from seven to 14 a week. BA wanted
to introduce an afternoon flight from London which would return from Warsaw
in time for transit passengers to transfer onto flights to North American
and other destinations. Lot feared that this would cream off passengers from
its own transatlantic flights serving the large Polish communities in
Chicago and other cities.
The two airlines, backed by their respective government agencies, have
ignored the protests of thousands of business and other passengers who have
been obliged by the dispute to change aircraft at other north European
airports, doubling travel time between the two countries.
Mr Liberadzki says he reached an 'understanding' with Lord Caithness, the UK
minister who was dealing with the matter until he left the government
earlier this year. 'Both sides agreed they should emerge from the clash
without losing face with the number of flights by both carriers gradually
increasing to 14 a week over three years,' he said. The UK minister now
responsible for resolving the dispute is Lord McKay of Ardbrecknish.
The dispute between BA, which last week announced a threefold increase in
profits to Pounds 65m for the third quarter of 1993, and Lot, which is being
prepared for privatisation, reflects a tough battle by international
airlines for a share in the fast-growing east European travel market.
BA, whose proposed Air Russia joint venture is currently holding fire, has
discarded all previous pooling arrangements with east European airlines,
with the exception of Aeroflot, and has held aloof from the kind of tie-ups
with east European airlines which led Air France to take a stake in CSA, the
Czech airline, and Alitalia to buy a stake in Malev of Hungary.
Instead BA opted to double its flights into Prague, Budapest and Warsaw. It
obtained agreement from the Czech and Hungarian authorities, increasing the
competitive pressure on CSA and Malev and helping to fill seats on its
owntransatlantic and other flights with transit passengers from central
Europe. BA's hopes to achieve the same results in Poland, however, came up
against stiff resistance.
Morale at Lot has improved in recent months and so has profitability. The
company yesterday reported a Zl 62.9bn (Dollars 3.4m) profit for 1993 after
a Zl 84.1bn loss in 1992. It has managed to sell all its old Soviet aircraft
and now runs an all-western fleet of three Boeing 767s, eight 737s and five
Italo-French ATR 72s, leaving it with total debt of around Dollars 1bn.

the environment are starting to gather momentum after a slow start. Further
impetus may come from a special session today of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade's governing council to discuss the matter.
Though ministers are due to approve the work programme in Marrakesh in
April, governments appear to have only a vague notion of what should go into
it.
The 118 nations taking part in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks
agreed in December that a comprehensive work programme on trade, environment
and sustainable development should be put to ministers when they meet to
sign the final package of trade-liberalising accords.
Informal consultations since then suggest broad agreement on the need to set
up a committee to carry out the work. However, its mandate, and lifespan,
remain controversial.
No one disputes the need for Gatt, and its successor, the World Trade
Organisation, to confront the way in which trade and environment policies
interact and may conflict. There is nevertheless a wide gulf between the
views of environmentalists, who favour changing Gatt rules to facilitate the
use of trade restrictions for environmental protection, and those of
developing countries who fear that moves to 'green the Gatt' may spread a
virulent new form of protectionism.
There has thus been strong resistance among developing countries to
presenting the Marrakesh meeting with a fixed agenda which is bound, they
believe, to reflect rich-world concerns. Instead, they want the Marrakesh
declaration to confine itself to approving the principles guiding the
committee's work and for the committee to decide its own agenda in its own
time.
'Creating a committee on trade and the environment will already be a big
step,' says one influential developing country Gatt ambassador. 'I don't
think we should try to prejudge what the committee should discuss.'
The principles underlying the work programme were outlined by Uruguay Round
participants in a statement last December. They include the need to promote
sustainable development, preserve the open trading system and avoid
unilateralism while ensuring the responsiveness of the trading system to
environmental objectives.
'There should not be, nor need be, any policy contradiction between
upholding and safeguarding an open, non-discriminatory and equitable
multilateral trading system on the one hand, and acting for the protection
of the environment, and the promotion of sustainable development on the
other,' the statement says.
Environmental groups, for their part, fear that leaving the committee to
devise its own work programme will be a recipe for delay and issue-dodging.
More than 40 groups from around the world last week backed proposals calling
for an 'action-oriented' agenda aimed at reaching recommendations within two
years.
Conscious of the sensitivities of developing countries, the proposals stress
support for sustainable development and down-play the role of trade
restrictions. At the same time, however, the Gatt/WTO is urged to address
the two issues which most raise third world hackles.
The first relates to so-called processing and production methods (PPMs).
Environmentalists want Gatt rules changed to allow discrimination between
identical products produced in different ways. This would, for instance,
validate US trade curbs, now judged Gatt-illegal, which ban imports of tuna
caught in ways which kill too many dolphins.
The second concerns 'eco-dumping' - the competitive advantage allegedly
gained by countries with low environmental standards. Mr Charles
Arden-Clarke of the WWF-World Wide Fund for Nature insists that there is no
intention to oblige poor countries to adopt the high environmental standards
of rich ones.
Rather, he says, the issue turns on the more general need to make product
prices reflect full environmental costs. But the suspicion remains that in
practice 'eco-dumping' will serve as a new pretext for protectionism aimed
primarily at poor countries.
Other agenda ideas are less controversial. For the last two years, a Gatt
working group chaired by Mr Hidetoshi Ukawa of Japan has been discussing the
relationship of Gatt rules with the trade provisions of multilateral
environmental agreements, the need for transparency in trade and
environmental policies, and the vexed question of eco-labelling and its
impact on trade.
While the group did not seek to reach conclusions, the ground has been well
worked over. These areas are likely to be priority items for the new
committee even if they do not appear specifically in the work programme
approved in Marrakesh.
The US, despite its high-profile campaign for early Gatt talks on trade and
the environment, has no plans to draft its own agenda proposals. Mr Timothy
Wirth, environment adviser to the US secretary of state, said recently the
main US priority was creating a permanent committee to examine the
trade/environment link.
Washington and like-minded European governments may thus prefer to play safe
and see the committee safely established in Marrakesh before the real
haggling begins.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japanese airline applies to slash fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A price war broke out yesterday in the Japanese airline industry when All
Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest airline by turnover, asked the
Japanese Ministry of Transport to allow it to slash international economy
fares by up to 55 per cent.
The move followed a request earlier this month from Japan Air Lines, ANA's
main rival, to cut fares to the US and Honolulu by up to 50 per cent.
ANA said it wanted to reduce its economy fares to Europe by an average of 41
per cent, although the maximum cut would be as great as 55 per cent. It also
wanted to offer a 44 per cent reduction for the standard fare to the US east
coast. JAL said it was looking to cut fares to Asia and Europe, but had not
yet decided by how much.
The ministry has the right to set maximum and minimum fares. The new
tariffs, if approved, would be available from April 1.
The moves represent urgent attempts by both Japanese airlines to boost their
passenger loads. They are suffering from poor demand, caused by Japan's
worst recession since the second world war, fierce competition from other
airlines, and high cost bases.
International routes have suffered particularly badly. ANA's international
loading factor - the proportion of available seats filled - fell from 69.7
per cent during the 1992 financial year to 63.2 per cent during the six
months to last September. Meanwhile JAL's international loading factor fell
from 70.9 per cent during the six months to September 1992 to 66.6 per cent
for the same period last year.
Meanwhile, ANA said it was suspending its joint flights with Sabena, the
Belgian airline, between Brussels and Tokyo's Narita airport. It also
revealed plans to set up routes from the new airport at Kansai to Shanghai,
Beijing, Dalian and Tsingtao in China, as well as Seoul. The company said it
aimed to set up an Asian hub at the airport, due to be opened in September.
ANA forecast it would increase the number of international passengers
carried during the 1994 fiscal year by 6 per cent to 1.6m.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Mexico economic growth at seven-year low: Government blames
restructuring of country's private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Mexico's economy grew 0.4 per cent last year, the lowest rate for seven
years, and far short of the November government forecast of 1.1 per cent,
government statistics show.
For the first time in the administration of President Carlos Salinas,
economic growth has been outstripped by population growth.
The manufacturing sector shrank by 1.5 per cent from 1992, with the textile
industry declining by 7.4 per cent, printing and publishing by 6.4 per cent,
and timber by 10.1 per cent. The service and agricultural sectors grew by
0.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.
The government has blamed the low overall growth and recession in
manufacturing on the restructuring of Mexico's private sector, as companies
closed or reduced operations to compete under free trade.
However Mexico's strong exchange rate and high real interest rates and the
government budget surplus have made the process of restructuring deeper and
more costly than had been forecast.
The 0.4 per cent growth for the year would imply a growth of 0.15 per cent
for the fourth quarter, suggesting that the economy has recovered from the
third quarter, when it contracted by 1.1 per cent.
The government also announced that Mexico's trade deficit fell to Dollars
13.6bn (Pounds 9.3bn) in 1993, a 15.1 per cent reduction on the previous
year. The low economic growth helped slow growth in imports to 5.2 per cent,
to reach Dollars 65.4bn in total. Imports of capital goods fell by 4.7 per
cent, an indication of the difficulties faced by the private sector last
year.
Mexico's exports reached Dollars 51.8bn last year, an increase of 12.2 per
cent. Manufacturing exports, which account for about half the total,
increased by 17.7 per cent.

<TEXT>
The Mexican government and delegates from the rebel Zapatista Army of
National Liberation opened peace talks yesterday in the hope of ending the
nearly two-month conflict in the southern state of Chiapas, Damian Fraser
reports from San Cristobal de las Casas.
The two sides appeared together after the opening session and said they
would meet today to continue to discuss the agenda of negotiations.
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, acting as mediator, said there had been 'sincerity' and
'mutual respect' in the talks.
The Zapatistas seemed to be led by so-called Sub-Commander Marcos, with 17
other delegates.
The government side was represented by Mr Manuel Camacho, peace envoy of
President Carlos Salinas. For the first time he explicitly recognised the
guerrillas as the Zapatista Army of Naional Liberation, and called them a
fully Mexican and predominantly Indian movement.
The two sides at the begining of the talks appeared divided on a number of
issues. Mr Camacho insisted in a communique on Sunday that negotiations
exclude national issues, contrary to the apparent aspirations of the rebels.
However, Mr Camacho left some room for negotiation, saying that 'certainly
there will be a discussion on national issues and we also know that the
solutions to some local problems have national implications.'
With many towns in southern Chiapas divided between Zapatistas and
supporters of the government, the rebel demand for political autonomy for
Indians in Chiapas is likely to meet resistance.
Rich landowners, and some of the estimated 20,000 mainly Indian people who
have fled their homes since the New Year uprising, partly in fear of
Zapatistas, are likely to oppose autonomy that gives political power to
rebel leaders.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Drug cuts transfer of HIV virus to babies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the British pharmaceutical company, said yesterday that a new
study found that its drug AZT cut by two-thirds the transmission of the HIV
virus from pregnant mothers to their babies, Reuter reports from New York
and London.
The transmission rate was 8.3 per cent when mothers and babies both received
AZT, marketed by Wellcome as Retrovir. The rate was 25.5 per cent among
mothers and babies receiving placebos.
Wellcome said the US study had been halted and investigators were now
offering Retrovir to all pregnant women and babies who were participating in
the study.
The company plans to submit a package to the US Food and Drug Administration
this week seeking approval for the use of the drug in reducing
mother-to-baby transmission. It will also pass the data on to regulators in
other countries.
Each year in the US an estimated 7,000 women infected with HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) give birth. About 25 per cent of their babies are
infected with the virus.
The study was sponsored by the US National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, in collaboration with the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development and Institut National de la Sante et de la
Recherche Medicale of France.
Wellcome said investigators found that both mothers and babies tolerated the
drug well, with no significant short-term side effects apart from reversible
mild anaemia in some infants.
Dr Harold Jaffe, an epidemiologist and HIV specialist at the US government's
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, told the New York
Times the study was 'the first indication that mother-to-child transmission
of HIV can be at least decreased, if not prevented'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Trying hard but could do better, says World Bank: Report for
the 1990s calls for overhaul of the legal system and significant reforms in
other areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For nearly a decade Mexico has been the model pupil of the World Bank,
following its advice on economic policy and receiving in return subsidised
loans of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year, more than granted to any other
middle-income country.
The bank played a crucial part in Mexico's decision to join Gatt in 1986,
the restructuring of its external debt in 1989, and the redesign of
environmental policy two years ago. Bank economists were powerful and
successful advocates of the liberalisation of Mexico's agriculture sector.
The bank has now prepared a restricted circulation report on the economic
challenges Mexico faces in the 1990s. While largely praising economic policy
to date, the bank calls for a sweeping overhaul of Mexico's legal system and
important reforms in the labour and financial sectors, environmental policy,
and provision of public infrastructure.
The bank is worried about Mexico's slow economic growth and low savings
rate, which it believes makes its economy over-dependent on foreign capital.
It concludes that the high current account deficit and modest improvements
in productivity 'raise concern about the sustainability of economic growth'.
The low economic growth is largely attributed to the 'substitution of
foreign goods for domestically produced goods'. This it believes is a result
of the low competitiveness of Mexican companies, partly because their old
technologies have become obsolete and new investment has replaced existing
capital stock rather than adding to it.
Specifically, the bank calls for further economic reform in four areas to
remove constraints on economic growth. The report is highly critical of
Mexico's legal system, concluding that 'weaknesses in the commercial law
framework and the mechanism for the resolution of disputes constitute
important constraints to private sector development.'
The report recommends new laws on secured transactions, which would make it
easier for banks to take possession of property when a borrower has
defaulted. Such a reform should lower Mexico's high financing costs, a
principal complaint of Mexican companies.
The bank says 'the resolution of disputes through the courts is a lengthy,
costly and unpredictable process'. It blames this in part on an
'unacceptable level of competence and integrity of the judges, especially in
the local court system'.
Suggestions for reform are vague, but include a national training institute
for judicial personnel and the establishment of an authentic civil service
in courts at state and federal levels. It proposes reforms to encourage the
provision of binding private-sector dispute resolutions. The bank says
Mexico faces two key labour challenges - increasing the quality of its work
force, and establishing a flexible labour market.
On the first, the report says the problem 'is the low and disparate quality
of the educational system, and especially of basic education'; the failure
of Mexican companies to train workers sufficiently holds back productivity
growth.
Mexico's labour market is regulated by antiquated labour law that makes it
costly to dismiss workers, exhorts companies to promote according to
seniority rather than ability, and makes it difficult to move workers
between jobs, the bank reports.
However, the bank says the main problem is not exactly the law but
agreements companies have reached with unions. The law allows for some
flexibility, but how much depends on the ability of management to win
concessions from the unions.
On infrastructure, the bank approves of the government's move to let the
private sector build and finance toll roads, electricity plants, water
systems and provide telecommunications, but is critical of the way the
policy has been carried out.
The bank calls for more competition, or regulation where that is not
possible, in the provision of infrastructure. It says the manner in which
toll road concessions have been granted needs to be improved, further
deregulation and privatisation is needed in railways, and an independent
regulator should be established in both telecommunications and the
electricity market to prevent monopoly abuses.
On environmental policy, the bank describes the government's threat of
closing polluting plants as costly, ineffective and arbitrary, since it
gives the government too much discretion in responding to businesses'
environmental violations.
Instead it says the government should rely more (as it is now doing) on
mandatory fines for lack of compliance. It recommends economic incentives,
such as taxes on polluting inputs and outputs and higher prices on natural
resources, rather than command and control regulations, as a way of
improving the environment.
Overall, the World Bank says Mexico has been a pioneer in private-sector-led
development, and gives the government high marks for stabilising the
economy. However, it evidently believes the government still has to draw up
and enforce laws that foster competition and efficiency in the private and
public sector and allow benefits of economic reform to filter down to
consumers.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Canadian budget will take only small steps: The Liberals'
real new broom is unlikely to start sweeping until 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Liberal government has worked hard in its four months in office to
prove that a new broom is sweeping through Ottawa. From promises for a
speedy overhaul of the social-security system to prime minister Jean
Chretien's modest sedan, the Liberals have tried to project a fresh,
down-to-earth approach.
The finance minister, Mr Paul Martin, is expected to try to build on that
theme when he presents his first budget in the House of Commons this
afternoon.
Mr Martin's economic assumptions and deficit forecasts are expected to be
more conservative than the perennially optimistic projections by his
Progressive Conservative predecessors over the past nine years.
The minister will undoubtedly point to a series of pre-budget 'town hall'
meetings, held across the country over the past month, as proof that he has
listened to the concerns of Canadians from all walks of life.
But anyone hoping for an imaginative new plan to achieve the Liberals' twin
goals of cutting the deficit and creating jobs is likely to be disappointed.
Judging from hints dropped by Mr Martin and his officials, the main elements
of today's budget will follow much the pattern set by the Tories. On the
spending side, the minister is expected to extend restraint on civil-service
wages and announce further defence cuts.
Despite the Liberals' criticism of Tory tax increases and signs that
Canadians' tolerance of their heavy tax burden is wearing thin, Mr Martin
plans to squeeze more revenue from taxpayers. Among the possible casualties
are the tax-free capital-gains exemption, currently set at CDollars 100,000
(Pounds 51,020), and a range of business expenses.
Mr Martin has indicated that he will aim for a budget deficit of CDollars
39bn-CDollars 40bn for the year to March 31 1995. That is down from the
CDollars 45bn estimate for the present fiscal year, but still far above the
Liberals' election promise to cut the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, equal to
about CDollars 22bn in 1994/95, by the end of their third year in office.
While fewer tax breaks and the modest deficit cut will come as a
disappointment to the business community, the word from Ottawa is that the
main purpose of today's budget is to set the stage for bolder measures in
1995.
The Liberals have promised to draw up proposals over the next 12 months to
overhaul the social security system and to conclude a new agreement on
transfers to the 10 provinces of responsibility for health, social welfare
and education.
With these two envelopes making up close to 80 per cent of total federal
spending, no meaningful assault on the deficit is possible until the reforms
are in place.
Financial markets are expected to take today's budget in their stride.
'There's no reason for anyone to be surprised,' says Mr Ted Carmichael,
senior economist at Burns Fry, a Toronto securities firm.
Domestic and foreign investors are more unsettled for the time being by
Ottawa's monetary policies. Uncertainty on this front has been heightened by
three recent developments: the first rise in US short-term interest rates in
five years, the appointment from February 1 of a new governor of the Bank of
Canada, and Mr Martin's tendency to ruminate about interest rates in public.
Mr Martin and the new bank governor, Mr Gordon Thiessen, have a strong
incentive to keep Canadian interest rates falling. Canada is pulling out of
recession far more slowly than the US. The economy is growing at an annual
rate of only about 3 per cent, compared to more than 5 per cent in the US.
The traditional gap between US and Canadian interest rates is already at its
narrowest in more than a decade. The gap on three-month Treasury bills is
only 33 basis points, compared to a peak of 600 points in early 1990. The
spread on 30-year bonds is currently 80 basis points.
The question in the minds of traders, investors and policy-makers is whether
there is room for this gap to narrow still further, or even to disappear,
without causing the Canadian dollar to nosedive.
Inflation in Canada is expected to be no more than about 1 per cent this
year, about half the rate in the US. Even so, Mr Martin sent the dollar into
a spin this month when he suggested that the rise in US rates might bring
Canadian rates below those south of the border. His comments were
immediately followed by a rise in short-term rates to protect the currency.
Bank of Nova Scotia economists noted in a recent commentary: 'The central
bank may have little choice but to sanction higher rates and spreads if
currency pressures continue.'
Despite the impressive inflation performance, the markets have yet to take
the measure of Mr Martin and Mr Thiessen. Although the new governor is
reputed to be a dedicated inflation fighter, he has yet to establish the
credibility of his predecessor, Mr John Crow.
Similarly, Mr Martin and his counterparts in the provinces (whose combined
deficits are even bigger than the federal government's) have not convinced
the markets that their deficit-cutting actions will match their words.
Until they do, economists predict that Canadian interest rates will reach US
levels only at the expense of a further slide in the Canadian dollar.

Pakistan's elite commandos last night rescued five schoolboys and their
teacher and killed three Afghan gunmen who had been keeping them hostage at
the Afghan embassy in Islamabad.
The rescue ended the 39-hour drama which began with the kidnapping of 67
children and seven teachers in a school bus, in the northern Pakistani city
of Peshawar on Sunday.
During yesterday's five-second operation, at least seven commandos threw
stun grenades and then shot the hijackers at close range.
Earlier military and civilian officials persuaded the gunmen to release 62
children and six teachers.
However, one of the gunmen threatened to kill their captives by noon today
unless they were paid a ransom of Dollars 5m and were provided with military
helicopters to fly to Afghanistan with the hostages.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Right wing rejects ANC compromise
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Right-wing parties in South Africa yesterday rejected compromise
constitutional proposals from the African National Congress and refused to
attend a multi-party conference to discuss amending the constitution to meet
their demands.
In an attempt to split the right-wing Freedom Alliance and tempt some
moderate members to defy their leaders and accept a constitutional
compromise, the ANC-dominated multi-party negotiating forum yesterday agreed
to enshrine the ANC's compromise offer in the constitution, with or without
Freedom Alliance approval.
Towards this end, the 1993 constitution was amended to give provincial
governments some powers of independent taxation,to protect provincial powers
from diminution after the April election, and to introduce separate ballots
for national and provincial elections - all important Freedom Alliance
demands.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, appealed to the right wing to
accept the compromise. 'We urge them to do South Africa a favour, and not to
plunge this country into a crisis,' he said, after a violent weekend left 48
people dead, some of them in election-related violence.
However, only a limited concession was offered to the Freedom Alliance on
the crucial issue of the powers of provincial governments in areas such as
policing and a host of other functions.
The Freedom Alliance yesterday demanded that provincial governments have
sole authority over areas such as provincial policing, provincial defence,
and the regional civil service, while the ANC continued to insist that
central government should have broadly defined powers to override provincial
government in all areas.
As part of the continuing battle to avoid blame for the failure of
constitutional talks, government and ANC negotiators last night changed the
wording of the constitution dealing with provincial powers to a form of
words which would appear more attractive to the Freedom Alliance, but which
would not have any practical effect.
It was hoped this further concession might make it possible for moderate
right-wing leaders to claim victory, without substantially affecting the
nature of the constitut ion.
Government and ANC negotiators said that there was no legal deadline for
further constitutional amendments before the April 27 elections, but that
practical difficulties would prevent any further changes after last night's
session.

Australia yesterday announced a realignment in defence priorities, shifting
the emphasis towards its south-east Asian neighbours and away from old Cold
War priorities, Reuter reports from Canberra.
'The clear message of this review is that Australia's security, like its
economic future, lies in and with our region,' Mr Robert Ray, defence
minister, said.
'This means we must be a participant, not an onlooker, in regional security
and other areas.'

Two French companies have invited a high-level Iraqi oil team to Paris, the
first such formal invitation by a Western country since the 1991 Gulf War,
the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said yesterday.
Iraq had accepted the invitation - issued by Total and Nationale Elf
Aquitaine - and would send Senior Undersecretary Taha Humud as delegation
leader.
MEES said the two companies had held many meetings in Baghdad since mid-1991
on developing the two giant fields of Nahr Umar (Total) and Majnoon (Elf)
but more negotiations would be needed before draft agreements were
finalised. No agreement can be signed until United Nations sanctions are
lifted.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Lagos still hopes to reach policy pact with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria has not abandoned efforts to reach a policy agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, Mr Kalu Kalu, the country's finance minister,
told a press conference in London yesterday.
The minister, who meets British officials today on the first leg of a tour
of the main western capitals to explain the government's policy,
acknowledged there was little prospect of an early agreement with the Fund.
The recent IMF mission to Nigeria had 'no problems on the objectives of the
(1994) budget but they expressed reservations on how the objectives we have
set ourselves would be achieved by controlling the foreign exchange rate and
interest rates,' said Mr Kalu.
But he said it remained an open question whether some of the direct controls
recently imposed would continue in 1995.
Western creditors last night saw this as a hint that the government might be
prepared to reconsider its decision to fix the naira's exchange rate at 22
to the US dollar.
The free market value is half of that.
The minister said he was concerned by rise of arrears in service payments on
the country's Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) external debt. Last year arrears
reached Dollars 6bn and are expected to exceed Dollars 8.5bn by the end of
this year.
This assumes that Nigeria will allocate up to 30 per cent of its export
earnings for debt servicing, and a projected oil price of Dollars 14 a
barrel.
If the price dropped below Dollars 14, said the minister, 'we will have to
put another hole in our belts', adding that debt service payments were
already at the 'barest minimum'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Cairo bankers play down extremist threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers in Cairo yesterday sought to play down any possible threat from
Islamic extremists who have warned that Arab and foreign banks were a target
in their anti-government campaign. The extremists had set today as a
deadline for people to withdraw money from what they called 'usurious
monuments'.
A handful of bankers said they had reinforced security, though most said
they were content with measures in place for more than a year, since the
Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the militant Islamic group, first warned that Arab and
foreign businesses might become targets in their campaign.
'There's not much more we can do, and anyway we'd rather not play into the
hands of the militants' propaganda,' one foreign banker said.
A straw poll of bankers in Cairo found few concerned by the militants'
threat and none suggesting they might avoid going in to work.
The Gama'a al-Islamiyya issued their deadline earlier this month after
planting explosive devices outside three banks in Cairo. A fourth explosive
was planted on February 15. Only two of the devices detonated, causing
superficial damage and injuring no-one.
The banks have been made targets because they charge interest, which is
forbidden according to the Islamic Sharia law the militants would like to
see strictly installed in Egypt. All but a minority of specialised Islamic
institutions charge interest, however, and banks yesterday reported no
unusual withdrawals.
The militants' warning appears to be an attempt to prove they retain the
ability to wage a continued and co-ordinated campaign against the government
despite a frequently violent crackdown by security forces.
The Gama'a al-Islamiyya's follow-up to its deadline may therefore prove some
guide to its present strength, and a test of the government's confident
claims to have broken the organisation.
Nevertheless, Gama'a claimed responsibility for an attack on Saturday in
which four people, including two foreign visitors, were injured, when gunmen
opened fire on the Cairo-Luxor train as it passed through a militant
stronghold in Upper Egypt.
In a statement faxed to news agencies, the Gama'a's standard means of public
communication, the group claimed the attack to have been in retribution for
three death sentences passed by a military court on three men charged with
an attempt late last year on the life of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak.
The three, according to Gama'a, were an army officer and two conscripts
charged with mining an airstrip close to the Libyan border at Sidi Barrani
shortly before a visit by Mr Mubarak.
More than 300 people have fallen victim to the violent campaign between
Islamic militants and security forces over the past two years.
The militant groups have specifically targeted members of the security
forces, high-ranking government officials and the tourism industry, the
latter in what has been a largely successful campaign to damage a vital
component of Egypt's economy.
Last month, Gama'a issued specific warnings to foreigners to leave the
country or risk becoming embroiled in what it called its 'ferocious' battle
with the government.

The trial of five men charged with breaking Singapore's official secrets act
by disclosing a government economic growth figure before it was officially
released resumed yesterday, with the defence presenting its case.
The five, two financial journalists and three local economists, are accused
of colluding in the disclosure of the 4.6 per cent second-quarter growth
figure for 1992 which was published in the Singapore Business Times
newspaper.
Among the accused are Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the Business Times, and
Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank.
The trial, which ran for 26 days last year before being adjourned, has
greatly interested Singapore's financial community.
The judge has given the defence five weeks to present its case. If found
guilty, the five accused face a maximum two years' jail or a SDollars 2,000
(Pounds 860) fine or both. They are on bail of SDollars 5,000 each.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Bolger welcomes US thaw
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, yesterday welcomed a US
decision to upgrade military and official contacts with Wellington.
Relations were restricted in 1987 when New Zealand passed a law prohibiting
visits by nuclear powered or armed vessels.
Mr Bolger said the policy shift would enable New Zealand to have the kind of
dialogue 'commensurate with our shared interests and values on both
bilateral and broader strategic issues'.
In a weekend statement, the US State Department emphasised that the Clinton
administration had decided to resume senior level contacts, but this did not
mean a restoration of US defence relationships with New Zealand or the
revitalisation of the ANZUS pact, which formerly linked Australia, New
Zealand and the US.
The statement said the US would continue to press for a change in New
Zealand's anti-nuclear legislation. However, the State Department now
recognised that 'our two countries had important business to conduct outside
the area of defence relations. . . To advance that goal, we have decided to
restore senior level contacts with New Zealand on political, strategic and
broad security matters,' it said.
Asked whether the government would now consider amending legislation to
allow American or British nuclear warships to visit, Mr Bolger said there
was no proposal to review the law. 'I would caution against seeing the thaw
as a full restoration of ANZUS.'
President Clinton had undertaken to review the relationship at a meeting
with Mr Bolger at Seattle in December.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Islamic state waits in Algeria's bloody wings: A look at a
nation contemptuous of the old and distrustful of the new
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never has the holy month of Ramadan meant such misery for millions of
Algerians. They do not have to wait for the agreement being negotiated with
the International Monetary Fund - which is bound to include a hefty
devaluation of the dinar - to appreciate the extent to which the government
has lost control of the economy.
The price of onions has nearly trebled since December, that of coffee has
doubled and of cooking oil has increased by more than half. On the black
market, lentils cost three times more than in state shops, while sugar costs
50 per cent more.
Meanwhile the confrontation between the security forces and armed Islamic
groups is claiming at least 100 dead every week. The death of a Russian
civilian technician last Thursday and of a French shopkeeper yesterday
brings the number of foreigners slain since last September to 30. Foreigners
have withdrawn to the major coastal cities of Algiers, Oran and Annaba or,
in the case of foreign oil companies, to the comparative safety of the
southern desert.
Although Ramadan has brought a little life and some cars into the streets of
Algiers after dusk, most people lock themselves up at home as soon as the
sun sets. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, sleep in a different apartment or
house every night. The most radical group, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
has threatened to kill women, intellectuals and civil servants who dare
question the need to impose Islamic 'sharia' law.
Earlier this month a GIA spokesman publicly stated for the first time that
his movement would attack 'Jews, Christians and other non-believers because
they support a colonialist plot. This will help the return of Islam as
defined by the prophet Mohammed'.
Last week the group stepped up pressure by threatening 17,000 tax
collectors, arguing that under Islam, zakat is the only acceptable form of
revenue collection. Tax revenues excluding the oil sector and customs duties
were AD112bn (Pounds 3.2bn) last year, AD41bn of which came from direct
taxation.
In the Mitidja plain around Algiers local 'Islamic enclaves' flourish, where
Algerian newspapers in French are banned, as is smoking. Many Algerians who
two years ago applauded the army for suspending the second round of
elections, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, now appear
resigned to the advent of an Islamic state.
Many simply pray that violence will stop and that the increasingly savage
acts of terrorism will be halted. The nervousness of many young soldiers
manning roadblocks and policemen bear witness to the distress and confusion
that the events of the past two years have brought to 26m Algerians.
In his first speech as head of state, General Liamine Zeroual recently made
clear his belief that security measures alone would not help Algeria out of
a crisis which requires a total rethink of the economic, social and cultural
policies adopted since independence. He acknowledged Algeria's aspirations
for 'radical change'.
General Zeroual is however faced with a dilemma. Many members and leaders of
the now banned FIS movement appear willing to talk, but are increasingly
outflanked by their more radical supporters, a number of whom are switching
support to groups such as the GIA and the myriad other proponents of
violence.
Those Algerians who oppose an Islamic state are not united, but millions
find it difficult to tolerate the same faces on television and in the
newspapers that they have had to endure since independence in 1962. Their
resentment at 32 years of single-party rule and the corruption of a state
command economy is considerable. Yet senior officials continue to make
public statements that few Algerians believe.
Mr Baba Ahmed, the director of the treasury, said last week that negotiating
with the IMF was a decision 'freely' taken by the government. Mr Mourad
Benhachenhou, the minister of the economy, whose vitriolic attacks on the
reforming government led by Mr Mouloud Hamrouche in 1989-91 have not been
forgotten, said that the kind of medicine Algeria will accept from the IMF
must be 'defined in such a way that it does not bring about any kind of
social unrest'.
For his part, Mr Redha Malek, the prime minister since August, who was
confirmed in his post by the new head of state, insisted that terrorism has
gone 'beyond the stage of barbarity and must be liquidated'. As Algerian
ambassador to Washington, he played a key role in securing the release of
the US diplomats held hostage in Tehran in 1981, but his language and manner
cut little ice with the mass of his countrymen, two thirds of whom are under
30 years of age.
The prime minister and other senior Algerian officials are pleased with the
French government's 'clear policy' of support for Algeria. The prime
minister insists that the time for declarations is finished. Referring to
the desperate need to loosen the burden of Algeria's foreign debt payments,
which this year will absorb all the country's oil and gas income, he added:
'We will now count our friends.'
Most western capitals are worried and bewildered by the violence which is
increasingly engulfing North Africa's largest country. Many believe dialogue
with the radical Islamic groups is inevitable, and all know it will be
difficult. Some even fear that it might prove impossible.
The Algerian army, which holds centre stage, has tried and failed to
convince respected members of the former Hamrouche government to take senior
government posts. It knows that Algerians want to see new faces. It also
knows that, were its ranks to split, disaster could ensue.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Singapore suffers an embarrassment of riches: Growth is
greater than is comfortable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many finance ministers can feel as comfortable preparing their annual
budget as Singapore's Mr Richard Hu. Mr Hu's budget address tomorrow will be
set against the background of a far stronger economic performance last year
than had been expected.
According to official figures published yesterday, the Singapore economy
grew 9.9 per cent in 1993, the biggest increase since 1988, and a sharp
acceleration from the 6 per cent growth of the previous year.
Fiscal deficits are virtually unknown in Singapore, and there is little in
the country's recent economic performance or near-term prospects which could
give Mr Hu cause for serious concern.
The surge in growth last year was due mainly to a big increase in activity
in the financial services sector, with rapid bank-loan growth combined with
a sharp increase in stock market turnover. The financial and business
services sector grew 13 per cent last year, more than double the growth rate
in 1992.
But there was also an unexpectedly big jump in manufacturing activity, with
overall manufacturing output increasing 9.8 per cent in 1993 against 2.5 per
cent in the previous year. Singapore's electronics industry, which produces
half the world's output of disk drives as well as many other computer
peripherals, benefited from the US recovery and a computer price war in many
export markets.
Mr Hu says last year's economic growth rate was 'somewhat higher than is
comfortable' and is forecasting expansion of 6-8 per cent this year;
economists generally expect 7-8 per cent.
In spite of the high growth, the government would appear to have little to
worry about on the inflation front: Singapore's consumer price index rose
2.4 per cent last year, a marginal increase on 1992. This year will see a
one-time blip in inflation caused by the introduction of a 3 per cent
general sales tax (GST) in April, expected to add 2.5 per cent to the
consumer price index.
The government, which oversees foreign exchange reserves of more than
Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn), controls inflation primarily through currency
market intervention to help a steady appreciation of the Singapore dollar.
Mr Hu says foreign capital inflows, particularly into the stock market, in
effect mean government policy not to internationalise the local currency has
been relaxed somewhat. But he says: 'Our fundamentals are strong enough to
avoid destabilising flows'.
Also warding off an over-heated economy are domestic interest rates which
had already begun to edge up before the US Federal Reserve tightened the
monetary reins earlier this month, a factor expected to dampen domestic
economic activity during the year.
Few surprises are expected in tomorrow's budget. Mr Hu had already announced
the introduction of GST this year. Economists say the finance minister is
likely to cut corporation tax at some point within the next few years from
the present level of 27 per cent to the government's stated target of 25 per
cent. Mr Hu may also raise employers' contributions to the central provident
fund, the government's forced savings system.
However, Mr Hu does admit concern about wage increases in Singapore's large
public sector and therefore may be reluctant to increase employers' costs
further. The need for Singapore to remain competitive is a constant
government theme. Singapore, with only 2.8m people, faces severe labour
shortages. Another constraint is a shortage of land.
Surrounding countries with lower wage rates are challenging the island
republic's export competitiveness. Ministry of Trade and Industry officials
say last year saw an improvement in productivity and a drop in overall unit
labour costs: but Singapore has to keep climbing the technological ladder to
gain advantage over its neighbours.
In spite of high costs relative to other rapidly-growing Asian countries,
Singapore's efficiency and infrastructure continue to attract substantial
new investment, particularly from US companies which committed SDollars
1.45bn (Pounds 625m) or 37 per cent of new manufacturing investment last
year, mainly in the petrochemical, electronics and medical supplies
industries.
Singapore's fortunes remain closely linked to economic activity in the US,
which accounts for nearly a quarter of domestic exports. Singapore's exports
to the US grew 12 per cent last year, while Malaysia overtook the EC as the
island republic's second biggest export market.
Seeking to turn its expertise and other countries' cheaper labour costs to
its advantage, the government has invested several hundred million dollars
in its programme to assist local companies in investments abroad,
principally in industrial parks such as at Wuxi in China, Bangalore in India
and Batam island in Indonesia.
In a country where carefully worked out policies are repeatedly driven home
by a chorus of ministers and officials, the drive to 'regionalise' the local
economy is likely to be a theme of Mr Hu's budget. He has ample resources at
his disposal, though Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development
Board which is spearheading the policy, warns that Singapore will not be a
'regional Father Christmas' and will ensure that every project earns a good
return.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Danes aim for lower deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Danish finance minister, promised yesterday a lower
budget deficit in 1995. This follows criticism by leading economists and
opposition parties that the government's expansionist fiscal policy,
introduced to kick-start the economy out of recession, will get out of hand.
The budget deficit rose from 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 4.4 per cent
last year, in 1993, according to economy ministry figures. The deficit for
1994 is projected at 4.8 per cent.
Inflation in Austria rose an annualised 3.1 per cent in January after rising
3.5 per cent in December. Inflation rose 4.1 per cent in January last year.
Germany's gross monetary reserves fell DM500m to DM117.6bn in the week ended
February 15, the Bundesbank said. Its foreign liabilities rose DM500m to
DM23.8bn.

<TEXT>
Poland's budget policies have won the approval of the International Monetary
Fund, opening the way to a 20 per cent reduction in the country's Dollars
33bn debt to western government creditors, writes Christopher Bobinski in
Warsaw. Mr Michael Deppler, IMF mission chief, said yesterday Poland had
fulfilled the terms of its 1993 agreement and would be negotiating a new
stand-by arrangement.
The draft budget, which foresees an 83,000bn zlotys (Pounds 2.56bn) deficit
(4 per cent of gross domestic product), will be approved by parliament next
month. IMF approval is needed by Paris Club government creditors, which
wrote down 30 per cent of the country's debt in 1991 and promised a further
20 per cent this year if the country remained in favour with the Fund.
Poland can also use the Dollars 500m stand-by loan which becomes available
at the end of March to help finance its debt reduction agreement with
western banks in the London Club although the talks centre on a Polish
suggestion, resisted by the banks, that the Dollars 12.3bn owed them be
reduced by half to match the Paris Club deal.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Azeris want UK help in Karabakh conflict: Aliev talks to
John Lloyd on eve of his visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Azerbaijan's president, Mr Heydar Aliev, is to press Britain to take a 'more
active part' in finding a solution to the former Soviet republic's conflict
with Armenia around the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno Karabakh.
In an interview in Baku, Mr Aliev said: 'Britain has always taken a good,
objective position on this conflict, and there has been some sympathy shown
with our position from the United Nations, with four resolutions calling on
the Armenians to withdraw their forces from our territory.
'Now I would like Britain. . . to more actively concern itself with getting
those resolutions fulfilled.'
The Azeri president, who recently visited Turkey and France, arrives in
Britain today.
He wants to use his three-day trip to 'make Britain and Europe more aware of
our point of view, and the possibilities of doing business with us'. He and
his advisers are convinced the west is strongly influenced on Nagorno
Karabakh by Armenian communities in the west.
He and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, have exchanged letters on the
desirability of signing a contract on Caspian Sea oil exploration. Mr Aliev
is aware this gives him leverage to press Azerbaijan's case for withdrawal
of Armenian troops and settlement of the Karabakh issue under international
auspices.
Mr Aliev said 20 per cent of Azeri territory outside Nagorno Karabakh was
occupied by Armenian forces. 'We now have over 1m refugees, living in
terrible conditions,' he said.
Mr Vafa Gulizade, his adviser on international affairs, said on Sunday a
ceasefire had been agreed between Armenian and Azeri defence ministers under
the chairmanship of General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister. Forces
were to pull back to defined positions and a meeting at presidential level
was to be held next month.
However, Mr Aliev was cool on the agreement. 'Russia has announced a
ceasefire several times and said it can get the withdrawal of Armenian
troops,' he said. But during the ceasefires Armenian troops had taken
several regions.
Mr Aliev admitted Russian influence had increased since he became president
in a bloodless coup last year. 'Russia is our neighbour,' he said. 'It's one
of the most powerful countries n the world. It's been connected with the
fate of Azerbaijan for 200 years. So what should we do - have a state of
hostilities with it?'
He said it was possible the Russian oil comopany Lukoil would join the
consortium of western companies led by British Petroleum which is likely to
sign a contract soon for exploitation of Caspian oil reserves. But 'further
negotiations' were needed.
Asked about the possibility of Russian bases being established in
Azerbaijan, he said: 'The question hasn't come up before me. Maybe there is
such a desire on the part of the Russians. And of course there are Russian
bases in Armenia and in Georgia.'
Mr Aliev, a former Communist party leader, now says: 'We must never go back
to the days of communism and socialist economy. My most important task,
besides ending the war, is to bring a civilised level of democracy and a
market economy to Azerbaijan.'

FT  22 FEB 94 / Sarajevo guns set to find new targets: A look at the likely
moves to consolidate territory won in other parts of Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from the United Nations, the European Union, the Russian
Federation and the US meet in Bonn today to discuss what gains made in the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo can be extended to the rest of the republic.
But military analysts are pessimistic that diplomats will be able to
capitalise on the ceasefire in Sarajevo, let alone react in time to stem the
flow of more artillery to eastern Bosnia, halt the fighting between Moslem
and Croats in central Bosnia, or lift the siege imposed by Croats on the
city of Mostar in the west of the republic.
While attention remains focused on Sarajevo, military analysts believe the
Serbs in eastern Bosnia, and the Croats in western Bosnia, will speed up
their attempts to consolidate their grip over territory they have won in
battle. The Bosnian government forces, now backed by a well-trained
infantry, will also focus their attention beyond Sarajevo.
'Sarajevo is important for the Bosnian Serbs, but it is not as important as
what they want to achieve strategically in the eastern part of the country,'
said Mr Charles Dick, head of the UK-based Conflict Studies Research Centre
at Sandhurst.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, has always aimed at linking
eastern Bosnia to Serbia proper. The Bosnian Croats have a corresponding
goal in western Hercegovina. They may still be able to realise those aims.
For instance, Mr Dick and other analysts believe that Bosnian Serb forces,
without too many restrictions, can transfer any weapons moved out of the
12-mile zone around Sarajevo to other parts of the country.
'There is nothing to stop them,' a Nato diplomat said. 'The point is that
Nato cannot keep declaring a new ultimatum to lift the sieges of Gorazde,
Zepa, or Maglaj because it might be seen as bluffing if Serb - and Croat
forces - do the minimum to meet any deadline' and the threat is not followed
through.
Already Bosnian Serb forces are attempting to link up the Serb-held
territory of Krajina, in south-western Croatia, with Serbia-proper.
This involves cutting a deal with Mr Fikret Abdic, a former Bosnian
government minister who broke away from the Bosnian side, and took over the
control of Bihac, a Moslem enclave in the north-western corner of Bosnia. It
would also involve negotiating a passage through, or around Brcko, on the
Croat border.
'If you want to prevent any more killing, and more territorial gains, you
have to provide thousands of peace-keepers,' a Nato diplomat said. 'But the
omens are not good. General (Sir Michael) Rose (the UN commander in Bosnia)
has not even managed to obtain 3,000 extra troops which he requested last
week. So what kind of message is that sending out to all three sides?'
In the case of Croatia, he added, the government in Zagreb had given no
indication it would withdraw its troops from western Hercegovina.
'We applied some kind of pressure. But it has had little affect,' a US
military expert said. 'I sometimes wonder do our threats carry clout or not?
If not, then there is no reason for the Bosnian government to stop fighting,
because, unlike the Croats and Serbs, they have nothing to lose.'
That is why any UN follow-up plan to the ceasefire in Sarajevo will be
watched closely by all three sides. 'If the roads leading into and out of
the city are not placed under UN control, and if the siege is not completely
lifted very quickly, we will have squandered what political will we mustered
last week,' the Nato diplomat said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Russia cracks down on banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday increased the minimum capital requirement for commercial
banks by 20 times in an attempt to flush out hundreds of small
under-capitalised banks and consolidate the Russian banking sector.
Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said that from next
Monday, the minimum capital requirement for new banks would be increased to
Rbs2bn (Pounds 868,000 at the market rate) from a present threshold of
Rbs100m. Existing banks, as well as those which manage to get a licence by
next Monday, will be given until January 1995 to increase their capital to
Rbs2bn. From 1999, the minimum capital requirement for all players will rise
to a European Union threshold of Ecu5m (Pounds 3.78m).
Mr Tulin said the aim was to protect depositors, reduce money-laundering
through the banking sector and help banks compete internationally.
Exempt from the new requirement would be agricultural co-operative banks
which the authorities want to establish in the Russian countryside and which
would keep the Rbs100m threshold. Another threshold of Rbs500m would be
established for banks which did not take deposits from the population.
With inflation of around 20 per cent a month, unchanged minimum capital
requirements have made it increasingly easy to start a bank. 'A situation
where entrepreneurs face the choice of either buying a good car or setting
up a bank is paradoxical and abnormal,' Mr Tulin told a news conference.
Despite the fact that many of Russia's 2,000 banks are small and
under-capitalised, many of the threats to Russian banking come from larger
banks, in particular those owed lots of money by ailing enterprises which
also happen to be their shareholders. Other problems are institutional,
including a shortage of tools for assessing project risk and recovering
loans.
Mr Andrei Tsumailo, vice-president of Most-Bank, one of Russia's big private
commercial banks, hailed the plan's 1999 target as a 'reasonable long-term
goal'. But he believed that in the shorter term many banks' shareholders,
such as ailing industrial enterprises, would be unable to raise the
necessary capital. At best, such companies would have to divert funds
earmarked for investment 'in an economy which is under-capitalised in every
sector'.
Mr Tulin said banks which could not meet the new requirements would either
have to merge with bigger institutions or fold. The central bank last year
withdrew the licences of 19 banks, many of which met its minimum capital
requirements but abused the central bank's overdraft facility.

FT  22 FEB 94 / EU up in arms over Alpine truck ban: Last weekend's vote in
Switzerland could complicate the path to a wider Europe

<TEXT>
Switzerland yesterday came under blistering attack from European Union
countries over its voters' decision to ban foreign trucks from travelling
through the Swiss Alps.
Italy and Germany, which depend heavily on the Gotthard Pass for the
transport of goods, said they would seek talks within the EU to consider the
implications.
There were worries in Brussels yesterday that the Swiss vote in a referendum
on Sunday could scupper chances of the EU reaching an agreement with Austria
on lorry traffic through its Alpine passes. This has been an obstacle in the
negotiations on Austrian entry to the EU, due to start their final stage
today.
Germany warned that closer ties between the EU and Switzerland would suffer
because of the vote to ban foreign road transit within 10 years. The
decision was supported by nearly 52 per cent of those who took part, in
defiance of the Swiss government's campaign against a ban.
Italy called for an urgent meeting of EU transport ministers, warning that
the decision had set a dangerous precedent and could have a serious knock-on
effect in other countries. France, Spain and the Netherlands also demanded a
tough EU response.
About 1,000 foreign trucks a day cut through Switzerland along the Gotthard
Pass, which bisects the country north to south.
The Swiss government had argued, in its campaign against the ban, that a
12-year accord with the EU restraining heavy traffic provided adequate
protection. EU and Swiss negotiators recently agreed that Switzerland could
maintain its 28 tonne limit and a ban on trucks using roads at night and
weekends. This agreement may be undermined by the vote, provoking
retaliatory measures.
Yesterday, representatives of the Italian road hauliers' association said
the annual cost of the Swiss ban would be L750bn (Pounds 300m) in extra
mileage alone. They calculate journeys will be 400km longer on average.
Mr Raffaele Costa, Italian transport minister, said yesterday: 'Even if the
Swiss are talking of introducing these measures over a period of 10 years to
allow plans for alternative transport, matters will not be easy if not
impossible.' He also pointed out that environmental considerations already
made transalpine traffic difficult.
In Bonn, the transport ministry said: 'The acceptance of the Alp Initiative
(campaign against transit traffic) makes the negotiations with the EU
considerably more difficult.'
The German association of long-haul carriers denounced the move as 'a
further step for Switzerland on its way towards isolation in Europe'. The
move would lead to traffic problems in France, Austria and in the southern
German state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
The association said it would lobby Brussels to threaten Switzerland with
reciprocal measures for Swiss trucks, such as forcing them to use railways
only.
However, Germany's opposition Social Democrats welcomed the Swiss move as a
victory for environmental policy, and Bund, the German association for the
protection of nature, said the ban represented 'a milestone toward resolving
the ecological problems of the Alps'.
Austria believes the Swiss decision will strengthen its hand in negotiations
for EU entry. Mr Viktor Klima, transport minister said Austrian voters would
support entry only if a 12-year transit treaty with the EU, due to run until
2004, remained intact.
The treaty restricts lorry traffic through Austria's passes on environmental
grounds. This would have to be entirely renegotiated once Austria enters the
EU, but the Twelve were poised to offer a three-year transition before
replacing the agreement.
EU diplomats now say that a Swiss ban would displace Alpine transit traffic
to Austria. Many Austrians argue that they should not have to accept the
EU's lower environmental standards as a condition of EU membership.

IG Metall, the German engineering workers' union, is set to begin strike
action in the north German state of Lower Saxony on March 7.
Union leaders said yesterday the strike would start there if, as they
expected, this was agreed in a local ballot of workers.
If the walkout fails to force employers to agree to union demands within two
weeks, the strike will be broadened through northern Germany, Mr Klaus
Zwickel, IG Metall chairman, threatened.
Despite the confrontational stance, Germany's biggest union was at pains to
spell out it had no wish to drive companies to the wall in the country's
severe recession.
The choice of Lower Saxony was designed to minimise the impact of the strike
on industry, Mr Zwickel explained. 'We want to avoid massive social
conflict,' he added.
The strike will initially affect only 90,000 workers at 230 companies. If it
spreads to Hamburg, Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein, a further 170,000 workers
at 380 businesses will be involved.
The numbers are small compared to the 1m metalworkers in the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg in the south-west, traditionally an area where strikes
have started in order to have maximum impact.
Moreover, the union stressed it wanted to avoid disruptive knock-on effects
and would steer clear of sectors worst hit by the current downturn.
'In order to keep the conflict within boundaries, we will at first call out
strikes at companies where there will be no knock-on effect in the metal and
electrical industries,' Mr Zwickel said.
Companies in the troubled car components sector, of which there are many in
Lower Saxony, will not be affected by the strike call. Nor will financially
troubled companies in other sectors be targeted, the union said. The strike
will have no impact on Volkswagen, the car group based in Lower Saxony: its
workers are covered by a separate agreement with the union.
The stoppage seems aimed at financially stable companies, primarily in
machine tools.
Union members will be balloted between March 1 and 3. The decision to
postpone further strike action until two weeks after the beginning of a
strike in Lower Saxony shows the union's desire to avoid conflict, Mr
Zwickel argued.
'It is up to the employers to decide whether the strike remains within
boundaries or whether it becomes a full-scale conflict,' he declared.
IG Metall's tactics seem designed to put pressure on the Gesamtmetall
employers' association to reach a compromise in the pay talks, which broke
down after both sides had made significant concessions.
The union has already stepped back from its initial claim for wage rises of
up to 6 per cent, while employers have relented in their calls to abolish
holiday bonuses. The dispute now centres on how employees should be paid for
working flexible hours.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Enlargement talks snagged on fishing

European Union foreign ministers were last night struggling to agree a
common line on fish in the EU membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway, which restart today in the increasingly remote hope of
concluding by March 1.
Intractable opposition from Spain, France and Ireland to Norwegian ambitions
on future fisheries arrangements could prevent agreement on entry terms with
the four, EU negotiators predicted.
Norway wants to retain control over its rich fisheries resources, but at the
same time to have full access to the EU market for its fish products from
the day it becomes a member, as well as access to Union waters.
Spain, which joined the EU in 1986, will not get full access to the latter
until 2003. Madrid persuaded its partners yesterday that Norway, and in
lesser measure Sweden and Finland, could not be offered a deal which
'discriminates' against existing member states.
The 12 foreign ministers also mandated the European Commission to seek the
'best possible access' for Union fishing fleets in Nordic waters - tacit
acceptance of Spain's insistence that it has historic rights in Norwegian
waters, from which its vessels were barred after 1981. Norway has repeatedly
refused to countenance any further access for the EU.
But the Twelve could not agree on market access for Norwegian fish. France
and Ireland produced a joint paper yesterday calling for restrictions on
Norwegian salmon, herring and mackerel entering the EU. The UK too has
concerns about cheap Norwegian salmon imports but held back from supporting
import quotas. Ministers were last night trying to agree on some form of
safeguards regime against sudden import surges.
Even before yesterday's talks began, the vexed negotiations to bring
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the EU had been complicated by
other hardline Spanish demands, among them Madrid's insistence that money
the rich new northerners put into the Brussels budget should be spent in the
poorer south of the Union.
But as what should have been the beginning of the last lap of the
enlargement talks began in Brussels yesterday, tactically ill-timed requests
by Sweden and Austria that their budget contributions should be phased in
served only to prematurely sharpen the money issue. The Swedes in
particular, who want exemption from three fifths of their EU payment for
three years, appear to have made Spain's partners more receptive to the
agenda Madrid is trying to set in the talks.
If membership terms are not settled by the first week of next month, it will
be virtually impossible for the four to enter the EU by January next year.
Missing the deadline, says the senior EU negotiator, 'could decrease their
interest (in joining), and increase our lust for a bigger cake' in terms of
the Nordic and Alpine countries' money and resources.
The UK and Germany, which contribute most to the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 53bn)
budget, are already positioning themselves to demand that the newcomers' net
contributions - worth Ecu1.7bn on the Commission's first serious estimates -
should be used to reduce their own EU payments.
Until the Swedish budget request, Spain's main concern, shared with the UK,
was to preserve existing EU majority voting rules enabling relatively modest
alliances within the Twelve to block measures affecting national interests.
But wherever Spain's demands settle, yesterday's lunchtime talks between the
EU foreign ministers left little doubt that the money and resources question
is nagging away at several member states, rich and poor.
Spain has German support in opposing Commission plans to make thinly
populated and inhospitable parts of northern Sweden and Norway eligible for
the same levels of EU regional aid as Andalucia and the eastern German
Lander. Brussels yesterday backtracked and proposed an analogous, slightly
less generous, and possibly time-limited aid regime the applicants at first
sight are inclined to reject.
But it is in the cost of aligning the farm subsidy regimes of the candidate
countries with EU norms that blood could be spilt. Sweden's farm prices are
now close to the EU's, but Austria's are about 25 per cent higher, Finland's
50 per cent more, and Norwegian prices are double those within the 12.
The EU concedes that for a mix of socio-economic, cultural, environmental,
and even security reasons, extra farm subsidies to keep the Alps and the
Arctic populated are legitimate. But who is to pay?

FT  22 FEB 94 / Brussels to study Procter acquisition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission is to hold a full investigation into the acquisition
by Procter  Gamble, the US consumer products group, of Vereinigte
Papierwerke Schickedanz, a subsidiary of the German partnership Gustav und
Grete Schickedanz, it was announced in Brussels yesterday.
The commission will consider whether the acquisition by Procter  Gamble
GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Procter  Gamble, breaches the
Commission's competition rules in the European market for female sanitary
protection.
The Commission inquiry follows a preliminary investigation into the
implications of the acquisition for the European markets in diapers and
feminine protection.
Procter  Gamble has promised to divest VPS's baby diaper business and part
of its feminine protection business to comply witb EU competition rules.
But the Commission remained concerned the moves still left Procter  Gamble
in breach of EU competition rules in the sanitary-towel sector of the
feminine protection market, not least because Procter  Gamble would acquire
VPS's leading sanitary-towel brand in Germany, the commission said.
'Whether the geographic market concerned is national or EEA-wide, the
combined market shares of Procter  Gamble and VPS raise serious doubts as
to the operation's compatibility with the Common Market,' the Commission
said.
It pointed out that factors such as consumer brand loyalty, high promotion
costs and the strength of Procter  Gamble in branded consumer products
meant there were already significant barriers to market entry.
The key task for the commission now would be to define the feminine
protection market, especially if it was national or European in nature, Mr
Bruno Julien, commission spokesman said.
Under EU rules the investigation will take up to four months.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Newcomers swell Italian election lists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 80 per cent of the members of Italy's next parliament are likely
to be either new to national politics or politicians who have changed
parties. This became evident yesterday as the list of candidates in the
March 27 election closed before the campaign begins formally on Friday.
Former leading figures such as former prime ministers Mr Bettino Craxi and
Mr Arnaldo Forlani have stepped down, discredited by corruption scandals.
The parties, new and old, have recognised that all those tainted by the
scandals risk being a political liability and the emphasis is on new or
acceptably recycled faces.
The greatest haggling has been within the Popular Party (PPI) - previously
the long-governing Christian Democrats - who have forged a tenuous electoral
alliance with the Italian Pact movement of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum
leader.
The PPI and the Pact were the last to hammer out an agreement on candidates
for the 475 seats in the chamber of deputies to be elected by the new
first-past-the-post system. The remaining 155 seats will be decided by the
old proportional representation system.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned politician who has injected
the main element of uncertainty into the result, is to contest a seat in the
historic centre of Rome having originally sought a Milan constituency.
He is being opposed by Mr Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister in the present
government, who is standing as a candidate for the Progressive Alliance,
dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
The two men could not be more different. Mr Berlusconi represents
entrepreneurial success and television soap opera culture; Mr Spaventa, a
Fellow of All Souls at Oxford, is a brilliant intellect with a technocratic
background. The third main candidate in this constituency is Mr Alberto
Michelini, the closest aide of Mr Segni and strongly identified with the
Roman Catholic organisation Opus Dei.
Mr Berlusconi had originally considered a Milan constituency but, following
an agreement with the populist Northern League, agreed to let Mr Umberto
Bossi, the League's leader, treat the city as his seat. The League alliance
with Mr Berlusconi's new Forza Italia movement appears to be holding. But
there are continued strains over Mr Berlusconi's links in southern Italy
with National Alliance, the renamed neo-fascist MSI movement of Mr
Gianfranco Fini.
The polls show Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia holding 25 per cent of the
vote, well clear of any other party. The polls also indicate that Forza
Italia, League and National Alliance movement would win about 45 per cent of
the vote, insufficient to form a government. Also, once the campaign starts,
the polls are likely to change and the PDS alliance believes it can recover
ground.

FT  22 FEB 94 / O'Reilly moves to increase stake in Independent battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of The Independent and Independent on Sunday
newspapers intensified last night as Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish publisher,
moved to increase his stake in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the two
titles.
If successful, this move would make it unlikely that a rival consortium led
by Mirror Group Newspapers could structure a deal satisfactory to all its
members. It is the second time within weeks that the plans of the MGN-led
consortium have been frustrated by Mr O'Reilly's group, Independent
Newspapers of Ireland.
It is expected that Mr O'Reilly, who yesterday morning held 24.99 per cent
of Newspaper Publishing, will shortly be able to raise his stake to 29.99
per cent - just below the level that would trigger a full bid for the
company.
Independent Newspapers of Ireland was last night contacting institutional
shareholders and offering 350p cash per share, conditional on approval from
the Department of Trade and Industry, for the increase in its shareholding.
A bid by the MGN consortium was earlier this month trumped within hours by
Independent Newspapers of Ireland. On Sunday the consortium increased its
offer in an effort to move its 48 per cent stake above the 50 per cent mark.
It raised its bid from 261.6p to 350p a share, in a mixture of cash and MGN
shares but, as the independent directors of Newspaper Publishing noted
yesterday, the cash alternative has not been raised beyond 250p. The latest
move means MGN itself could end up with a 20 per cent stake - in second
place to Mr O'Reilly - compared with the nearly 40 per cent it originally
envisaged.
All parties to the battle are due to meet DTI officials today to discuss the
future of Newspaper Publishing. The MGN consortium has asked Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to allow a takeover without a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry on the grounds that the newspapers
are not economic as a going concern.
Apart from MGN, the consortium includes El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica
of Italy, and founders of the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith,
the editor-in-chief. It has so far refused to co-operate with Mr O'Reilly's
camp and he has been denied representation on the board. But this latest
development will put pressure on the consortium to come to an arrangement
with him.
The independent directors of Newspaper Publishing, who are due to meet again
tomorrow, held back yesterday from recommending to shareholders the
increased bid from the MGN consortium. They said they welcomed the
'significant improvement' in the bid, but wanted to see further details of
how the consortium planned to run the business.
The directors are also waiting to see if Mr O'Reilly is prepared to make a
full bid, which they have been urging him to do.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Firms could be barred under PIA regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of firms in the financial services industry could be prevented from
doing business by the proposed new watchdog body intended to improve
protection for private investors.
The Personal Investment Authority, which yesterday published details of how
it intended to work, gave a clear warning that firms approved by present
regulators would not be guaranteed acceptance under the new regime.
Mr Joe Palmer, the authority's chairman, said: 'Though we'll be relying on
data from existing regulators, the standards and decision-making are the
PIA's'
Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, emphasised that the onus would be on
firms to show why they should be admitted to the regulator, rather than on
the regulator to admit them.
Up to 6,000 individuals and firms, from small independent financial advisers
to large banks, building societies and life companies, could be eligible to
apply for membership.
The authority expects to be in operation by mid-July this year, but still
faces resistance from some sections of the financial services industry,
including several leading life insurance companies.
The PIA's hand in overcoming industry opposition was strengthened yesterday
by a statement from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, that it was 'minded to recognise' the PIA as the new watchdog for
private investors, and that it intended to end its recognition of present
retail regulators.
This means that members of Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the
life insurance industry, and Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for
independent financial advisers, with misgivings about the PIA will not be
able to remain under their present regulators indefinitely.
Instead, firms will have to choose between being regulated by the PIA or
directly by the SIB, which has hinted it might 'sub-contract' this task to
the PIA.
There was a cautious reaction from the financial industry to the authority's
prospectus but it was largely welcomed by existing regulators. Lautro
highlighted the improvements in procedures for dealing with complaints
against members and the 'risk-based' approach to regulation.
The Consumers' Association called the PIA the 'last chance for
self-regulation' and urged the new body to 'ratchet up the threshold of
minimum competence'. The PIA has faced some criticism for deciding that
people working in the financial services industry should make up only 10 of
the 21 board members.
Mr Palmer insisted the plans still amounted to self-regulation. Mr Anthony
Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, urged potential PIA members to
'consider the prospectus positively'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Western leaders divided on next move in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, JUDY DEMPSEY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Disagreements between western capitals were emerging yesterday over how to
capitalise on the ceasefire and continuing demilitarisation in the Bosnian
capital, Sarajevo.
President Bill Clinton promised to renew US efforts to achieve peace in
Bosnia, using the 'breathing space' won by Nato's apparent success in
forcing the withdrawal of heavy guns from around Sarajevo.
But he remained wary about issuing further ultimatums in other areas of
Bosnia, cautioning that Nato should 'not undertake a mission it is not able
to perform'.
However, Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, said Nato should be
ready to go further: 'The Nato partners . . . in consultation with the UN,
should tell the parties concerned in Bosnia that we will not hesitate to
widen this measure to other places in Bosnia if there too the hostilities do
not stop.'
Nato and the United Nations called off plans for air strikes after Bosnian
Serbs and government forces moved or handed in their heavy artillery by the
Sunday midnight deadline.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned that the threat of air
strikes remained. 'If there are heavy weapons discovered within the
exclusion zone or if they go back in there, they are subject to attack by
Nato,' he said before meeting Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's prime minister.
US officials said they would look at ways of encouraging peace moves at
talks with the UK, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union in Bonn
today. The possibilities included efforts to arrange an agreement between
the Moslem-led Bosnian government and the Bosnian Croats so as to increase
the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs, and a widening of the Nato ultimatum to
ease conditions in other besieged towns such as Tuzla, Srebrenica or Mostar.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said any ultimatum to help other
cities in Bosnia was 'weeks away' and Nato's priority was to make sure
Sarajevo remained free from shelling.
But a UN official in New York said the UN planned to reopen Tuzla airport on
March 7 in an operation that could involve close air support.
Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said yesterday that France
would ask the UN security council this week to put Sarajevo under UN
administration. It was vital, he said, to build quickly on the success of
Nato's ultimatum.
The need to maintain momentum was echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's
foreign secretary, who was speaking in Paris after talks with Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French premier.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Honda to pull out of cross-share link with Rover: Industrial
collaboration will be wound down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honda, the Japanese carmaker, is to end its minority shareholding link with
Rover in the wake of the controversial takeover by BMW of Germany of a
controlling stake in the UK carmaker.
Industrial collaboration will also be wound down, but co-operative projects
already under way may be continued.
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda, and Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
chairman of the management board of BMW, met in Tokyo yesterday for the
first time since the German executive and luxury carmaker stunned Honda
three weeks ago with its Pounds 800m deal to buy British Aerospace's 80 per
cent stake in Rover.
Honda said after the 90-minute meeting that it intended to end its 'mutual
equity holding relationship' with the Rover group, which was taken in 1990.
Honda currently holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover's vehicle operations
(including Land Rover), while Rover holds a 20 per cent stake in Honda of
the UK Manufacturing, the Japanese carmaker's Pounds 370m car and engine
assembly plant at Swindon, Wiltshire.
Honda made clear yesterday that in the long term it intended to wind down
its collaboration with Rover, which dates from 1979, although it left the
way open for existing co-operative projects such as the production of the
Rover 600/Honda Accord and the Rover 200/400/Honda Concerto to be continued.
In a statement, Mr Kawamoto said: 'The series of contracts now existing
between Honda and Rover will be reviewed in future business discussions.
'In the future we intend to create a more independent operation in Europe,
using our own resources,' he added.
In London, Mr John Russell, managing director of Rover International,
emphasised that Rover believed there would be no changes in existing
collaboration agreements or component supply arrangements.
He expected that project HH/Theta, Honda's and Rover's respective
replacements for the current Honda Concerto/Rover 200-400, would also go
ahead as planned. Production has been scheduled to start in the autumn.
Yesterday's meeting in Tokyo, which included Mr John Towers, Rover managing
director, had taken place in a 'friendly' atmosphere, said Mr
Pischetsrieder.
While Honda would not reveal details of the talks, it emphasised that its
decision to sever the equity links had been based on what BMW had brought to
the negotiating table at the meeting.
'This time we listened to what BMW had to say and then told them what our
intention was,' Honda said. Terminating its equity relationship with Rover
was one of several options Honda had been considering until yesterday's
meeting, it added.
BMW said that the 20 per cent cross shareholdings between Rover and Honda's
UK manufacturing subsidiary would be swapped, leaving it in 100 per cent
control of Rover. In addition, it would make a cash payment of around Pounds
30m to Honda under the terms of the original 1990 share exchange agreement.
Mr Tony Woodley, of the TGWU union, said the relationship between Honda and
Rover appeared to be 'dead'.
Meanwhile, Sir Teddy Taylor, the Conservative MP for Southend East, called
on the government to apologise to Honda for the 'scandalous' way it had been
treated.
Sir Teddy commented: 'It seems to me it was scandalous to sell off the
company to this ailing German giant for a small fortune without even
consulting Honda.'
Mr Robin Cook, Labour shadow trade and industry secretary, said the deal
could 'throw up serious problems for the existing Rover model range and will
undoubtedly create problems for the future development of Rover'.
Ministers must ensure 'that Rover and its workforce will not suffer from the
takeover'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Chancellor denies prejudicing defence in arms to Iraq trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke told the Scott inquiry yesterday he was convinced he had
served the national interest by attempting to restrict information on
Britain's intelligence services from the Matrix Churchill trial about the
export of arms to Iraq.
The chancellor, pictured arriving at the inquiry, gave a robust performance.
He insisted that his actions had not prejudiced the defence in the trial and
refused to accept any personal blame.

FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cider activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from Merrydown sent the cider group's shares tumbling 54
to 159p. It also prompted speculation that another drinks group might be
tempted into a bid move. Merrydown blamed a downturn in sales to the
wholesale market.
Analysts, who had been expecting a doubling of profits to around Pounds
3.5m, pulled back to the Pounds 400,000 mark. Although initially hit by the
news, the other two listed cider groups recovered as some market investors
decided that the problems were specific to Merrydown. Taunton finished 7
adrift at 162p, while HP Bulmer declined 5 to 449p.
The regional electricity companies (recs) remained under heavy downside
pressure. Dealers said worries about a potential 40 per cent hit on pre-tax
profits after the distribution review, expected sometime in July, was behind
the slide in the share prices.
On the plus side for the recs, however, were hints that there could be news
later this month of the sell-off of the recs' shareholdings in the National
Grid. These range from 5 per cent to 12 per cent.
The biggest losses in the sector were recorded by Manweb, which dropped 31
to 744p, and London and Norweb, down 27 apiece to 636p and 699p.
Broker recommendations ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures from British
Aerospace helped the shares bounce 5 to 531p, putting it among a handful of
Footsie stocks that moved against the poor market trend.
The group is expected to report a loss because of the inclusion of a Pounds
250m provision, but substantial improvement is expected in the underlying
performance. Strauss Turnbull reiterated its buy recommendation, as did
NatWest Securities.
Sentiment was further boosted by reports that BAe would soon announce a
Pounds 50m property sale, and news that airline Cathay Pacific had firmed up
an order for six aircraft from Airbus Industrie, in which BAe has a 20 per
cent stake.
Anglo-Dutch food giant Unilever slipped ahead of full-year figures due
today, on concern that these might contain hefty restructuring charges.
Speculation has focused on the company's US detergents business, which
operates in a highly competitive market, and in which Procter  Gamble,
Unilever's arch rival, has already disclosed substantial provisions.
Analysts' forecasts for today's profits figures from Unilever range from
Pounds 2.250bn to Pounds 2.325bn. The shares ended 7 off at 1199p.
Shares in Thorn EMI approached their all-time high ahead of today's
third-quarter results as NatWest Securities drew investors' attention to the
group's multi-media potential. In the light of several recent deals in the
sector, the most recent being the Dollars 10bn Paramount deal in the US, the
broker believes Thorn to be undervalued.
Mr Jason Holden, sector analyst at NatWest, said: 'Thorn's music interests
offer prime access to the rapid growth of 'superhighways' in the new
multi-media era. The market has underestimated the potential for a
rerating.' The stock gained 9 at 1138p.
Chemicals leader ICI fell 14 to 760p as a number of analysts repeated their
unenthusiastic views on the company ahead of full-year figures expected on
Thursday. Kleinwort Benson has the stock as a sell and anticipates
fourth-quarter profits of Pounds 65m to give an annual figure of Pounds
305m. NatWest Securities, James Capel and Hoare Govett are similarly gloomy.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo firmed 2 to 681p against the trend as the
closure of the US market, where most of the sellers are congregated, gave
the bulls a chance.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' held steady at 406p ahead of today's full-year
figures. Hoare Govett's forecast of Pounds 1.22bn is at the high end of the
range, but Lehman Brothers, the US house, cut its estimate to Pounds 1.18n
from Pounds 1.21bn because of what it considers disappointing third-quarter
sales.
Wellcome failed to respond to positive reports on its anti-Aids treatment. A
federally financed study found that AZT dramatically reduced the
transmission of the Aids virus from infected mothers to their newborns, a US
newspaper reported. However, Wellcome receded 13 to 643p.
In a sagging property sector, Land Securities retreated 17 to 723p amid talk
of one broker cutting its net asset value forecasts. British Land fared
slightly better, off 4 at 428p, as it announced a deal to buy a 29.9 per
cent stake in Stanhope, the indebted developer. The news lifted Stanhope 14
to 42p as hopes rose that its refinancing discussions with its banks might
be boosted by its British Land link.
One of the market's leading agency brokers was said to have tried
unsuccessfully to place a block of 2m Royal Insurance shares in the market
at 310p. Royal lost 8 at 306p.
BT was weakened by a sell note published by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the
French-owned stockbroker, which forecast a slowing down of the rate of
dividend growth.
CLL said cost-cutting measures at BT 'will be insufficient to offset the
assault on revenues'. BT shares declined 7 1/2 to 441 1/2 p and the 'new'
stock 8 to 323p.
The oil and gas sectors braced themselves for two sets of crucial results
this week with British Gas and Shell both reporting on Thursday.
Action in the stock market concentrated on BP and Shell, with international
funds said to have been switching out of Shell and into BP. The latter have
fallen sharply against the FT-Actuaries All-Share index recently and also
against Shell.
BP closed 2 1/2 up at 363 1/2 p on turnover of 7.1m. Shell fell 8 1/2 to 720
1/2 p on 2.2m traded. The market range of current cost net income for Shell
is said to range from Pounds 740m to Pounds 990m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The paper and packaging sector suffered the effects of a shift in funds
after UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, advised investors to switch
holdings from Bunzl to Bowater. The former dipped 4 to 178p while the latter
resisted the overall market trend to rise 7 1/2 to 483 1/2 p.
The Swiss house argued that, after a fall of 40p over the past month,
Bowater was on an undeservedly low market rating. It told clients that the
company was a recovery stock with long-term growth prospects and had made
acquisitions in 'some above-average growth markets'.
Alternatively, UBS believes that Bunzl's share price has already taken on
board the recovery in paper prices and that the company needs to make both a
rights issue and acquisitions if it is to maintain its premium rating.

FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Support levels regained in spite of
late setback : Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market struggled hard yesterday to hold on to its nearest
support levels as confidence was challenged by a renewed sell-off in
European government bond markets after the strike talks at IG Metall, the
German steel group, took an aggressive turn. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 32.3
down at 3,350.3, having dipped through the support level to touch 3,347.9 as
both stock index futures and UK gilts fell sharply in late dealings.
Trading in the London market was inhibited by the public holiday closure of
Wall Street yesterday and by uncertainty ahead of today's testimony to
Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve Board, when he is
expected to spell out his views on inflationary pressures on the US economy.
UK stocks opened lower but the initial fall of nearly 30 points on the FT-SE
100, leaving the 3,350 level secure for the moment, was reduced to 12 points
when the March future on the index rallied from its early loss.
With the big institutions unwilling to sell stock until Wall Street returns
to normal trading, probably tomorrow, share prices steadied and the market
traded calmly in modest turnover for most of the session. Once again, the
setback in equities reflected a withdrawal of buyers rather than an increase
in selling pressure.
The shock came very late in the day, when the March contract on the Footsie
dropped to around 3,330, a significant discount against the stock market, as
the IG Metall news provoked renewed selling of bonds in Germany and the UK.
The fall was prompted by an extension of earlier losses in British
government bonds which left longer dated issues with falls ranging to around
 3/4 of a point.
The FT-SE 100 Index last traded below 3,350 on December 21, so any further
slide from last night's close will finally wipe out the gains scored in the
surge in the index at the beginning of this year. Interest rate prospects
have been the principal factor in the market.
Traders stressed that uncertainty, rather than bearishness, was the keynote
of the day. This week also offers a heavy list of trading statements from
leading British companies, with Unilever and SmithKline Beecham leading the
way today, and ICI and British Aerospace following later in the week.
Hopes that British base rates can still be reduced soon in spite of the
latest rise in rates across the Atlantic were shaken by the renewed selling
in European bond markets yesterday. 'A steadier trend in bond prices is a
prerequisite for any recovery in share prices,' was the blunt comment from
one leading dealer.
Although the general uncertainty spread across equities yesterday, bringing
a fall of 41.6 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a closing level of
3,983.9, trading volumes indicated no overall threat at present to market
confidence. Seaq volume dipped to 506.1m shares from Friday's 630.9m.
Daily value of retail, or customer, business in equities, which has been
falling away over the past week, stood at only Pounds 1.3bn on Friday, well
below the levels of a fortnight ago, albeit still a satisfactorily
profitable level for the London-based securities industry. Investors remain
convinced that the UK authorities will be able to trim domestic base rates
again shortly and hope that France will set the lead to lower rates in the
near future.

FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed selling of the Footsie futures contract in the closing minutes of
the session cut short attempts at a rally, indicating another sell-off
today, writes Joel Kibazo.
The March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened sharply down at 3,358 but well
above the worst fears. The continued depression in global bond markets,
along with continued fears on US inflation, brought further selling of the
contract and it fell through its recent support level of 3,342.
Although March stabilised at the lower levels over the lunchtime period, it
traded at a discount to cash throughout the session, pulling the underlying
cash market lower.
An attempted rally in the last hour petered out after another retreat in UK
gilts and German bonds brought a further sell-off. March closed at 3,332, a
17-point discount to cash and around 10 points below its fair value premium
to cash of about minus 7. Volume at the official close stood at 14,736 lots.
In traded options, most of the activity was carried out in the index option.
Of the day's total of 35,745, some 14,525 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option
and 6,312 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. British Steel was the busiest stock
option with a total of 4,313 contracts.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on the OMLX, a mere 105 lots were
transacted.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Toronto down ahead of budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada
Toronto was under pressure from weaker Canadian bonds ahead of today's
release of the 1994/95 federal budget.
The TSE 300 Composite index ended 29.3 down at 4,349.0 and declines
outscored advances by 580 to 216. Due partly to the fact that US markets
were closed yester-day, Toronto volume was thin at 43.6m shares.
All but one of the 14 stock groups ended lower. The mining sector fell 2.03
per cent and real estate lost 1.65 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo closed a net 1.7 per cent easier in heavy trading as
investors decided to cash profits in the afternoon session after the
conclusion of the options market settlement earlier in the day, which had
seen shares initially rise.
The Bovespa index was finally 163 down at 9,286. Turnover hit a record high
of Cr873.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) due to the large amount of investors settling
stock options positions.
Foreigners invested a net Dollars 5.47bn in Brazil's capital markets in
1993, almost five times the amount that flowed into the country in 1992,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reuter reports from Sao
Paulo.
This compares with Dollars 1.21bn in 1992 and Dollars 288m in 1991.
According to latest estimates, investment in January was Dollars 1bn, some
four times that which flowed into the country in the same month last year.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Equities react to unexpected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of largely unexpected political and economic developments in Japan,
Europe and the US provided the impetus for equity markets last week.
Most European markets managed modest advances over the week, although Paris,
Amsterdam and Madrid were exceptions, but the FT-Actuaries World index
dipped as sharp falls in south-east Asian markets took their toll.
In Tokyo, a higher yen in the aftermath of the breakdown in trade talks with
the US left equities sinking. Kleinwort Benson, which sees very little
possibility of a trade war, comments: 'The real worry for Japanese equity
markets is that the administration will talk the yen higher. A higher yen
means lower profits. With the market always having been earnings, rather
than interest rate, driven through the current economic malaise, lower
profits mean lower equity prices.'
Conversely, Nomura, which was surprised by the speed and extent of the rise
in the yen, remained bullish on the outlook for the Japanese stock market.
'The impact of an overvalued currency (and possible trade sanctions) and the
full force of domestic reflation could see the trade surplus shrink with
surprising rapidity,' the bank says. 'A further cut in the discount rate in
Japan, and rise in the US, should also help. The pace of corporate
restructuring, moreover, could well accelerate, increasing visibility of a
dramatic profits recovery as and when the recovery gets under way.'
Europe, meanwhile, had interest rates on its mind, although in the event the
Bundesbank's decision to act on Thursday took most analysts by surprise.
UBS notes that after innumerable false dawns the Bundesbank's decision to
lower the discount rate by 50 basis points represented the first reduction
in German official rates since early October.
'The nature of the reduction - lowering the discount rate and keeping the
Lombard rate constant while maintaining the repo rate fixed at 6 per cent -
gives the Buba plenty of room to manoeuvre over the coming months. European
rates are now firmly back on the agenda and a return to last year's 'salami
slice' reductions in the repo rate is now in prospect.'
UBS adds that the German move paves the way for the Banque de France to cut
its rates after its council meeting on Thursday, although perhaps by less
than the German 50 basis points.
'The (French) central bank's continued dogged attachment to relatively high
interest rates remains a source of puzzlement. The central bank alternates
between exchange rate concerns and credibility worries to publicly justify
its obstinacy,' UBS notes.
At the same time, the debate over the relative attractions of Europe and
Asian markets for equity investors continued apace.
A Smith New Court-Gallup poll revealed that 18 per cent of UK fund managers
planned to reduce their exposure to continental European equities - the
biggest negative balance since the survey began in the middle of 1990 - in
favour of Japan, although the broker notes that the worries for Europe
seemed to be mainly short term.
James Capel, however, takes an opposite view, saying that there remained a
huge weight of money to be invested in equities, and while the Far East
needs longer to simmer down and Japan to return to the boil, Europe was
expected to be a major beneficiary.
By the end of last week, attention had turned to the sell-off in US bonds
after bad news on the business outlook and inflation from the Philadelphia
Federal Reserve. European equities and bonds felt the pinch on Friday as
Wall Street tumbled, but investors were adopting a cautious attitude
yesterday, awaiting new clues when Wall Street resumes trading after the
long holiday weekend.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Bullion weakness
pressures gold stocks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg struggled to attract investor interest owing to the closure of
Wall Street, with traders commenting that only weakness in the price of
bullion provided some direction throughout the session.
Sentiment also remained under pressure from the stalled constitutional talks
and further violence at the weekend, when 15 ANC election campaigners were
killed in Natal province.
The golds index lost 40 at 1,862, industrials gained 9 at 5,704 and the
overall index edged down 21 to 4,831.
Both De Beers and Anglos declined R1.50 to R105.50 and R194 respectively. In
golds, Kloof shed 50 cents to R43.25 and Vaal Reefs R12 to R406.
Among the industrial stocks, Barlow Rand dipped 10 cents to R28.50 and SAB
fell by 75 cents to R87.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bond market declines push
shares lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday's free fall in US long bonds gave bourses another bad day, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT returned to the real world, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of
trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt. The big financials, such as
Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner, had studiously ignored a falling bund
market last week, he said, with options expiring on Friday; yesterday they
dropped with the Dax index which closed the session 32.44 lower at 2,119.53,
the Ibis-indicated Dax easing later to 2,108.06.
The Bund future, said Mr Benischek, was the key to the decline; it dropped
87 basis points to 97.24 yesterday after a rough Friday in New York.
Turnover fell from DM9.9bn to DM6.4bn. Story led stocks were clearly
uncomfortable. Metallgesellschaft dropped another DM20.50 to DM175.50 ahead
of today's results conference; BMW, with Honda planning to sell its equity
stake in Rover, fell DM19.50 to DM848, and shed another DM8 after hours on
profit-taking after last week's 8 per cent gain.
Mannesmann, a recent Anglo-Saxon choice on its cellular telephone prospects,
lost DM8.50 to DM428 on the session and another DM4 in the afternoon. PWA,
the papermaker, which had led the market early this year on its cyclical
recovery prospects, fell DM10, or more than 4 per cent to DM228 on a group
net loss of DM240m.
PARIS was disappointed on a number of counts: weakness in the bond market,
lack of a rate cut from the Bank of France and worries over the direction of
Wall Street when it re-opens later today.
On the last day of the account the CAC-40 index lost 36.58 or 1.6 per cent
to 2,215.20.
Turnover was moderate at FFr4.6bn.
Elf Aquitaine continued to fall back in heavy volume, the shares losing
FFr3.80 to FFr415.00.
AMSTERDAM featured a steep fall in Nedlloyd as the market reacted to a
larger than expected convertible bond issue, the shares dipping Fl 3.20 to
Fl 74.80.
The AEX index closed off 1.33 to 425.53.
Unilever, with results due today, and Akzo, which is expected to report
later in the week, both advanced by Fl 2.30, to Fl 227.80 and Fl 215.90
respectively.
MILAN produced some winners as the Comit index lost 4.48 to 684.55 in thin
trading.
Fiat added L15 to L4,965, after a low of L4,880, in spite of protests and
last-minute wrangling which delayed final agreement on a key deal with
unions to shed 16,500 jobs.
Banks saw BCI climb a further L52 to L6,221 ahead of its privatization at
the end of the month; longer term privatization prospects for Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro and recent management changes helped the savings shares
L1,527 or 10.9 per cent higher to L15,540; and Banco di Napoli rose by L195,
or 9.2 per cent to L2,315 on speculation that it could be added to the list
of privatisation candidates.
MADRID, one of the European markets picked out for growth by the strategists
this year, had profits left to take after a gentle decline last week. The
general index tumbled by 7.10 to 338.36 in turnover of Pta25.7bn.
Dealers said that the downtrend was stronger at the end of the day. Banks
and electrical utilities led the way down, with Argentaria Pta230 off at
Pta6,300 and Sevillana Pta29 lower at Pta772.
ZURICH edged lower in quiet trading as weakness in the bond market continued
to weigh on equities. The SMI index shed 28.3 to 2,997.6.
Mr Simon Marshall Lockyer at Kleinwort Benson, who maintains a neutral
weighting on the Swiss market, noted that profit-taking in financials, and
particularly the insurance sector as the reporting season began had
contributed to the flat performance of Swiss market, compared with the FT-A
Europe ex-UK, over the last month. However, a sharp fall in January
inflation to 2.1 per cent suggested that further cuts in domestic interest
rate cuts were possible, although large reductions were more likely
elsewhere, which suggested an end to the trading run in the bank and
insurers.
ISTANBUL resumed a downward course after Friday's advance with a fall of
10.5 per cent in the composite index, which lost 2,024.52 to 17,250.12.
Trading remains volatile, with investors still attracted by high money
market rates: the central bank raised overnight interest rate to 110 per
cent yesterday from 90 per cent.
WARSAW remained confident. In spite of a sharp fall in Bank Slaski, which
lost 8.7 per cent to 4.2m zlotys, the WIG index rose 299 or 1.6 per cent to
a record 19,358.3 in turnover of 3,700bn zlotys.
Last Thursday, Bank Slaski's stockbroking licence was revoked. Late on
Friday, however, the stock exchange said that it would not suspend trade in
the bank; the finance ministry felt that new shareholders had been
penalised, because trading had begun before everyone had registered their
stock.
TEL AVIV dropped as small investors, acting through mutual funds, dumped
stocks into institutional hands following stock exchange investigations into
alleged insider trading and share-price manipulation. The Mishtanim index
lost 11.04 or 4.9 per cent to 214.99.
ATHENS closed 4.9 per cent higher as hopes grew that a peaceful solution to
the Bosnia crisis lay ahead. The general index added 51.82 to 1,119.7 in
volume of 1.8m shares.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo gains 2.3% as Hong
Kong falls

<TEXT>
The yen's fall against the dollar encouraged buying among arbitrageurs, and
the Nikkei 225 average gained 2.3 per cent, recovering the 19,000 level for
the first time in three trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 rose 434.34 to 19,393.94 as the yen fell to the Y105 level on
continued buying of the dollar by the Bank of Japan. The index registered a
day's low of 18,826.68 in the morning before rising to a high of 19,415.14
in the afternoon on index-linked buying.
However, some analysts were ambivalent over a continued rise in share
prices. 'There is not much significance in the rise, since volume was so
low,' said Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel. He thought that the
yen would not weaken much further, and that it could remain at current
levels for at least another month until a decisive breakthrough was made on
trade talks between the US and Japan.
Volume was 220m shares, against Friday's 265m. In spite of a sense of relief
over the yen's weakening, most investors remained inactive. Large-lot buying
by foreign investors, seen during the past month, was also absent.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 12.85 at 1,569.96 and the
Nikkei 300 added 2.55 at 290.51. Advances overwhelmed declines by 661 to
327, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
3.69 to 1,307.11.
Arbitrage buying supported bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan improved
Y10 to Y3,200 and Sakura Bank moved ahead Y20 to Y1,470.
The yen's decline supported export-oriented high-technology shares. Sony
advanced Y80 to Y6,110 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y20 to Y1,720.
Toyota Motor was also strong, rising Y60 to Y1,930, while Honda Motor
appreciated Y40 to Y1,660.
Telecommunications-related stocks gained ground, with buying focused on the
multi-media theme. Nitsuko, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y70 to
Y1,410 and Fujitsu Y26 to Y1,010. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added
Y14,000 at Y914,000.
Sega Enterprises fell Y60 to Y7,220 on continued pessimism over its earnings
following a downward revision in profits last Friday. Pioneer Electronic
slipped Y10 to Y2,570.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 168.20 to 21,264.40 in volume of 41.3m
shares. Roundup
There were mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday, although
Hong Kong's decline was almost mirrored in Australia.
HONG KONG closed sharply lower on institutional selling. The Hang Seng index
fell by 369.43, or 3.4 per cent, to 10,456.45. Turnover slipped to HKDollars
4.3bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.7bn.
Profit-taking was evident in the banking sector, where HSBC Holdings
surrendered HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 116 and Hang Seng Bank receded
HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 70.50.
The property sub-index dropped 791, or 4 per cent, to 18,616, with Cheung
Kong declining HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 43 and Sun Hung Kai Properties
retreating HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 58.
AUSTRALIA was dragged down by sharp falls overseas and weaker futures and
bonds, and fell 2 per cent to its lowest level in a month, the All
Ordinaries index finishing 44.7 down at 2,178.5.
Worst hit were media and some resource stocks, particularly coal. News Corp
fell 40 cents to ADollars 10.08 and the Nine Network 8 cents to ADollars
5.84 as the media index weakened 3.1 per cent.
SINGAPORE moved cautiously higher, with many investors remaining absent
ahead of tomorrow's budget. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 16.60 to
2,350.87.
SEOUL moved upwards for the third consecutive session, helped by activity in
blue chip issues, and the composite index added 13.07 at 946.00.
Kepco, the electricity utility, and Posco, the steel manufacturer, gained
Won800 and Won2,000 respectively at Won31,100 and Won64,200.
TAIWAN eased back in the lowest day's volume seen so far this year. The
weighted index receded 29.93 to 5,783.89 in turnover of TDollars 42.2bn.
MANILA declined in late trading, influenced by the fall in Hong Kong and a
setback in PLDT in New York on Friday.
The Manila composite index shed 39.8 to 3,005.6 in turnover of 779m pesos,
compared with Friday's 1.3bn pesos. PLDT, which lost Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 74 5/8 in New York on Friday, dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,140 pesos.
JAKARTA fell 2 per cent, blaming overall bearish sentiment and increasing
foreign sell orders as the JKSE index dipped a further 11.02 to 543.76.
KARACHI anticipated more foreign buying as it rose on government incentives
for the energy sector, the KSE-100 index closing 26.86 stronger at 2,375.41.
BOMBAY climbed 5.5 per cent, the BSE index ending 214.48 higher at 4,129.52
in expectation of further economic reforms, including fiscal concessions to
industry in the national budget next Monday.
Brokers said that budget rumours included a reduction in corporate taxes,
the raising of tax limits on individual incomes and full convertibil-ity for
the rupee on current account.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Dollar recovers ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday retraced recent losses against the yen, finishing in
London at Y106.25, nearly Y2 up from Friday's close of Y104.30, writes
Philip Gawith.
The lack of any fresh data, and a public holiday in the US, contributed to a
quiet afternoon's trading, but dollar/yen trading in particular was fairly
brisk in the morning.
In Europe the D-Mark traded steadily in spite of the IG Metall engineering
union calling for a strike ballot in one of the regions. The French
government resisted the temptation to ease policy and kept its repo rate
unchanged at yesterday's auction.
A lot of attention will today be focused on Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the US Federal Reserve, who will deliver his biannual Humphrey Hawkins
testimony to congress today.
The most significant move in the markets yesterday was the sharp
appreciation of the dollar against the yen in Asian trading, and later in
Europe. Traders said the dollar's rise had been helped by Bank of Japan
intervention. The US currency reached a high of Y106.80 before closing
moderately beneath that level.
Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said that with US markets closed
because of the President's Day holiday, American banks left stop-loss trade
instructions in London. A number of these were triggered at Y106.10 and the
selling thus triggered had forced the yen down to Y106.80.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said the
strength of the dollar could reflect nervousness ahead of the weekend
meeting of G7 finance ministers meeting in Frankfurt. He added that markets
were wary of a statement emerging whereby other countries agreed to assist
the BOJ in its efforts to stabilise the yen.
Ten days after the failed trade summit in Washington between President
Clinton and Mr Hosokawa no proposals have emerged yet from Japan about how
to curb its large trade surplus with the US. Mr Koichiro Matsuura, Japan's
deputy foreign minister (and chief trade negotiator), said yesterday:
'Prospects for proposals which will lead to agreement are far from certain.'
The D-Mark was weaker against most other European currencies. A firmer start
was cancelled out by fears that industrial unrest in Germany might escalate.
IG Metall, the giant engineering union, yesterday announced that it would
hold a strike ballot in Lower Saxony from March 1 to 3.
The news caused the D-Mark to weaken more than  1/2 pfennig against the
dollar to DM1.7310, but it ended slightly firmer in London at DM1.7275. a
net pfennig down from Friday's close. Analysts said that if anything the
market had overreacted to the news. From an inflation perspective the key
issue is the quantum of the wage settlement and it appears already likely
that there will be no real growth.
Mr Parsons said the dollar was also benefiting from foreign exchange markets
catching up with bond markets, which have taken a view that a further
tightening in US monetary policy is likely.
Sterling was modestly higher against the D-Mark, ending in London at
DM2.5488, after Friday's DM2.5406. Mr Hawkins said this reflected the
general weakness of the German currency and a retreat from the recent
sell-off of the pound, which had been 'fairly aggressive'.
He said the market was using the opportunity to buy back sterling. 'The
underlying fact is that the UK economy is growing substantially faster than
most of continental Europe, and the downside for UK interest rates is also a
good deal less than in those countries,' he added.
The pound closed mildly easier against the dollar at Dollars 1.4755, from
Dollars 1.4788 on Friday.
Attention will shift firmly back to the US today when markets reopen after
yesterday's public holiday. With the recent  1/4 percentage point rise in
the Fed Funds rate having unnerved international bond markets, Mr
Greenspan's comments will be closely watched.
Mr Parsons said that, whereas European markets took the Fed's recent
tight-ening of policy to be a pre-emptive strike against inflation, US
markets had taken it as a sign that the Fed was privy to information showing
inflation to be worse than previously thought. 'You had the bizarre
spectacle of a 25 basis points rise in the discount rate putting 40 points
on bond yields,' added Mr Parsons.
He predicted that the Fed chairman will today try to reassure the bond
market by stressing that the inflation outlook is a healthy one.
The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 200m of
assistance yesterday, in line with its forecast of a similar liquidity
shortage, revised from an earlier Pounds 350m estimate.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard says probe of French
pig aid does not go far enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK agriculture minister Mrs Gillian Shephard yesterday welcomed European
Commission moves to investigate alleged illegal state aid to French pig
producers but said they did not go far enough.
Speaking at the farm council in Brussels, Mrs Shephard said: 'Although the
French authorities announced two schemes, for FFr30m (Pounds 3.5m) and
FFr300m in September and October last year, the commission action appears to
be against only the first scheme.'
Britain's National Farmers' Union, complaining to Brussels last week, said
the French payments were causing the UK pig industry to bleed to death.
Urging swift action by the commission, Mrs Shephard said pig producers
throughout the European Union had suffered for the past year from
oversupply, because of an expansion in pig herds in most member states.
'France is as much to blame as anyone,' she said. 'By introducing its own
national measures, the French government adds to the problems in every other
country, and rewards its own producers who have contributed to the
oversupply and current market difficulties.'
Special aid is not the only form of financial support for continental pig
producers that encourages expansion and puts British producers at a
disadvantage, according to a report by the UK Meat and Livestock Commission.
Corporate tax arrangements are more flexible in Denmark, France and the
Netherlands than in Britain, it says. 'The main areas of flexibility that
could be encouraged in Britain are in the depreciation of capital
investment, the ability to average net income over a three- to five-year
period and the use of tax credits for training.'
Institutions lending to pig farmers see them as a lower risk on the
continent than is the case in Britain, and price stabilisation schemes also
help, the report says.
It adds that 'a striking feature of the Danish, French and Dutch pig
production systems is the degree of producer co-operation, normally
encouraged by respective governments.'
This provides strong links between producers, processors and retailers,
improved power when buying supplies, and an ability to negotiate
advantageous loans. 'Whereas almost 100 per cent of pig production in
Denmark, France and Netherlands is covered by collaborative arrangements,
the coverage for Britain is only about 40 per cent.'
The report says a British ban on the use of sow tethers and stalls in 1999
will bring extra costs for producers compared with their European
counterparts. 'This change is a watershed and may result in major
disinvestment by a significant proportion of the industry,' it concludes.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian tin giant poses
export conundrum - A look at questions raised by Paranapanema's
recently-announced production cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drastic production cuts announced recently by Brazil's Paranapanema, the
world's largest tin company, is not expected not lead to an equivalent
reduction in its exports this year because of purchases of tin ore from
wildcat miners.
Despite Paranapanema's denials, market analysts expect the company to
increase these purchases, particularly if international tin prices continue
to recover.
Paranapanema announced on February 3 that it would cut its production of tin
concentrate by 45 to 50 per cent - from 12,955 tonnes last year to between
6,500 and 7,000 this year - in an attempt to reduce world tin stocks,
conserve its own reserves and push up prices. The company made two cuts of
10 per cent each last year in response to falling international tin prices.
It said the cut would contribute to bringing down world tin stocks from
41,000 tonnes at the end of last year to 22,000 by the end of this year.
The production cut, which Paranapanema says represents about 3.5 per cent of
estimated world tin demand this year, will be concentrated at the company's
Pitinga mine in the Amazon, which has traditionally accounted for more than
90 per cent of the company's production and half of Brazil's.
Ms Adriana Franca, an analyst at the Brazilian subsidiary of London-based
broker WI Carr, says: 'Paranapanema wants to maintain its reserves at its
Pitinga mine until prices are higher and increase its purchases of tin ore
from wildcat miners'.
Mr Arislando Prado, Paranapanema market relations director, said in a
written statement that the decision had nothing to do with the unexpected
resignation of company president Dr Samuel Hanan at the end of last year. Dr
Hanan is still working with Paranapanema as a consultant and resigned as
president for personal reasons, according to the company.
In addition to Pitinga, Paranapanema owns half of the Ebesa joint venture,
which buys ore from wildcat miners at the Bom Futuro site in Rondonia state.
Last year Paranapanema's share of Ebesa production was about 4,000 tonnes.
Ms Franca says she has been told by Paranapanema that its purchases from Bom
Futuro via Ebesa will increase by 1,000 tonnes and she calculates that the
company's exports will therefore be reduced by about 30 per cent. The local
media has also reported Paranapanema's intention to increase purchases from
wildcat miners. However, the company is now denying that any increase is
planned.
Mr Heinz Feldenheimer, a Sao Paulo-based tin trader, says he expects higher
prices to attract more wildcat miners to Bom Futuro and that Paranapanema
will increase its purchases substantially: 'For Paranapanema it makes sense
because they don't have to invest or risk anything, they just buy from the
independent miners'.
Mr Feldenheimer also expects the recovering world tin price to spur
Brazilian companies to export more this year than last, even though its
quota, agreed with the Association of Tin Producing Countries last October,
is lower. Although Brazil is not a member of the organisation it has agreed
to an export quota of 20,175 tonnes this year, compared with 24,000 last
year.
Because of the closed nature of Paranapanema and its dominance of the
Brazilian tin sector, accurate production and export statistics are
difficult to obtain.
The Brazilian Tin Producers Association, whose president is a Paranapanema
official, refuses to comment on the company's cuts and the association says
that it cannot yet release figures for Brazil's tin concentrate exports last
year. However, preliminary data from the association puts last year's
production at 21,000 tonnes, of which 15,000 tonnes was exported - far below
the 24,000 tonne quota.
This raises questions about Paranapanema's stated production of 17,000
tonnes last year, which includes Ebesa production. According to Ms Franca,
98 per cent of the company's production is for export and that would mean
that Paranapanema and its share of Ebesa exceeded Brazil's total tin
exports.
Mr Feldenheimer speculates that the company could have retained stocks last
year because of the low prices, which hit Dollars 4,600 per tonne in
September. Since then the London Metal Exchange three months delivery tin
price has recovered to over Dollars 5,600 a tonne, partly because of the
ATPC agreement, and producers are hoping that it will reach Dollars 6,500 by
the end of the year.
Other tin companies are not expected to increase production to compensate
for Paranapanema's cut, according to Mr Luiz Carlos Bacil, executive
director of Corumbatai Metais. He says his company is operating at half its
600-tonnes-a-month capacity.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia bursts aluminium balloon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium market's balloon was burst yesterday by the Russian official
who single-handedly pumped it up just a week ago.
The metal's three month delivery price climbed to an 18-month peak of
Dollars 1,332 a tonne last week following Mr Vladimir Kalchenko's assurance
on Tuesday that his country's output cuts of 100,000 tonnes under the
multilateral scheme agreed in Brussels last month would grow to 300,000
tonnes by the end of April. But yesterday, Mr Kalchenko, first deputy
general director of producers' group Aluminiy, told the Reuter news agency
in Moscow that Russia was suspending further cuts because it was not
satisfied with other producers' compliance.
The LME price quickly fell to Dollars 1,303.25 a tonne, down Dollars 18.25
on the day, but still more than Dollars 70 ahead of the level ruling at the
time of Mr Kalchenko's original statement.
'We have already cut output by more than one third of what we promised,' the
Aluminiy official said yesterday. 'We will continue only after we see other
world producers doing the same.'
He pointed to the failure of French producer Pechiney to give details on the
size and timing of its promised output cuts as 'an exact example of what we
are displeased with'. Pechiney said on February 10 that it would lower
production temporarily but had not decided where the cuts would be made or
how big these would be.
Some of Brazil's aluminium producers are studying the possibility of
reducing production but so far no new cuts are planned, according to company
officials, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro.
At a meeting of the Brazilian Aluminium Association on Friday, producers
decided against industry-wide cuts and agreed that individual companies
should be responsible for production levels.
'We have not decided whether or not to cut production,' said Mr Carlos
Ermirio de Moraes, director of Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, which
produces 215,000 tonnes of aluminium a year. 'We do not think, however, that
cuts should start with CBA'.
Aluvale, an aluminium holding of state mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio
Doce, was also considering cutting production at its two associated
companies, Valesul and Albras, said Mr Francisco Pitella, the sales
director. But he added that an early decision was not expected.

FT  22 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rise meets resistance -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE prices rose again at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. The May
futures position edged up to resistance at Dollars 1,250 a tonne before
backing off Dollars 1 by the close, still up Dollars 6. Traders said
sentiment was still friendly although some thought the market looked
overbought and that producer selling might be attracted .
The COCOA market cautiously embraced Friday's strong gains in New York,
which were attributed to chart-inspired fund buying. By the close the May
position was Pounds 13 higher at Pounds 932 a tonne, having eased from an
earlier peak of Pounds 937.
Traders said the US jump was primarily a short-covering rally and predicted
more sober gains for London. 'We'll probably consolidate here, we don't have
the spec interest,' one said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact relaunch likely
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa-producing and consuming countries are expected today to launch a new
five-year agreement to bring supply and demand into balance, despite
continuing delays in signing up members.
Delegates at a council meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation
(ICCO) in London yesterday were optimistic that a gathering under United
Nations auspices would put the agreement into force.
The cocoa pact, agreed last July, requires the backing of countries
representing 80 per cent of world exports and 60 per cent of imports.
It appeared yesterday that these thresholds had still not been formally
reached. It was unclear whether Brazil, the second largest producer, had
completed membership formalities, while Italy, Portugal and Ireland on the
consumer side faced procedural delays in ratifying the agreement.
However, countries that have joined have the right to decide under the
sponsorship of the UN Conference on Trade and Development whether to start
the new agreement anyway, pending the arrival of the new members.
The pact, which was due to come into effect last October, will set up
management committees to control output and encourage consumption. Despite
the prospect of a third or even fourth consecutive shortfall in cocoa
supplies, world stocks are around 1m tonnes and the ICCO still has 180,000
tonnes of buffer stock to liquidate. World prices are about Pounds 900 a
tonne, compared with Pounds 2,000 in 1984.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco divisions to have more
autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is to change its management structure
to allow its six divisions more autonomy. The new structure will come into
effect on March 11 when Mr Juan Villarzu takes over as head of Codelco under
the new administration of president-elect Eduardo Frei.
Mr Villarzu has scrapped the post of vice-president for operations, an
intermediary between the Santiago-based headquarters and the managers of the
mining, power and workshop divisions.
'The transformation of Codelco into one of the most profitable large mining
concerns in the world requires rapid and effective decentralisation,' Mr
Villarzu said. He proposed the scrapping of the operations vice-presidency
and the 'immediate creation of an administration council in each of the
divisions, with the consequent strengthening of decision-making at that
level'.
Pressure to streamline Codelco's structure has grown enormously since last
month's metal futures fiasco, in which one Codelco trader is alleged to have
lost the company Dollars 206m. Critics of Codelco argue that its unwieldy
structure and 'giganticism' were partly responsible for the lack of control
over futures operations.
Even before the scandal, Mr Villarzu had emphasised the need to 'modernise'
Codelco through the creation of autonomous divisions. Each unit, including
some of the break-even mines, may eventually be required to operate at a
profit.
Many of Codelco's top executives resigned after the futures trading scandal,
giving Mr Villarzu free hand to bring in an entirely new team.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Beef mountain is down but not
out - More curbs are on the Brussels agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racks of frozen beef stacked in a cold store in east London bear witness to
one of the European Union's more costly and complex schemes to support
farmers. It will spend about Ecu1.38bn (Pounds 1.08) on buying up surplus
beef from farmers this year as part of the common agricultural policy's
intervention system.
Stocks of beef in cold stores across the EU hit a record level of 1.1m
tonnes a year ago, leading to calls for cuts in the beef mountain. The
amount of beef in intervention stores has since more than halved to 430,000
tonnes as a result of CAP reform and increased export opportunities.
But the European Commission believes this is only a short-term respite and
is urging farm ministers to agree further production curbs this year.
Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, recently warned that the drop in
beef stocks has not so much been caused by reform, 'but has to be explained
by the cyclical movement of production'. He fears that the market will not
remain so positive but will move into imbalance caused by over-production in
one to two years.
Mr Steichen is calling for prompt action to make adjustments to the beef
regime in a 'calm' environment 'rather than in an emergency situation as has
all too often been the case in the past'.
His calls are backed by the UK government which wants to trim spending on
beef - the second most expensive support system in the agricultural budget,
beaten only by cereals. The commission is proposing adjustments to beef
premium payments and is hoping that reforms already in place will reduce the
role played by intervention.
'It's days are numbered as a real outlet and we hope it will end up as what
it was always intended to be: a last resort,' a commission official
explains.
Instead of acting as a safety net to keep farmers producing beef, the
intervention system encouraged over-production and the EU still raises far
more beef than it needs. Ireland, for example, produces seven times its own
beef consumption, with about 75 per cent usually going straight to
intervention stores.
'Some farmers were producing heavyweight carcasses that had no commercial
market and were going straight into intervention,' a UK farming official
says.
The irony about the support system is that the beef is often sold years
after it is bought at a price that is not high enough to cover the costs of
keeping it in cold storage - about Pounds 2.30 a tonne each week.
Intervention beef hit the headlines in the UK last year when six-year old
meat turned up at a butcher's shop in Devon. Sensitivity still runs high
over frozen meat and the manager of an east London cold store demands
anonymity for himself and his store even though his beef is a mere 18
months' old. Outside, 'Meat is Murder,' is scrawled on a wall.
CAP reforms are starting to bite into the intervention system and will have
an effect on overall beef production. Intervention prices have been cut by 5
per cent and will be come down by another 10 per cent over the next 2 years.
On top of this, boards cannot buy until the market price falls to 80 per
cent of the intervention price (which is set each year). This level will be
cut to 60 per cent.
At the same time, the EU has set gradually falling ceilings for the amount
of meat that can be bought by intervention boards each year. This year
650,000 tonnes can be put into store, falling to 350,000 tonnes by 1997. It
has also restricted the size of carcasses that can be bought.
The commission can take action on its own to limit further the size of
animals that can be bought by intervention as a way of reducing stocks. But
if the EU's beef regime is to fit in with the requirements of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, farm ministers will have to consider further
reforms such as reducing beef premium payments, cutting export refunds or
further restrictions to intervention as a way of trimming output.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Germany leads continued slide in European
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the wake of Friday's slide, Europe's bond markets continued to tumble
yesterday, led by heavy selling in the German government bond market.
Although US markets were closed for a holiday, traders reported continued
selling by US hedge funds, albeit at a less frantic pace than last week.
Bond traders today will keenly await US Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, weighing his words for hints of
further tightening.
'Everyone is petrified of another tightening,' said Graham McDevitt, bond
strategist with market analysts IDEA.
The slide in European bonds began earlier this month when the Fed surprised
markets with a small rise in rates and bonds have not regained their poise
in spite of last week's round of European rate cuts.
While many observers agree that most European bond markets are now heavily
oversold, investors remain side-lined, awaiting buying opportunities at even
lower levels.
'Markets are so volatile, it would be prudent to let the air clear before
getting back in,' said Mr Richard Woodworth, head of economic and bond
research at Merrill Lynch, 'I would not recommend testing the waters at this
time.'
However, others said the market recovery, when it comes, could be so fast
that buyers might miss the boat.
'When the market does turn around, it'll be an extremely powerful rebound,'
said Mr Karl Haeling, head of Deutsche Bank's futures and options group.
After weakening steadily throughout the morning, bunds were were knocked
sharply lower in the afternoon when Germany's engineering union IG Metall
said it had called a strike vote from March 1 - 3 in the northern state of
Lower Saxony. If approved, a strike could begin on March 7, and could spread
to other parts of northern Germany, the union warned.
Fears of another bad M3 money supply number also put pressure on bunds, with
talk of a January rate of between 7 and 10 per cent - well above the
Bundesbank's target range - rattling the market. German January M3 and
February inflation data should be released this week.
'We are having a bear panic - there are still a lot of sellers with long
positions left from last year's rally, and I see no one who is willing to
buy,' said a senior futures dealer in Frankfurt. 'It's purely psychological
and has very little to do with fundamentals,' he added.
The March bund futures contract closed at 97.49, down 0.69 points on the day
but off its 97.21 intra-day low.
French government bonds also fell sharply, dragged lower by bunds but also
pressured by disappointment that the Bank of France left interest rates
unchanged at its latest repo operation. Traders now are pinning their hopes
on Thursday's repo, which is also the day the French central bank's
policy-making council meets. But given that the Bundesbank left its key repo
rate unchanged last week, some say there is little chance of a French rate
cut.
The March notional bond futures contract on Matif fell 0.64 points to
127.52.
Gilts followed the rest of Europe lower, with the long gilt future dropping
by 1 3/32 points to 114 1/2 , up from its low of 114.
Despite widespread nervousness, most participants appeared confident that
tomorrow's auction of 7 per cent gilts due 2001 will go relatively smoothly.
'Its saving grace is that it's only Pounds 2.5bn and it's partly-paid,' said
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers play safe with floating-rate
note issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of yesterday's supply of new issues in the Eurobond market came in the
defensive form of floating-rate notes (FRNs) as the persistent weakness in
government bond markets deterred issuers and underwriters alike from
committing themselves to fixed-rate offerings.
Officials at the Asian Development Bank were said to be anxiously waiting
for a stabilisation in the markets so they could launch their first offering
of global bonds. The market had expected the proposed Dollars 750m
transaction, which will be jointly led by IBJ International and Salomon
Brothers, to surface tomorrow but now believes it will not appear until
later in the week. The African Development Bank is also likely to tap the
Eurodollar sector for around Dollars 500m when market conditions improve.
Among yesterday's issues, UCB Group, a subsidiary of Compagnie Bancaire of
France, raised Pounds 500m through an offering of mortgage-backed FRNs
through a special-purpose vehicle called Leo 2. UCB performed a similar
securitisation last year. Lead manager JP Morgan said the deal was the
largest offering of sterling-denominated mortgage-backed notes to date.
JP Morgan said the notes sold out quickly as investors were attracted by
their relatively high yields. The discounted margin on the notes with an
average life of 1.4 years is 18 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate while the discounted margin on the notes with an average life
of 5.1 years is 30 basis points over Libor.
Woolwich Building Society also tapped the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds
200m offering of five-year FRNs which yielded 15 basis points over Libor.
Lead manager UBS said the offering injected fresh liquidity into the
sterling FRN market where issuers had called more than Pounds 1bn worth of
paper since the new year.
Elsewhere, Toyota Motor Credit Corp, whose triple-A rating was affirmed by
Standard  Poor's earlier this month, raised SFr150m through an offering of
six-year FRNs. Lead manager SBC said the offering, Toyota's first public
transaction in the Swiss bond market, was targeted at retail investors
interested in intermediate maturities.
The notes, which carry a first coupon of 4 per cent and then Libor minus 20
basis points thereafter, had an issue price of 100 5/8 and were quoted at
minus  3/8 point in the afternoon, within fees of  3/4 point.
The Kingdom of Sweden has appointed a permanent dealer group to its Dollars
10bn debt issuance programme. They are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and
Morgan Stanley, the arranger of the programme.
The Sydney Futures Exchange is planning to list flexible options, a
derivatives product introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange last
year, Reuter reports.
The flexible option was the industry's most successful product launched in
1993 and has been widely accepted by derivatives participants as
complementary to the fast growing over-the-counter markets, the SFE said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Oman fund to invest in Muscat
exchange
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign investment drive into emerging stock markets has begun to focus
on the oil-rich region of the Gulf with the launch next month of a Dollars
45m Oman fund which will invest in the Muscat stock market.
The Oryx Fund will be jointly managed by London-based Blakeney Management
and the Oman National Insurance Company in Muscat.
The fund will be registered in Oman and stock market listings are being
sought in both London and Muscat.
Initially, 51 per cent of the capital will be raised in Oman and the balance
internationally - in line with Omani foreign investment law.
Al Ahlia Portfolio Company in Muscat will manage the Omani issue and Baring
Securities the foreign portion.
The fund will have exclusive access to the Muscat stock exchange, as the
only fund with foreign shareholders, for a minimum of six months.
'The fund will be the first vehicle for non-Arab investors to enter any of
the Gulf stock markets,' says Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Consultants.
Of the six member states of the Gulf Co-operation Council, only Oman and, to
a limited extent, Bahrain permit foreign investors to participate in local
equity trading.
Other Arab bourses allowing non-Arab participants are Morocco, Tunisia,
Jordan and nominally Egypt.
Mr Morland said that the Oryx Fund will eventually expand to include other
emerging markets in the Arab world.
Last year the Muscat stock exchange had a turnover of around Dollars 200m.
It has 62 listed stocks and is capitalised at around Dollars 1.5bn.
This compares with a capitalisation of Dollars 10bn for the United Arab
Emirates stock market and Dollars 50bn for Saudi Arabia, both of which are
closed to foreign investors.
Oman is going through a period of rapid economic change. The government is
diversifying the economy away from the oil sector and promoting non-oil
commercial activities.
A widespread programme of privatisation of state holdings and an opening-up
of the economy to outside investment also aim to boost private sector
activities.
Oman's trading links with Iran and good political relations with other
neighbouring countries, including Iraq, place Muscat in an ideal position
for rapid growth.
'It is a classic emerging market story,' says Mr Morland.

Foreigners invested a net Dollars 5.47bn in Brazilian capital markets in
1993, almost five times the inward flow in 1992, Reuter reports from Sao
Paulo.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) said capital inflows under the
Annex IV rules, which regulate foreign investment in capital markets,
totalled Dollars 14.6bn, while outflows were Dollars 9.12bn. Brazilian
markets received a net Dollars 1.21bn from abroad in 1992.
The CVM said foreigners invested a net Dollars 1.008bn in January, almost
four times the amount in same month last year.
Of these funds, 82 per cent were invested in stocks, 16 per cent in
debentures, 1.4 per cent in privatisation paper and 0.16 per cent in
fixed-income funds.
Chase Manhattan Bank managed the largest foreign portfolio through Annex IV
with a total Dollars 3.53bn, followed by Banco Garantia, Citibank, Banco de
Boston and Banco Pactual, the commission said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch to trade in gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrill Lynch, the US Securities house which pulled out of dealing in UK
government bonds (gilts) in 1989 after incurring heavy losses, said
yesterday that it had won approval from the Bank of England to start dealing
in gilts again with effect from February 28.
Merrill was one of several foreign houses to pull out of the gilt market in
the late-1980s, a time when the various gilt-edged market makers - known as
Gemms - faced tough competition in an overcrowded market.
Merrill had incurred accumulated losses of more than Pounds 20m (Dollars
29.2m) by 1989, following the Big Bang reorganisation of the gilt market in
1986.
However, conditions in the gilt market have improved dramatically for the
Gemms in recent years: the UK government started to borrow again in the gilt
market, issuing large, liquid gilt issues, and inflation was brought under
control again, allowing interest rates to decline.
Combined operating profits for the Gemms have risen and reached bumper
levels in 1992 and 1993, according to figures compiled by the Bank of
England. While the Gemms made a total operating loss of Pounds 190m between
October 1986 and the end of 1988, combined profits soared to Pounds 64m in
1992 and were Pounds 59m last year.
The more favourable trading environment has encouraged speculation that
other houses may be considering applying for Gemm status. Hoare Govett
recently hired Mr Chris Anthony, a gilt analyst at UBS, leading to
speculation that it would seek permission to set up as a Gemm. Other houses
frequently rumoured to be considering applying for Gemm status include
Chemical Bank, Societe Generale, and Morgan Stanley. After Big Bang, 12
market-makers pulled out of gilts either because the business was no longer
profitable or because they were taken over by another house.

Mr Marineau said that, despite disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings,
the company was on track to 'achieve our target of 7 per cent real earnings

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Consumers' champion in the
Japanese high street - A look at the innovative approach of the leading
supermarket chain's founder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Isao Nakauchi, a blunt talking baseball fan and former street trader, is
doing more than almost anybody in Japan to change people's daily lives.
He is doing so partly as one of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's top
private sector advisers on the government's campaign to sweep away retail
and distribution regulations, to stimulate the comatose economy, and ward
off threatened US trade retaliation.
But Mr Nakauchi, 71, is best known to millions of Japanese consumers through
the profound changes in high street shopping he has pioneered as founder of
Daiei, Japan's only national supermarket chain.
Mr Nakauchi predicts the prices of most goods sold in his supermarkets will
halve, to US levels in dollar terms, but this will take almost 20 years.
Japan's retail market has already become free enough for deregulation to
gain its own momentum, pushed by foreign competition, he believes.
Daiei, which started life as a corner store in 1957, has led a slow campaign
against countless middlemen, suppliers and sometimes bureaucracy, to nibble
away at Japan's notoriously high prices and introduce new ways of shopping.
Its innovations include Japan's first own-brands in 1978 and the first
wholesale warehouse club outside the US, opened in Kobe 18 months ago. While
Daiei is not the heaviest discounter in today's price battles in Japanese
retailing, it led the first rounds of the war.
Its acquisition last year of three regional supermarket chains has speeded
up the rationalisation of Japan's overcrowded retail industry, eroding the
dominance of the small corner store which forms a picturesque but overpriced
staple of urban community life.
Like his shops, Mr Nakauchi's personal style challenges the run of the mill.
The corridor outside his office, for example, is lined with 75 historic cash
registers, instead of the badly hung Impressionist masterpieces usually
found in Tokyo corporate headquarters.
The difference in style expresses a difference in conviction. Unlike most of
his colleagues in the Keidanren business federation, devoted to defending
the interests of big industrial producers, Mr Nakauchi made his fortune by
pursuing consumers' interests.
He got his first job after the war in his father's small town chemist shop,
and founded the first small shop of his own outside a railway station in
Osaka, rather than joining the bottom rung of the salaryman's corporate
ladder, the usual way to the top.
Mr Nakauchi befriended Mr Hosokawa after Daiei bought melons and grapes from
Kumamoto prefecture during the future prime minister's period as governor
there from 1983 to 1991.
Daiei's patronage was a valuable boon to Kumamoto, since the nearly 10,000
stores it owns or manages under its own and other names take a 4 per cent to
5 per cent national market share in most products.
Daiei's turnover of just over Y2,000bn (Dollars 19bn) in the year to last
February, on which it made Y24bn taxable profit, makes it slightly larger
than Sainsbury, the UK supermarket chain.
This might explain why the equally straight talking Mr Hosokawa turned to Mr
Nakauchi for advice on deregulation in the retailing industry.
Mr Nakauchi's report pointed out that Japan's chain stores would save nearly
Y52bn annually if the government scrapped the 42 permits required to open a
supermarket. Why, asked Mr Nakauchi's report, is it necessary to have
separate permits to sell meat, milk, tofu and soft ice cream? Another is
needed to operate a dry cleaning service and yet another to sell
thermometers.
Small shopkeepers have staunchly opposed deregulation since the web of rules
has provided them with valuable protection from competition.
Until recently, they were helped by their ties with the Liberal Democratic
Party, which ran Japan for an unbroken 38 years until its election defeat
last July.
The break-up of the LDP is one factor to lighten small retailers' former
political clout. Another, says Mr Nakauchi, is the ageing of the current
generation of shopkeepers. Unlike Mr Nakauchi's two sons, both senior
managers in Daiei, ambitious young people now see no future in joining their
shopkeeping parents' business, he says.
All this points to dramatic change in the high street. Mr Nakauchi believes
half of Japan's 1.5m shops will go out of business.
It will, in line with his theory of gradual change, be a slow process,
taking until the middle of next century. But it will be inevitable, says Mr
Nakauchi. He cannot see how Japan's retailing industry can sustain twice as
many shops per head - 12 for every 1,000 people - as the US.
Neighbourhood retailers will then broadly divide into supermarkets and
convenience stores, 'so long as they are really convenient,' he says. Daiei
itself neatly captures both sides of Mr Nakauchi's vision of retailing, with
225 Daiei supermarkets and nearly 5,000 Lawson convenience stores.
He dismisses suggestions that the social cost of closing 750,000 shops will
create a backlash. The process will take such a long time, perhaps 50 years,
the lost jobs will be mopped up by service and leisure businesses, Mr
Nakauchi predicts.
Again, the shape of Daiei's own business deliberately reflects this, with
its investments in hotels, consumer finance and even a baseball stadium, to
house Mr Nakauchi's own team, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
Contrary to some other businessmen's attempts to dabble in field sports,
Daiei's baseball projects are turning a healthy profit, despite the
recession and the Hawks poor performance in the professional leagues.
Mr Nakauchi has no plans to export the Daiei formula. His thoughts are more
of learning from foreign retailers. He cites as his models Kmart of the US
and Britain's Marks and Spencer, because of their devotion to value for
money.
He laughs when he is reminded that Baroness Thatcher, the former UK prime
minister, is among Marks and Spencer's customers. Does Mr Hosokawa shop at
Daiei? 'I don't know, but I certainly hope so,' says Mr Nakauchi.

mine property

<TEXT>
Placer Dome, the international gold producer, expects to decide within the
next 12 months whether to press ahead with construction of a gold mine on
the rich Las Cristinas deposit in north-east Venezuela.
The Vancouver-based company said yesterday it had approved a USDollars 13m
feasibility study on the property which, according to initial studies,
contains about 7.7m ounces of gold.
Placer's 70 per cent share of Las Cristinas is equal to almost 60 per cent
of current reserves at its 17 operating mines in North and South America and
Australasia.
Placer also reported a slight drop in 1993 earnings, but a 44 per cent jump
in fourth-quarter income. The latter was largely due to gains from the sale
of investments and favourable tax adjustments.
Earnings for the year were USDollars 107m, or 45 cents a share, down from
Dollars 111m, or 47 cents a share, in 1992. Sales dipped to Dollars 917m
from Dollars 1.02bn.
Placer's share of gold output totalled 1.83m ounces, down from 1.95m ounces.
Average cash production costs edged down to Dollars 184 from Dollars 189 per
ounce.

<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, the Italian state engineering group, is considering possible
shareholding links with McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group, according
to Italian newspapers, Reuter reports from Rome.
A spokesman for Finmeccanica's parent Istituto per la Ricostruzione
Industriale declined detailed comment on a report in La Repubblica that the
Italian group was planning to buy a stake of up to 20 per cent in the US
group.
Finmeccanica confirmed that talks were being held but that there had been no
discussion on the size of any possible holding.
The IRI spokesman added that a recent IRI board meeting gave the go-ahead to
Finmeccanica to hold talks with McDonnell Douglas, but declined to elaborate
on the purpose of the negotiations.
Earlier this month, Flight International magazine reported Finmeccanica was
considering buying a 10-20 per cent stake in the US group's Douglas Aircraft
subsidiary.
Finmeccanica last week agreed to buy eight defence and aerospace firms
controlled by Efim, Italy's third state holding group which collapsed in
1992. Finmeccanica is part of the ATR consortium which makes medium-range
commuter jets.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Daiei forges import buying link
with trader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has formed an import buying
partnership with Marubeni, a general trading company, the first tie-up
between a leading Japanese trader and retailer.
Marubeni is to help Daiei, a pioneer in Japan's embryonic discount shopping
industry, obtain access to cheap foreign goods such as food, clothing and
sports goods, for sale in Daiei's stores.
This is the latest stage in the strategy of Mr Isao Nakauchi, Daiei's
chairman, to make use of the yen's strength to pass on discounts to
customers.
Daiei is also understood to be seeking a similar alliance to develop cheap
cosmetics with a Japanese maker of beauty goods.
The Marubeni accord, to take effect from April, is expected to lead to a
more than threefold rise in Marubeni's sales to Daiei to Y100bn (Dollars
959m) in the next two to three years, representing 5 per cent of Daiei's
estimated sales this year. Food will form a large part of the first
transactions, including chicken from China, Brazilian coffee and Alaskan
fish.
This is part of Daiei's continuing efforts to bypass Japan's multilayered
distribution system. The costs imposed by many layers of middlemen
contribute to the fact that Japan's grocery prices are roughly twice US
levels.
A representative basket of 30 goods cost the equivalent of Dollars 138 in
Japan and Dollars 68 in the US at 1992 exchange rates, according to Daiei's
estimates.
However, previous Daiei alliances have sometimes lacked substance, warned Mr
Dean Perry, retail analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.
Last month, Daiei announced a 'broad-ranging' tie-up with Ajinomoto, Japan's
largest food processor, to gain access to low cost domestic and foreign
food.
Overall earnings for the six months to August at the leading Japanese
supermarkets sagged. At the halfway stage Daiei along with other Japanese
stores, such as Ito-Yokado, and Jusco, all suffered declines in profits, and
they were pessimistic on prospects for the full year.
Daiei said last October that its parent pre-tax profit fell 8.4 per cent in
the first half of the year, as a rise in operating costs outpaced a sales
pick-up.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suncrush posts fall in sales
volumes at halfway stage
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suncrush, South Africa's authorised bottler of Coca-Cola and Schweppes soft
drinks, suffered a decline in sales volumes in the half-year to December 31
which was masked at the pre-tax level by a sharp improvement in investment
receipts.
Although sales revenue improved to R317.4m (Dollars 92m) from R296.7m, sales
volumes at the Natal-based company shrank 3 per cent as consumption was
knocked by a company price increase in January last year, added to a 25 per
cent increase in excise tax, the introduction of VAT, sluggish consumer
spending and the impact of township violence on Suncrush's market.
Mr Robin Hamilton, chairman, said Suncrush would expect real growth in
demand in the current six months were it not for the uncertainty surrounding
the country's first non-racial elections in April. He said: 'Question marks
must hang over business prospects around the election, with the probability
of political stayaways hitting consumption of our products and productivity
at our plants.'
Operating income rose to R53.1m from R49.1m before investment income
improved to R5.46m from R2.8m and interest charges declined to R1.2m from
R4.07m. Pre-tax profit jumped to R57.3m from R47.8m. Distributable profit
rose by nearly 30 per cent to R38.1m, equivalent to 25.5 cents against 22
cents a share, after the company's 50-for-one share split in late 1993.
The interim dividend is raised to 4 cents from 3.4 cents.

at Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philippine Airlines (PAL), the national flag carrier, is to carry out senior
management changes for the third time since it was privatised 25 months ago.
The revamp, including the appointment of a new president/chief operating
officer, is being instigated by PR Holdings, the consortium that acquired 67
per cent of PAL at a public auction in January 1992. Mr Carlos Dominguez,
currently chairman and president, is likely to stay as chairman/chief
executive officer, but it is thought the task of overseeing day-to-day
operations will be assigned to a PR Holdings nominee.
No names have been mentioned yet, and the search will have to be
co-ordinated with the government, which owns about 28 per cent.
PR Holdings said that in the nine months to December 1993 unaudited net
profits slumped to just 56.9m pesos (Dollars 1.4m), from 1.17bn pesos the
year before. Revenues had risen by almost 12 per cent but expenses grew by
19 per cent.
PR Holdings is controlled by tobacco-and-banking magnate Mr Lucio Tan, but
owing to his relations with former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the government
had refused to allow him to run PAL directly.
At the time of the auction the consortium was headed by Mr Antonio
Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone and a relative of
former president Mrs Corazon Aquino. Mr Cojuangco, however, failed to raise
enough cash, forcing him to seek the support of Mr Tan.
Mr Dominguez, a former agriculture secretary and bank executive, was picked
a year ago by the government to head the airline, after the resolution of a
squabble over representation in PR Holdings. The quarrel arose after a
discovery that two state banks had put up cash to support PR Holdings'
takeover of PAL.
Although the government continues to support Mr Dominguez, there is
agreement that he cannot cope with both positions. Late last year, Mr Tan
placed a number of his people to key managerial posts.
Over the past few months, Mr Tan has been the subject of state
investigations for alleged tax evasion.
At PAL, Mr Dominguez reported that the big drop in net profits had been due
to higher maintenance costs, particularly after a decision to contract out
to foreign companies the repair of aircraft engines.
If the trend does not change, PAL will suffer its first loss in three years.
Monthly losses had been recorded since September and early estimates for
January, according to PR Holdings, indicate further red ink.

Aberfoyle, the Australian mining company, has passed the interim dividend
and launched an ADollars 82.3m one-for-four rights issue after staying in
the red in the six months to December, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Higher output and improved lead and zinc prices helped the company to a 31
per cent sales boost to ADollars 55.2m (USDollars 39.4m). . Its loss for the
half was reduced to ADollars 2.6m from Dollars A5.8m.
Depreciation provision eased to ADollars 6.9m from ADollars 7.8m and
exploration write-offs fell to ADollars 7.9m from ADollars 8.7m. New shares
will be issued at ADollars 4.35 each.

<TEXT>
United Westburne, the North American plumbing, heating and electrical
equipment wholesaler, plans a CDollars 38m (USDollars 28m) restructuring to
restore profitability, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Westburne, controlled by France's Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, cut back in
1991-92 because of the broad construction slowdown. It cut staff by 1,000
and sold a US division. But recovery has been slow, mainly because of the
construction slump in eastern Canada.
Mr Robert Chevrier, recently appointed chief executive, said 350 jobs would
go and the Burlington warehouse near Toronto closed. A CDollars 18.5m
special charge will be taken to cover the expenses. Other warehouses may be
closed and some transport services contracted out.
He said Westburne would report operating net profit of CDollars 4.5m for
1993 but a final loss of CDollars 29.8m after special charges. In 1992 the
loss was CDollars 10.8m, or 29 cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 2.1bn.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Kersaf first-half profit up 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong performances from its hotel, casino and cinema interests boosted
interim results at Kersaf Investments, the South African-based leisure
group. Pre-tax profit advanced 15 per cent to R233.9m (Dollars 67.7m) from
R202.9m in the half-year to December 31.
Earnings improved 13 per cent to 119 cents a share, but the interim dividend
is increased by only 3 cents to 69 cents, covered 1.7 times against 1.6
times last year.
Mr Buddy Hawton, executive chairman, said the increase in retained earnings
stemmed from 'traditionally inadequate' dividend cover, which needed to be
raised for further investments and to run down long-term debt. He said
Kersaf's focus on the entertainments business left it vulnerable to
political instability ahead of elections in April, hence the need to be
prudent.
In addition, the group's acquisition of the City Lodge hotel chain in
December, settled by issuing new scrip, meant the group would be servicing
more shares. Mr Hawton said it was difficult to be more optimistic than to
predict satisfactory growth by year-end in the current political climate.
The 20 per cent increase in turnover to R1.18bn from R999.6m reflected the
strong interim showing by Sun International, in which Kersaf has an 80 per
cent stake.
Operating profit rose to R256.7m from R210.7m, before a rise in net
borrowing costs to R22.8m from R7.8m. Income from associates improved to
R42.5m from R36.8m, and after-tax profit climbed to R224.1m from R189.5m.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: CSR puts ADollars 45m into
Chinese venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CSR, the Sydney-based building products and sugar group, is investing
ADollars 45m (USDollars 32m) in a new Chinese joint venture which will
supply pre-mixed concrete in northern China.
It is the first time the Australian company has made a major commitment to
the Chinese market, and its largest foray into Asia to date.
At the outset, CSR will have a 63 per cent interest in the joint-venture
company, to be called CSR Tianjin Readymix, with the government-controlled
Tianjin Building Materials Supply General Corporation holding the minority
interest. The Australian company will make an initial investment of ADollars
23m.
However, when a second stage of the expansion programme is completed in
approximately three years' time, CSR's stake will have risen to 75 per cent,
and its total investment is expected to amount to ADollars 45m.
The joint venture, to be managed by CSR, will operate a large aggregate
quarry and construct four pre-mixed concrete plants close to Tianjin, an
industrial centre in northern China and about 140 kilometres south-east of
Beijing.
It is scheduled to start supplying the market with concrete - most of which
is currently mixed on site in northern China, according to CSR - in August
this year. Within the three-year time-frame, sales are forecast to top
ADollars 70m, and production should top 750,000 cubic metres of concrete a
year. Output from the quarry is expected to treble to 3m tonnes a year.
About 125 concrete trucks should be operational.
CSR is understood to have other Asian projects under consideration.
It recently reached a joint venture agreement to build and operate a
ADollars 29m concrete products factory in Taiwan.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: TNT fills two board positions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transportation group, has filled two of the boardroom
vacancies created by the resignation of six directors last year.
The company said yesterday that Professor Fred Hilmer and Mr Ian Salmon had
been appointed in a non-executive capacity.
The large number of vacancies occurred after Sir Peter Abeles, who played a
major part in building up TNT, resigned from the board after policy
differences. Other directors in the Abeles camp followed suit.
TNT subsequently indicated that all seats might not be filled, and that the
board size would probably shrink.
Professor Hilmer is Dean of the Australian Graduate School of Management in
the University of New South Wales, and also an MBA from the Wharton School
of Finance in the US. He is a former senior partner of McKinsey  Company,
the consultancy firm.
Mr Salmon is managing director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society,
one of the country's largest financial institutions.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Brambles in loss after US
write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A large write-off at its US incineration subsidiary caused Brambles, the
Australian transport, equipment hire and waste disposal group, to post a
ADollars 313.9m (USDollars 223.9m) loss after tax and outside equity
interests in the six months to end-December. In the same period in 1992, it
made an ADollars 88m profit.
Even at the operating profit level, Brambles reported lower earnings, with
pre-tax profits dropping to ADollars 120.9m from ADollars 141.8m. The
equipment services division fell to ADollars 76m from ADollars 93.6m, while
earnings from the waste treatment and disposal side dropped to ADollars
3.81m from ADollars 21.3m.
A more cheerful performance was notched up by the transport services
division, where earnings rose to ADollars 43.4m from ADollars 33.6m. Group
sales were ADollars 1.33bn, against ADollars 1.37bn.
Brambles blamed the 'severe economic downturn in Europe and the structural
changes in the hazardous waste market in the US' for the poor trading
results. The latter problem centres on Environmental Systems Co (Ensco), the
US company that Brambles bought in 1992 after a prolonged acquisition
process. Since then, Ensco, a high-temperature incinerator operator, has
been struggling against competition from cheaper alternatives - notably
cement kilns and industrial furnaces.
Yesterday, Brambles admitted this situation was unlikely to go away.
'Despite representations by the incineration industry to the US
Environmental Protection Agency, there is no evidence at this stage of
pending changes to the regulations,' it said. These, Brambles claims, allow
cement kilns to operate on more favourable terms.
'Although the high-temperature incineration industry might get some relief .
. . in the long term, it is likely that cement kilns will continue to be a
permanent feature of the US hazardous waste market.'
Accordingly, Brambles is writing off the total value of the goodwill arising
from the Ensco acquisition. This and a ADollars 19.6m provision for
rationalisation costs in certain European operations led to a ADollars 377m
abnormal charge.
The company was more optimistic about its equipment rental and transport
activities in continental Europe. These declined sharply in the first half,
but 'there are signs that the worst may be over with the apparent bottoming
of the German economy'. It also noted that, in contrast to the US and
Europe, the Australian interests had generally performed well during the
period.
The company said it expected results to improve during 1994, assuming no
further deterioration in Ensco's performance and continued recovery in
Europe, Australia and the US. It said that it still expected to maintain
dividends, despite the abnormal charges.

sell-off

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The international promotion of the privatisation of Banca Commerciale
Italiana (BCI) has moved to continental Europe and the Far East following a
roadshow in London yesterday for institutional investors.
Pricing of the issue will be set next Saturday in the wake of the
announcement of a 37.8 per cent increase in net profit to L301.2bn (Dollars
180m) last year.
The sharp increase in profitability of the group, controlled by IRI, the
Italian state holding company, was attributed largely to a turnround in the
performance of BCI's Canadian and French subsidiaries.
The results had already been foreshadowed in those of the parent company and
during the road-show in the US.
Net interest income was marginally up at L3,430bn from L3,386bn; while
non-interest income jumped 89 per cent to L2,100bn. With operating costs of
L3,409bn held to a 6.5 per cent rise, group operating profit rose 74 per
cent to L1,901bn from L1,088bn.
The group set aside L853bn for possible loan losses compared with L566bn the
previous year. Pre-tax profits were L1,163bn against L599bn but BCI was
obliged to make substantially increased tax provisions, up from L367bn to
L840bn.
At the year end, the group's total assets stood at L134,106bn compared with
L128,607bn in 1992. Deposits grew 5.7 per cent to L113,657bn while total
cash loans increased 7.5 per cent to L99,232bn.

<TEXT>
The committee representing the creditor banks of Euro Disney, the stricken
leisure group, yesterday received a long-awaited audit of the company's
financial situation from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group.
The report, which clears the way for detailed negotiations between the
banks, Euro Disney and Walt Disney, includes an assessment of the commercial
strategy being pursued by the group.
According to one source, however, the report did not advocate significant
changes to Euro Disney's strategy, drawn up last year, and which includes
greater emphasis on cost controls, increased variation in pricing to smooth
seasonal variations and measures to encourage short-stay visits.
Negotiations are expected to start later this week or next. Walt Disney,
which holds 49 per cent of Euro Disney's equity, has set March 31 for the
conclusion of negotiations. After then, it warned, it would no longer
provide financial support.
The negotiations will focus on how restructuring is to be shared. According
to the report, Euro Disney requires a capital injection of up to FFr13bn
(Dollars 2.17bn) to reduce its FFr20.3bn debts.
Walt Disney is pressing the banks to reduce Euro Disney's debts through the
combination of a rights issue and a debt for equity swap. But Euro Disney's
60 banks want concessions from the US parent company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The DSW, Germany's small shareholder organisation, has called for a special
investigation into the role of the supervisory board at Metallgesellschaft,
in addition to that of the management board.
If shareholders reject an investigation at the special shareholders' meeting
of the troubled metals, mining and industrial group next Thursday, the DSW
would consider going to court to force such a measure, it said yesterday.
At the meeting, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the supervisory board chairman, is to
defend the supervisory board's role in the events leading up to the
dismissal of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive, and other
boardroom colleagues in December.
Mr Schimmelbusch was sacked for allegedly not informing the supervisory
board of developments at MG Corp, the group's US commodities trading
subsidiary. Losses there triggered a liquidity crisis which forced the group
to turn to bankers for a DM3.4bn rescue package last month.
While the supervisory board is likely to agree to an investigation into the
management, it may not want to subject its own decisions to scrutiny. Last
week the DSW said it wanted to examine whether lack of internal controls at
Metallgesellschaft meant it was impossible for the supervisory board to
fulfil its responsibilities.

<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch-based supermarket group which already ranks among the 10
largest food retailers in the US, is to bolster its position in the
south-eastern US by acquiring Red Food Stores from Promodes, the French
retailing group.
Red Food Stores, with annual sales of Dollars 585m, operates 55 grocery
stores in eastern Tennessee and Georgia.
When the deal is completed in late April, it will mark Ahold's sixth
acquisition of a US supermarket chain since it entered the US market in
1977. The latest purchase will lift its annual US turnover by almost 9 per
cent to about Fl 7.25bn (Dollars 3.75bn), representing slightly more than
half of Ahold's total sales.
Ahold declined to give financial details but said the purchase would be
financed out of 'available resources'. In May the company, which has long
been seeking a new US acquisition, raised roughly Fl 450m through a 1-for-10
rights issue.
Away from the US, Ahold has been concentrating its expansion in recent years
on Portugal, where it has bought several grocery and hypermarket chains, and
the Czech Republic, where it is slowly building up the Mana chain.
The acquisition of Red Food Stores fits the pattern of Ahold's earlier US
growth, which has relied on buying supermarkets in contiguous regions to
promote partnerships between its chains and to spread the Dutch company's
presence across the eastern US.
'We see new opportunities for synergy, benefiting both our customers as well
as the bottom line,' Mr Robert Zwartendijk, president of Ahold USA, said.
Red Food Stores' base in Tennessee and Georgia is close to that of Ahold's
Bi-Lo chain, which operates 187 supermarkets in Georgia, North Carolina and
South Carolina.
Ahold's four other US chains cover the eastern US from Virginia to
Massachusetts.

Bikuben, the savings bank, has cut its annual dividend to DKr5 from DKr6 a
share despite moving back into profit after two years of losses.
The group made a pre-tax profit of DKr193m (Dollars 28.7m) last year
compared with a 1992 loss of DKr1.17bn. Financial income increased to
DKr5.54bn from DKr3.67bn and costs were down to DKr2.78bn from DKr2.87bn.
But after bad debt provisions, which rose to DKr2.69bn from DKr1.75bn, there
was an operating loss of DKr132m against a 1992 loss of DKr1.09bn. Only
extraordinary income of DK325m enabled the savings bank to report a small
profit.
Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, chief executive, described the result as 'not
satisfactory'. Total assets increased to DKr100m from DKr95m and the group
said the capital adequacy ratio was 11.1 per cent compared with the Danish
minimum level of 9 per cent.

<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, the German engineering group which owns Mercedes, will discuss
today a possible joint venture with SMH, Swiss maker of the Swatch watch, to
develop a small, economical car.
Mr Roland Klein, Daimler-Benz spokesman, confirmed yesterday that a possible
collaboration between the two companies was on the agenda as the company's
board meets for its usual Tuesday meeting. But he warned that no final
decision was yet in sight.
The 'Swatchmobile' project has been promoted by Mr Nicolas Hayek, SMH
chairman, for several years. Volkswagen was involved, but withdrew in
January last year. Volkswagen said then it was under pressure to cut costs
and wanted to avoid the heavy invest-ment associated with the project.
Speculation that Daimler-Benz would build the long-awaited Swatch car has
recently increased after Mr Helmut Werner, the chairman of Mercedes, said
last week in Frankfurt that his company may team up with Swatch. SMH has
been talking with various carmakers for about a year.
The new two-seater, environmentally-friendly small car would be a welcome
addition to the Mercedes range in the face of increased competition in what
is deemed an increasingly important strategic market segment.
German rival carmaker Volkswagen recently announced that its Audi subsidiary
would build a small car starting in 1996. And BMW is taking control of the
British car producer Rover, which manufactures similar cars.
'Nothing has been decided,' a spokeswoman for Swatch said, adding that the
group would be making no announcement today. Mr Hayek said recently he
expected to name a partner this year.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Spaniards set for record Dollars
300m equity placement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC), a leading and highly
diversified Spanish construction company, is to make the largest ever equity
placement by a private Spanish company.
The bulk of the placement, which could raise more than Dollars 300m, will be
offered to US and UK institutions, with Goldman Sachs, the US bank, leading
the US tranche and co-leading the UK and continental Europe tranche with
Schroders of the UK. Banco Central Hispano will place a smaller tranche
among domestic institutions.
Analysts said FCC's decision could inspire more domestic companies to tap
the markets. Large Spanish corporate placements are usually the domain of
the public sector, the latest being the utility Endesa which announced a
Dollars 1.4bn global offering last weekend.
Some 20 per cent of FCC will be offered to the markets which will raise the
amount of its shares that are freely traded to 40 per cent, one of the
biggest among the domestic construction companies.
The equity being offered is made up of treasury stock, stock owned by FCC's
cement subsidiary Valderribas and a portion of the 74 per cent shareholding
in FCC that is owned by the Koplowitz family.
In addition to its lead management role, Goldman will act as the global
co-ordinator of the placement and the design of the global offering -
private placements on two international tranches, one for the US and one for
the UK and continental Europe, and a third tranche for domestic institutions
 -follows closely the pattern that Goldman established when it brought
Repsol, the state-owned energy group, to the market last year.
The FCC mandate turns Spain into one of the US bank's leading profit
centres. Goldman will be advising Endesa's global offering, which is likely
in May, and it could also place another portion of Repsol equity on the
market after the summer.
FCC is a holding company with divisions covering construction, cement,
property, car parks, waste management, and waste collection and street
cleaning. It shares the leadership of the domestic construction industry
with Dragados y Construcciones, has a 70 per cent quota of the fast growing
waste management sector and is the second largest cement company after
Cemex, the Mexican producer which acquired large Spanish cement companies
two years ago.

FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro sharply ahead at
NKr3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, yesterday reported a
sharp increase in 1993 profits, helped by lower costs, higher crude oil
production and the disposal of the group's 38.3 per cent stake in Freia
Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate producer.
It also plans to spend between NKr600m and NKr700m on expanding its three
PVC plants. If the plan is adopted later this year annual production of the
raw material S-PVC will rise to 400,000 tonnes a year over a four-year
period, from the current figure of 265,000 tonnes.
European capacity is almost 6m tonnes a year, and PVC prices have fared
relatively well in a petrochemical sector dogged by overcapacity in Europe.
Norsk Hydro's net profits in 1993 advanced to NKr3bn (Dollars 403m) -
including a pre-tax gain of NKr2.53bn from the Freia disposal - from
NKr1.8bn in 1992. Excluding the gain, net profit was NKr1.2bn.
The board proposed lifting the 1993 dividend to NKr3.50 a share from NKr3 in
1992. Group operating profit rose by 37 per cent to NKr4.04bn from NKr3bn as
sales increased by NKr4.23n to NKr62.4bn.
'Prices for most of our core products have been very low, but this was
largely offset by a higher exchange rate for the US dollar. The improvement
was due primarily to lower production costs and higher crude oil
production,' Mr Egil Myklebust, president, said.
Hydro said the weak international economy and large exports from the former
Soviet Union have depressed markets and continue to cause uncertainty,
particularly for light metals. Low crude oil prices and continuing
structural problems in the European fertiliser industry also represent
challenges, it added.
Group financial costs last year were cut to NKr1.94bn from NKr2.62bn a year
earlier as foreign exchange losses fell sharply to NKr496m from NKr1.4bn.
For the group's core business segments, agriculture swung to an operating
profit of NKr481m in 1993 from a loss of NKr215m as sales rose by NKr1.5bn
to NKr26.9bn.
The advance was due to significantly lower costs following two years of
restructuring, and higher sales volume in Europe. In 1992 Hydro charged
accounts with restructuring costs NKr160m, but since 1991 costs have been
cut by NKr922m, far above a goal of NKr800m set by the company.
Oil and gas boosted 1993 operating profit by NKr497m to NKr3.15bn as sales
rose by NKr1.41bn to NKr14.1bn. Petroleum production increased by 1.1m
tonnes of oil equivalent to 9.4m, helped by two new fields being brought on
stream.
Light metals, the only one of the group's divisions to suffer a setback, saw
operating profits fall NKr92m to NKr453m as sales rose NKr69m to NKr16.3bn.
Weaker prices for primary aluminium and lower demand for aluminium
extrusions were behind the decline.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MAM's Pounds 5m for venture group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, the fund management arm of SG Warburg, has bought
Grosvenor Ventures, the venture capital company featured in the 1992 BBC
series 'The Adventurers'.
The move is the first outright purchase by one venture capital group of
another but confirms a trend towards a consolidation within the industry as
the raising of funds has become increasingly difficult in the UK.
MAM is understood to have paid about Pounds 5m for Grosvenor Ventures, which
manages Grosvenor Development Capital and four limited partnerships and has
investments of more than Pounds 50m.
The Grosvenor team will remain in the Slough offices and will join MAM's
development capital arm, which manages about Pounds 400m of venture and
development capital investments.
The sale has been expected within the industry since Grosvenor failed to
raise a new fund from investors and the departure of chairman Mr Robert
Drummond after a disagreement over the future direction of the company.
MAM said Grosvenor's business was complementary and that the new owner would
discuss over the coming months the injection of new funds for Grosvenor to
manage.
'They (Grosvenor) have good access to a regional deal flow at the smaller
end of the market for deals of Pounds 750,000 up to Pounds 2.5m which is
what we want them to do,' said MAM's Ms Sandra O'Neill. 'MAM will
concentrate on larger buy-outs from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 30m.'
The announcement of the sale came as Grosvenor Development Capital, the
listed invested trust, which is managed by Grosvenor Venture Managers,
announced its best annual performance since it was listed in 1989.
Net assets increased by 31 per cent to Pounds 15.5m, in the year to 31
December 1993, and assets per share rose to 192.3p.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kynoch rationalises after Pounds 644,000
loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kynoch Group, the specialist manufacturer of healthcare equipment, swung
from profits of Pounds 958,000 to losses of Pounds 644,000 pre-tax for the
year to December 31.
Turnover of continuing activities rose to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 13.3m). There
was also a Pounds 226,000 contribution from acquisitions.
The group warned in September that profits for the year were likely to be
well below those for 1992. For the opening six months they fell by 67 per
cent to Pounds 126,000.
To stem the tide of losses, the group has rationalised its MDH offshoot, to
give cost savings of Pounds 423,000 in 1994.
It has also sold its large capacity steriliser business which was the main
cause of the 1993 deficit.
There were exceptional charges for non-recurring items in 1993 amounting to
Pounds 249,000 (nil). Losses per share emerged at 1.9p (earnings 3.4p).
Looking ahead, Mr John Salkeld, chairman, said trading in recent months had
stabilised and the pattern of demand had begun to improve from the low
levels experienced in the second half of 1993.
Panmure Gordon has agreed to become stockbroker to the group with immediate
effect.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Benefits of new store openings enabled Essex Furniture to raise pre-tax
profits by 14 per cent, from Pounds 619,000 to Pounds 703,000, in the six
months to December 31. Sales at the USM-quoted furniture retailer and
manufacturer grew 44 per cent to Pounds 7.47m.
Mr Michael Franks, chairman, said trading from Boxing Day was ahead of
forecast with excellent input from new locations. Results for the full year
were expected to be 'very satisfactory.'
He reported that the interim performance had exceeded budgeted forecasts and
the company had absorbed the opening costs of a new head office and
distribution facility of five new showrooms in the period.
An additional 60,000 sq ft had been added to selling space and the company
said it intended to open a minimum of five showrooms in 1994.
Earnings advanced from 3.73p to 4.06p and the interim dividend is 1.8p
(1.5p).

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A promise of no jam tomorrow - A look at
Trafficmaster, which is en route for a market quote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing traffic congestion - and offering customers a way of avoiding it -
are key elements in the strategy of a group which will soon come to the
market with a capitalisation of about Pounds 25m.
Trafficmaster is a Luton-based company which claims to offer the world's
first commercially available on-board traffic monitoring system. A
dashboard-mounted screen advises of upcoming traffic jams and road
accidents, in time for drivers to alter their route.
Mr David Martell, chief executive, said Monday mornings were the worst time
to travel on the UK's motorways, while Friday mornings were best in all
parts of the country. He said: 'Cynically, I think this is because salesmen
don't work on Fridays - they play golf.'
Trafficmaster has installed infra-red sensors which monitor traffic speed,
transmit it by radio to a central computer and then feed the information to
visual display units in subscribers' vehicles. The complete network is
updated every three minutes, and advises motorists of the average speed and
direction of any hold-up.
The system already covers more than 1,000 miles of motorways and trunk roads
in the south of England and the Midlands.
Part of the flotation proceeds will be used to extend the network to cover
the main motorways in England, Wales and Scotland by the end of this year,
and main trunk roads during 1995 and 1996.
Trafficmaster units can be rented for Pounds 30 a month, or Pounds 19.50 a
month if purchased. The screens currently cost Pounds 199, but, like other
electronic products, prices are likely to fall rapidly if and when they
start being sold by high street retailers.
Mr Martell, 45, is an accountant with interests in property and wine
shipping. He said the idea for Trafficmaster came to him when sitting in an
M25 traffic jam on the way to Heathrow with an old school friend, Mr Ian
Williams, who is now a non-executive director of the company they founded.
Mr Martell is a fan of motorways and believes some of the critical press
coverage about them is undeserved. However, he was struck by the poor
quality of information about traffic conditions available to drivers.
The company was established in 1988 and, backed by Hambro venture capital
funds, developed the necessary dedicated hardware and software. A pilot
scheme, covering 250 miles of motorways around London, was successfully
concluded in 1992, after which the company was awarded a 12-year licence to
operate the system on all English motorways and trunk roads.
The licence is non-exclusive, and Mr Martell acknowledges that other
organisations might seek to enter the market. However, he believes the
company's investment means it has a four-year technological lead and a
window of opportunity to market its product.
To date Trafficmaster is still incurring trading losses, but has installed
about 2,000 screens. It is close to break-even at that level, but further
investment on extending the network will raise that hurdle. However, once
the network is complete, revenue from each additional subscriber should make
profitability climb quickly.
Trafficmaster said that existing subscribers, which include mainly senior
employees from 55 of the FT-SE 100 companies, report that the system helps
save time, reduces frustration and provides insurance against delay.
There seems little danger of diminishing demand. The Confederation of
British Industry estimates that traffic congestion now costs the UK Pounds
15bn a year. According to Department of Transport forecasts, the number of
vehicles in the UK will grow by 60 per cent by 2020, and road usage will
more than double in the same period.
Trafficmaster has patents pending in 48 countries. In the US - where
Trafficmaster is a registered trade mark - Westinghouse Electric, the US
conglomerate, has signed an exclusive agreement to introduce the system,
probably starting on Washington DC's beltway.
About 20 per cent of current subscribers pay extra to use the system as a
personal pager. A new generation of screens will use 'smart-card' technology
to provide extra services, such as demonstrating each user's position, and
sending local information and routing from motorway sites.
So far the company has installed giant Trafficmaster screens at 20 Welcome
Break motorway sites, with plans for 25 more at ports and airports this
year.
Each site can generate more than Pounds 18,000 from advertising and also
acts as a strong marketing tool to potential subscribers.
The screens have also been installed in the reception area of several
corporate customers, so staff can check road conditions.
The company's big breakthrough to the mass market could come when motor
manufacturers start providing guidance systems in new vehicles. Renault and
BMW are among the car manufacturers working along these lines.
Trafficmaster will be floated by way of a placing, sponsored by Allied
Provincial, to raise about Pounds 5m of new money.
Peek, the quoted electronics group, currently has a 23 per cent stake in the
company, but is not expected to sell any of its shares.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Merrydown shares lose sparkle after warning
on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Merrydown tumbled yesterday after the Sussex-based cider and soft
drinks maker issued a warning on profits and announced plans to restructure
its activities.
The shares were marked down to 125p in pre-market dealings, as analysts
hastily revised their profits forecasts downwards, before rallying to finish
at 159p - still 54p below Friday's closing level.
The board, chaired by Mr Richard Purdey, said that sales in the crucial
Christmas period had been 'very disappointing'. Despite growth from the
repackaged Original brand, the sales outcome for the full year to end-March
was likely to be 'well below previous expectations with a considerable
adverse effect on profitability'.
While the recently acquired Shloer and PLJ brands had maintained sales,
cider was hit, particularly in the bulk cash and carry and wholesale
sectors, reflecting competition from economy brands, the directors said.
The full-year was unlikely to show more than a modest profit, and the level
of the final dividend - 6p last time for a total of 7p - was 'under review'.
The proposed restructuring, aimed at increasing working capital by
concentrating on the company's main brands, would involve a reduction in
stock levels and overheads and the disposal of Martlet Natural Foods and
other 'non-core assets'.
Merrydown's quoted competitors - HP Bulmer and Taunton Cider - both
responded to the statement.
Bulmer, which produces the Strongbow, Woodpecker and Scrumpy Jack brands,
described its trading over Christmas as 'reasonable'. It said its brand
portfolio was more 'balanced' than Merrydown's and stressed that economy
brands accounted for just 5 to 6 per cent of the total cider market.
Taunton, which warned in December that lower-priced brands had adversely
affected the take-home market, said its own trading over the period was
'satisfactory'.
The group, which makes Dry Blackthorn and Autumn Gold and the premium Red
Rock, Diamond White and Brody brands, is launching fresh promotional
campaigns from next month, but declined to make a formal statement on
trading.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth helps Ashtead leap to
Pounds 3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashtead, the plant and machinery hire group which had a Pounds 20.4m rights
issue in November, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.61m to
Pounds 3.26m in the six months to October 31.
Although the shares fell 12p to 439p yesterday, they have been rising
sharply from the 378p level of a fortnight ago.
With organic growth coming from all three divisions, Mr Peter Lewis,
chairman, said that operational gearing of the business - underpinned by
maintained, and even increased, investment across the group throughout the
recession - lay behind the sharp profits rise. During the period, capital
expenditure rose to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.3m) and is expected to be Pounds
8.5m (Pounds 4m) in the second half.
Group turnover advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 16.8m) with
volumes up 24 per cent. Mr Lewis said that further volume growth was the
short-term aim, though there had been sporadic price increases of between 2
and 3 per cent on some lines since last spring.
A-Plant, the core UK plant hire business, raised operating profits to Pounds
2.63m (Pounds 1.47m) on turnover of Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 13.4m).
Ashtead Technology, the offshore services division, lifted profits to Pounds
603,000 (Pounds 489,000) on turnover lower at Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 2.37m)
after the withdrawal from low margin sales programmes. A Singapore branch
was opened in January.
Sunbelt, the US plant hire side, increased profits six times to Pounds
442,000 (Pounds 74,000) on turnover of Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 1.1m). This year
it is spending Pounds 1.3m on plant: next year the figure will be Pounds 3m.
Earnings per share more than doubled from 5.2p to 10.9p and the interim
dividend is raised to 1.3p (1.133p).
COMMENT
At this stage in its development, Ashtead leaves the cynic clutching at
non-existent straws. There will be fewer billings days in the second half -
115 against the first half's 129 - so volume growth will ease slightly. But
even if prices don't firm as they are half-expected to, that will hardly
dent the group's progress, as, apart from anything else, interest charges
will fall as the rights' Pounds 8m cash pile offsets previous borrowings.
The management has steered the group through the recession admirably -
investing heavily, not rushing at fences in the US, using profit-sharing
schemes well - and they can afford to look a little smug. With Pounds 5.5m
pre-tax pencilled in, giving earnings of about 16.5p, the p/e is 26.5. With
no profits decelaration likely at least until 1997, the shares are worth
staying with.

Grand Metropolitan has formed a joint venture to market Smirnoff vodka in
the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
Having seen dramatic growth in Smirnoff sales in Russia, GrandMet's IDV
spirits arm is now keen to attack the Kazak vodka market which is 40 per
cent bigger than the UK.
Mr Paul Curtis, IDV's head of international marketing, said:'Kazakhstan
represents another great opportunity for developing the strength of IDV's
international brands in emerging markets.
'We are uniquely positioned with Smirnoff, which is already available and
well known in some of the major cities.'
He said there was also potential for IDV's other brands which include JB
Rare Scotch whisky.
IDV, which recently secured US distribution rights to Stolichnaya Russian
vodka, has been marketing US-made Smirnoff in Russia since 1989. Last year
it sold 600,000 cases in Russia, compared with just 10,000 cases in 1991. In
June, the Pierre Smirnoff Company set up its own office in Moscow.
The new Kazakhstan company, called IDV Central Asia, is a joint venture with
Coromin Inc, an importer and marketing company with warehousing and
transport facilities.
Unilever has acquired 90 per cent of the shares in Severnoye Siyaniye, a St
Petersburg-based producer of lotions, after-shaves and colour cosmetics.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wills Group, the distributor of fluid handling equipment, reported doubled
pre-tax profits of Pounds 575,000 for the six months to January 1, against
Pounds 287,000.
The result was achieved on turnover up 44 per cent from Pounds 8m to Pounds
11.5m.
Wills also announced a further acquisition with the purchase of Cellar
Services Technology, a Manchester-based supplier to the brewing industry,
for Pounds 60,000.
In the year to May 31 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 64,000 on turnover
of Pounds 1.5m.
The figures were the first to include a full contribution from Platon,
acquired in April last year. At the beginning of November, SRL, based in
Lyon, was acquired helping the French activities to show a good performance.
In Italy buoyant results in some areas balanced downturns inothers. Trading
in Germany and the Netherlands was poor, while in the UK there has been some
sign of improving market conditions but this has yet to show through in
significant increases in demand. Earnings per share improved to 0.36p
(0.28p) basic. or 0.35p (0.24p) fully diluted.
The interim dividend is raised from 0.1p to 0.115p.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bullough restates after shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, has been forced to
restate its full-year results following the discovery of a Pounds 1.4m
shortfall in the assets of a subsidiary.
As a result the group yesterday reported restated audited pre-tax profits of
Pounds 7.78m for the year to October 31 and earnings per share of 2.29p. The
shares closed 12p lower at 161p.
The shortfall was discovered in one of the branches of the group's General
Refrigeration business. Investigations are under way to determine the exact
nature of the loss.
However, the company said that until the investigation was completed it was
not known how much of the loss was represented by the misappropriation of
assets nor how much might be recovered from insurers. A member of the branch
accounting staff had been dismissed.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software in US link-up - Venture
gives distribution access to 45,000 prospective customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based accounting software company
which joined the main market last year, has secured distribution in North
America for its principal product through an innovative revenue sharing
venture.
The deal has been signed with Global Software, a US accounting software
house based in Raleigh, North Carolina. The venture gives QSP access to
45,000 prospective customers - the UK market for large scale accounting
software is only about 3,000 customers.
At no cost it gives QSP a 5 per cent equity stake in Global with the option
to purchase a further 5 per cent at a later date.
QSP and Global will share both software licence fee and maintenance revenues
from QSP's new client-server accounting software, Universal Olas.
Analysts were enthusiastic about the deal, arguing that it provided QSP with
a low cost and low risk method of entry to the US market.
Sales in the North American market are critical for any software company
with global ambitions but UK companies have a poor record of success in the
US. QSP's share price was unchanged yesterday at 407p.
Mr Alan Mordain, QSP chairman, said the company had been seeking a suitable
US partner for two years and had been encouraged by the similarity of
approach between the two companies. The Global management, which recently
bought the company from Hathaway Corporation, had powerful incentives to
make the relationship work, he said.
QSP has been successful in the UK with a mainframe accounting package, but
is pinning its future hopes on Universal Olas, developed for client-server
systems at a cost of some Pounds 12m.
Client-server systems are increasingly taking over from mainframe computers
in large companies and could represent half of all installed systems by
1998.
Global, with revenues of Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) in 1993 and over 1,000
customers in the US, including Federal Express and the American Hospital
Association, is a competitor to Dun  Bradstreet Software and Computer
Associates of the US, and SAP of Germany in mainframe software, but has no
client-server software.
Mr Thomas Roberg, Global's vice president, said that without the QSP deal
the company would have had to develop its own client-server product.
QSP now has 10 customers for Universal Olas and has completed all the
principal modules.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Prior makes second cash call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's Beazer Estates subsidiary is taking a 3.5 per cent stake in Prior,
the property group and architectural ironmonger, as part consideration for
the sale of two properties in Hull and Liverpool.
Beazer, which has given Prior an option on a further property, has
undertaken not to sell the shares for at least 12 months.
Prior is also buying Bouverie House in London's Fleet Street for Pounds
11.5m from a company controlled by the family trust of Prior's chairman, Mr
James Prior.
It is seeking Pounds 4.55m net through the placing of 108.3m shares at 4 1/2
p. They are being made available to shareholders on 3-for-4 basis. The
shares were suspended last week at 7 1/4 p. The company also announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.02m (losses Pounds 467,000) for the six months
to September 30 as a result of the placing in May, which raised Pounds 2.37m
net, allowing a release of bank indebtedness of Pounds 2.05m. Turnover was
Pounds 609,000 (Pounds 596,000).
Prior is buying the three properties for an aggregate Pounds 12.7m,
satisfied by the issue of 32.2m shares, Pounds 2.28m cash and a loan of
Pounds 9m from Century Life, which has also been granted an option for up to

Following reorganisation, Conrad, the football clothing, coaching,
consultancy and leather goods group, turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds
23,000 for the six months to end-December, compared with a loss of Pounds
341,000.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Costs and squeezed margins hit FII
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FII, the shoe manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer, yesterday
announced a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.48m to Pounds
551,000.
The fall was due to a squeeze on margins and a series of one-off costs in
the science and footwear divisions.
The interim dividend is maintained at 6p, as forecast in November's profits
warning. Earnings fell from 15.3p to 2.2p per share.
Turnover was 2 per cent higher at Pounds 42m. Mr Monty Sumray, chairman,
said that was largely due to FII's increased share of the UK footwear
market. Sales in that division rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 38m in a
stagnant market, he said.
Pre-tax profits in the division were affected by a Pounds 44,000 exceptional
cost of recalling a defective shoe design and rationalisation charges.
Profits fell by Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.5m.
The shoe business continued to suffer from tight margins, Mr Sumray said,
and there were indications that leather prices were likely to increase.
On the brighter side, the recent decision by the European Union to impose
quotas on Chinese shoe imports 'may help our cause,' said Mr Sumray. The
science division incurred costs of Pounds 650,000 following the cancellation
of a development contract and a product recall during the first half. This
resulted in a Pounds 1.2m pre-tax loss, against a profit of Pounds 200,000
last time.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Govett rises 21% to Dollars 54.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Govett, the fund management and insurance group, reported a 21 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 54.6m (Pounds 37.3m) for the year to
December 31. Profits growth came largely from fund management fees and
investments, after a good year for international equity and bond markets.
The US profile of the group, which has half its assets and employees in the
UK and half in the US, has been helped by gaining a Nasdaq listing last
year. It is seeking a New York Stock Exchange ADR listing.
Funds under management grew by 31 per cent to Dollars 8.5bn, but a large
portion of the Dollars 2bn increase is attributable to the acquisition of
North American Trust Company last August, which has Dollars 1.5bn under
management. Other inflows came from four large new US institutional
accounts, new investment funds, and sales of US mutual funds.
Weekly sales of US mutual funds leapt from Dollars 250,000 to Dollars 10m,
and Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer, said that growth was expected
to continue this year. The group is aiming to increase the US mutual fund
business from Dollars 340m to Dollars 1bn in the near term. Govett has
benefited from US investors' general move to international markets, driven
by low interest rates and poor prospects for US stocks.
Income from fund management improved to Dollars 19.6m (Dollars 15.4m), and
investment income almost doubled to Dollars 18.5m (Dollars 9.7m). The
contribution from the US life assurance and annuities arm slipped to Dollars
18.3m (Dollars 19m), but Mr Whitehead said this did not reflect significant
unrealised gains. Income from development capital dropped to Dollars 4.5m
(Dollars 7m).
A share buy-back programme contributed to the improved fully-diluted
earnings per share figure, up 38 per cent to 62.1 cents.
There is a final gross dividend of 18 cents (14.5 cents), to make a total of
28 cents (24 cents).

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Low  Bonar jumps to Pounds 32m -
Near-fourfold advance helped by restructuring and new subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low  Bonar yesterday announced a near fourfold increase in profits as the
packaging and plastics group reaped the benefits of a wide-ranging
restructuring and contributions from new subsidiaries.
Britain's self-proclaimed market leader in food packaging saw pre-tax
profits climb from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 31.6m in the 12 months to November
30 last year.
Although the 1992 figures were distorted by heavy reorganisation costs in
North America and the closure of its UK non-wovens business, profits before
exceptionals showed a 43 per cent improvement.
Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said the group - which wraps products as
diversified as soap and silage - was now in a dominant position as
manufacturers consolidated orders with a few key suppliers.
'We've got rid of the bits and pieces which were not central and we now want
to grow in our main businesses, particularly in North America and Europe,'
he added.
Of the group's three core areas, packaging showed the sharpest improvement
with a 55.4 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 20m.
The division, representing more than half of group profit, was boosted by
contributions of Pounds 5.3m from its latest acquisitions: Cereal Packaging,
purchased from Kellogg for Pounds 33.5m, and designer CMB Carton Systems,
the packaging equipment company acquired for Pounds 17.4m.
The acquisitions - funded by a Pounds 50.2m rights issue last April -
contributed Pounds 36m to group turnover of Pounds 368.9m (Pounds 307.3m).
Sales of specialist materials improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 82.8m, with
profits ahead 35 per cent at Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.6m).
The input, however, of the plastics division was more modest. Turnover
increased 6.5 per cent to Pounds 52.8m, while profits rose 4.5 per cent to
Pounds 4.84m.
Mr Norman McLeod, finance director, said the division had failed to keep
pace with the other sectors because of the recession in continental Europe,
where profits fell to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 3.8m).
'Nevertheless, we still managed to generate Pounds 25m in cash during the
year and brought gearing down to 8 per cent from 30 per cent,' he added.
Earnings per share rose 31 per cent to 21.77p, compared with 16.56p before
exceptionals in 1992. A proposed final dividend of 7.1p lifts the total to
10p, a 10 per cent increase.
COMMENT
Low  Bonar has begun to make its assets sweat. Having introduced new
management and completed disposals in the UK and North America, it has
improved productivity sharply and cut borrowing. A five-year contract with
Kellogg has also insulated it from the worst effects of supermarket price
cuts. With orders stabilising in Europe and only a 25 per cent exposure to
the consumer packaging business, profits are expected to exceed Pounds 39m
this year on a forward earnings multiple of 16. The shares, up 7p at 407p
yesterday, appear inexpensive.

FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Odds shorten on Racecourse win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racecourse Holdings Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, remains the favourite
to win the race to own Epsom, home of the Derby.
But yesterday Mr Stan Clarke, who has turned round Uttoxeter racecourse from
losses five years ago, confirmed that he was putting in a private bid, along
with Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman of Singer  Friedlander, the merchant
banking and property group, and Mr Andrew Cohen, managing director of
Betterware, the home shopping company.
Also in the running is Sunset + Vine, which makes sports television
programmes.
Epsom is being sold, along with Sandown Park and Kempton Park, by the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, the statutory body that acquired the courses
more than 20 years ago in order to protect them from possible property
development.
All three courses lie within the M25, London's outer ring road. Estimates of
their total value run up to Pounds 30m.
The bids must be submitted to Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank handling
the sale, by the end of this week. The winner is expected to be announced at
the end of March at the earliest.
Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation, the shipping and property company,
which was also shortlisted, said that it would not be submitting a bid.
Also out of the running is the Racehorse Owners' Association, which feels
aggrieved that it did not make the final list. The association, which has
4,500 members, is thought to have put in an indicative bid of well over
Pounds 20m last month.
Mr David Hillyard, managing director of Racecourse Holdings Trust, said his
group had a good track record for managing large racecourses. The trust owns
nine, including Cheltenham and Newmarket, and ploughs all its profits back
into racing.
Mr Clarke, owner of Uttoxeter, said he had served his apprenticeship in
racing over the past five years, turning the course from losses of Pounds
36,000 in 1989 to Pounds 400,000 profits this year.
'We are committed racing men', said Mr Clarke, who sold his housebuilding
business for Pounds 51m in 1986. He believes he can transfer to racing the
management expertise learnt in building up two businesses.
Mr Gerry Buckland, of Sunset + Vine, said the company specialised in sports
and horse racing television programmes, and believed it could use its skills
to enhance the potential of the three courses. 'The Derby has not had the
crack of the whip it might have had', he said.
Meanwhile Mr Bill Gredley, chairman of the Racehorse Owners Association,
feels that the association's bid was unfairly dismissed. Its committee,
which included Mr David Sieff of Marks and Spencer, and Sir Eric Parker,
former chief executive of Trafalgar House, felt the bid timetable, squeezed
between Christmas and March 1, was too tight.
'Nevertheless we put in a very competitive bid and we feel that we need some
answers', Mr Gredley stated.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Co-operation on an
ad hoc basis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Bacchus, Rover's head of collaborative strategy, was in Tokyo
yesterday seeing the corporate umbrella over his Honda projects snatched out
of his hands. He has been Rover's point of contact with Honda as the two
companies worked together over new models and fostered co-operative
manufacturing.
Although Rover and Honda exchanged board members, the arrangements for
collaboration under that level were loose.
Rover never had a group of people who spent all their time collaborating
with Honda. The role of Mr Bacchus was to facilitate contacts whenever they
were needed. And he has been making about 18 trips to Japan every year to
that end.
Another frequent visitor to Tokyo has been Mr Alan Curtis, managing director
of product supply at Rover and responsible for bringing new models to
market. But neither side ever had a permanent presence in the plants or
offices of the other.
At working level the Rover and Honda executives who came into contact most
frequently were the designers and engineers. Rover formed teams to undertake
projects and tasks. When the work was complete the team would be dissolved,
its members moving on to something else.
Practically, the collaboration of the two companies was done on an ad hoc
basis - 'as the need arose - interface at any level,' as Rover put it
yesterday. As an example Rover designers spent considerable time in Tokyo
when they were developing the 600 model.
The changes in Rover's manufacturing processes over the last 15 years have
been helped by a running series of visits to Honda factories, but executives
learned more from the Honda plants in the US than they did from those in
Japan. 'In the US you could see how the Japanese adapted to western
structures,' Rover explained.
The contacts have resulted in a growing network of executives across the two
companies accustomed to co-operating with each other, which has so far been
unaffected by the BMW purchase. 'Many friendships will continue regardless,'
said one Rover executive.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Few fears over other
link-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT, ANDREW TAYLOR and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the breakdown of Rover's relationship with Honda could harm other
Anglo-Japanese joint ventures were played down yesterday by one of the few
other companies to enjoy a cross-shareholding in a Japanese corporation.
Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, said it did not expect
the Rover affair to have a significant affect on its links with Suntory,
Japan's largest whisky distiller and one of the country's biggest private
companies.
Since 1989, Allied-Lyons has been able to take advantage of a 1 per cent
holding in the privately-owned company to distribute its alcohol products in
the fiercely competitive Japanese market.
In turn, Suntory has taken a 4.3 per stake in Allied Lyons - worth about
Pounds 230m at yesterday's market price.
Under the 40-year joint venture agreement, signed in 1989, the two groups
agreed to set up distribution and marketing companies in Japan.
Allied-Lyons owns 51 per cent of the distribution group and 49 per cent of
the marketing company, with Suntory holding the remainder.
The Osaka-based group sells Allied-Lyons' products in its home market, while
the UK company distributes some Suntory products in North America.
Such links are rare because Japanese companies have usually opted for
outright control in the UK, often starting from greenfield sites. Toyota and
Nissan have built their own car plants, for example.
These investors may feel vindicated after the treatment meted out to Honda
but fears of a backlash against Japanese investment in the UK seems unlikely
given the Japanese preference for local ownership.
Most importantly they regard the UK as a vital manufacturing base to break
into European markets. It is unthinkable, therefore, that they might run
away at the first hint of trouble.
The priority given by Japanese companies to employee and trading
relationships with component suppliers has meant that a lot of time and
money has been committed during the last decade to establishing a large
presence in the UK.
In fact, the commitment in many areas is deepening as Japanese manufacturers
have gone beyond seeing the UK simply as a cheap production country and a
way to avoid trade friction when selling into European Union markets.
Komatsu, the construction equipment producer, manufactures hydraulic
excavators for the European market from its factory in Birtley, near
Newcastle.
When the plant began production in 1987 it was producing machines to
Japanese designs. It now has its own UK design team, making Birtley the
first Komatsu overseas plant to manufacture non-Japanese designed models.
Yamazaki, the world's largest producer of computer controlled machine tools,
also began manufacturing in the UK in 1987, supplying European markets. The
range of products built at the Worcester plant is now being expanded to
serve world markets instead of just Europe.
An example of 'high yen effect' is NSK Bearings in Peterlee, County Durham,
which recently secured its first orders from east Asia supplying bearings to
white goods manufacturers in China and Indonesia. These previously had been
supplied by NSK's parent in Japan.
Japanese property and construction companies, which also established wholly
owned operations in the UK, have fared less well. Companies like Kumagai
which bought expensively at the peak of the property market in the late 1980
are now seeking to retrench. But this is for reasons other than a breakdown
of relationships with British partners, as in the case of Honda and Rover.

<TEXT>
A critical question faces Rover Group. How will it survive without Honda's
technology and expertise in the wake of their failed relationship?
Rover has 2,000 design, development and engineering staff. It has the
capability to take a car from first concept on a computer screen to
production, with no outside help. This capability includes the design,
development and production of engines and gearboxes.
Senior Rover executives insist that this capability has not been utilised to
the full during the period of Rover's 15-year partnership with Honda, for
straightforward commercial reasons rather than for any lack of technical
ability.
There is no logic, they maintain, in Rover developing wholly separate
vehicles or powertrains for market slots that can be occupied perfectly
adequately by shared development models enjoying good economies of scale.
And Rover's full technical capability will in any case be amply demonstrated
in new, as-yet secret, models already scheduled for production and in which
Honda has played no part, according to Mr John Towers, Rover's chief
executive.
That such core expertise has been retained by Rover is easily overlooked,
however, given that the UK car maker being sold to BMW appears to have been
so overwhelmingly dependent on Honda.
Two of Rover's key model ranges, the 600 and 200/400 saloons, are the
subject of simple licensing agreements with Honda or are joint developments,
while a key Rover gearbox is also a Honda design made under licence. All the
licence agreements can be terminated by Honda at three months' notice.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, has indicated that BMW will be more
than willing to place some of BMW's own 6,000 engineers at Rover's disposal
as future new model plans develop without Honda.
'6,000 BMW engineers? - I don't know what we'd do with them,' said one Rover
executive yesterday. 'We are fully capable of seeing through our new car
projects.'
Where Rover executives and engineers, many of whom regret the loss of Honda
as a long-term partner, do see major benefits in BMW's ownership is in the
finan-cial resources that they expect to be made avail-able.
Currently Rover spends some Pounds 200m a year on new model development,
bringing cars into production and upgrading or maintaining plant and
equipment to build them.
This is a very small amount by mainstream motor industry standards, and Mr
Pischetsrieder has indicated that he would expect to see Rover increase it
to at least 7 per cent of its Pounds 4.3bn of annual sales, or slightly more
than Pounds 300m a year.
That would give Rover the ability to bring to fruition various new model
ideas which have been beyond its financial grasp.
'All car makers have more model ideas than finance, and so have to
prioritise what is actually built,' the company said yesterday.
Rover's design, research, development, and engineering facilities are more
extensive than many realise.
They are concentrated at Canley, near Birmingham, and at a vast, 900-acre
complex including 26 miles of test track at Gaydon in Warwickshire.
The Gaydon facility, currently employing 900 engineers and the subject of a
Pounds 100m-plus new building programme, includes: climatic wind tunnels,
prototype build centre, structural analysis facilities, electro-magnetic
compatibility centre to test car computer and wiring systems, component test
laboratories, noise, vibration and harshness analysis centre, engine test
beds and anechoic (sound-free) chambers.
It contains within it the capability to develop engines from scratch. It is
where Rover's state-of-the-art K series multi-valve engine was developed and
which in turn is being developed from a small-capacity four cylinder unit
into a full range of engines, including a V6, capable of powering almost any
vehicle Rover might make in the future.
Commercial logic once again dictates, however, that BMW and other
manufacturers' units are used instead in some applications, such as diesels,
where they can be simply taken 'off the shelf'. Peugeot diesels, for
example, are used in Rover 200, 400 and Metro ranges.
The Canley centre is occupied by some 1,000 designers and engineers, where
vehicles are styled from scratch, and where a master database of dimensions
and other elements is created off which Rover's and component suppliers'
project engineers can work.
However, one of the most valuable benefits Rover has gained from its long
relationship with Honda has been how to break down old barriers between the
various development departments and use simultaneous engineering to bring
products to market more quickly and with many fewer mistakes in the build-up
to production.
Honda has changed Rover's methodology radically, to the extent that new
vehicle projects are not even centred at Gardon or Canley, but at the plant
where they are to be built.
For the 600, for example, a project leader was appointed at the Cowley
manufacturing plant. He appointed a team and they 'lived' within just one
room while ideas for the car took shape. Gaydon and Canley personnel simply
became part of the project team.
It is this Honda-taught approach to development, costs and quality which
allowed Rover to take its Discovery four-wheel-drive model into production
in a record-breaking 21 months and is where, Rover executives acknowledge,
Rover's greatest debt to Honda lies.
Understandably perhaps, Honda is not anxious to see it all handed to such a
fierce rival on a plate.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Government comes
under pressure to intervene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday under pressure from some of its own
backbenchers to encourage Honda to continue its collaboration with Rover.
Angry calls for intervention from Tory MPs are likely to dismay ministers,
who only a few weeks ago were privately expressing relief that Rover's sale
to BMW had not caused a political row.
Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East), said: 'Honda has been treated shamefully.
A minister should now make a public statement saying the government regrets
the way the sale of Rover to BMW has been handled to alleviate the problem.'
Another senior backbencher said the Department of Trade and Industry 'should
start batting for Britain' by encouraging the Japanese to guarantee a
long-term working relationship with Rover.
However, Downing Street dismissed calls for intervention arguing that it was
not a matter for the prime minister.
It was made clear that Mr John Major hopes that co-operation will continue
between Honda and Rover, but does not share the 'apocalyptic vision' of
those who fear a speedy end to the relationship.
However, Mr Simon Coombs, (Swindon) warned that a decision by Honda to sever
all its links with Rover could prove very damaging.
Although Honda stressed that the 2,000 jobs at its plant in Swindon would
not be affected by its decision to sell its 20 per cent Rover stake, Mr
Coombs said an end to joint contracts would affect many of his constituents
reliant on Honda.
He has already asked Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to find out why
there was no British company interested in buying the country's last car
volume manufacturer.
There is deep unease among backbenchers that Honda's decision to sell its
stake in Rover could herald the end of the relationship between the two
companies.
There is also concern that it could harm Britain's chances of continuing to
receive the biggest share of Japanese inward investment in Europe. The UK
accounts for 40 per cent of all Japanese European investment, according to
government figures.
'We now know that Honda are deeply distressed' said Sir Teddy. 'If its not
to have an affect on Japanese inward investment, the government must make a
statement'.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry spokesman, called on
ministers to live up to their promise that Rover and its workforce would not
suffer from the BMW takeover.
'The danger for Rover is that customers will lose confidence and the
workforce will lose morale if the uncertainty is not ended swiftly,' he
said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Bond markets rattled by US and Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN, TERRY BYLAND and JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's bond markets took another tumble yesterday, rattled by strike
threats from Germany's largest trade union and by the possibility of further
US monetary tightening.
Dealers said most of the selling came from professional traders in the
futures markets, while investors were reported to have remained on the
sidelines.
Although US markets were closed for a national holiday, traders reported
continued selling by US hedge funds, albeit at a less frantic pace than late
last week. Hedge funds - private pools of highly leveraged funds - were big
buyers of European bonds last year and have recently been reported to be
liquidating their holdings.
German government bonds dropped by almost a point after the country's
powerful engineering union, IG Metall, said it had called a strike vote in
Lower Saxony. Fears that a strike would be approved and spread to other
parts of northern Germany were used as an excuse for further selling amid
bearish sentiment.
The sell-off of European bonds began earlier this month when the US Federal
Reserve raised interest rates. Despite last week's round of European
interest rate cuts, bond markets remain dogged by fears that the end of the
global rally has come.
'It's a case of the end-of-cycle blues,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond
strategist at market analysis firm IDEA.
UK gilts fell by more than a point, dragged down by their European
counterparts. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe dropped by 1 3/32
points to close at 114 1/2 , having recovered from an earlier low of 114.
In the UK equity market, the FT-SE 100 index fell 32.3 to 3,350.3, with
losses intensified in late trading after reports of the German strike talks.
Although trading was subdued by the holiday closure in New York, the London
market found difficulty in holding on to the important 3,350 benchmark,
which was briefly lost just before the close of business. Hopes that
domestic interest rates can still be cut remained solid at first but were
bruised later when bond prices weakened afresh.
Other European equity markets eased under the pressure of falling bond
markets and fears of a further decline in Wall Street later today. In
Germany, the Dax index of the 30 most widely traded stocks fell 1.5 per
cent, while in France the CAC-40 index slipped 1.6 per cent.
Today the markets will be listening out for the comments made by Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, to Congress.

FT  22 FEB 94 / British Land buys into Stanhope: George Soros and John
Ritblat have moved to gain control of the Broadgate centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land has acquired 29.9 per cent of the property company Stanhope, in
a deal aimed at giving Mr John Ritblat and Mr George Soros control of the
prestigious office development at Broadgate in the City of London.
The share price of Stanhope rose 14p, or 50 per cent, to 42p, on the
announcement.
The Stanhope stake will be transferred to the Pounds 500m British Land
Quantum Property Investment fund, the joint venture formed last June between
British Land and Mr Soros, the US investor who made massive profits betting
against sterling in the 1992 currency crisis.
British Land hopes to implement a financial restructuring which would leave
the fund with 100 per cent of the Broadgate Centre and the Ludgate office
development in the City, which are valued at close to Pounds 1bn, and leave
Stanhope as an independently managed company.
Stanhope announced in November that it was considering ways to strengthen
its balance sheet. In June 1993, it had negative net worth of Pounds 15.8m,
and its rental income has remained insufficient to cover its debt financing
and overheads.
Stanhope's main asset is its half share in the Broadgate development, next
to London's Liverpool Street station, which cost Pounds 2bn to build and
still carries Pounds 800m debt. Stanhope also holds pre-emption rights over
the remaining stake, which is in the hands of the receivers at Rosehaugh,
which collapsed in December 1992.
The company responded to the announcement with a statement that it intended
'to begin discussions with British Land to seek clarification of its
proposals for Stanhope'. Stanhope, which has been working on restructuring
plans, has been unenthusiastic about the prospect of selling off its prize
assets in their entirety. It said it would 'continue to assess, on their
merits, all the alternatives available to Stanhope, including any proposal
which British Land may make'.
Mr Ritblat, British Land's chairman, said: 'The best case scenario would
that we take out the Broadgate and Ludgate complexes from Stanhope and the
receivers, and we so organise it that Stanhope is solvent and able to return
to doing what it does best.' He wanted Stanhope to remain independent, and
British Land would not request board representation.
The Stanhope shares were part of Olympia  York's 33 per cent stake, which
was taken on by the Bank of Nova Scotia. British Land is paying Pounds 1.64m
cash, and issuing 753,562 new shares at 440.5p, valuing the deal at Pounds
4.96m, compared with the Pounds 124m paid by OY in 1988.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Small price to pay for prime seat: George Soros and John
Ritblat have moved to gain control of the Broadgate centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement that Mr John Ritblat's British Land has bought a stake in
Stanhope, a struggling developer, has turned the spotlight on Broadgate, the
City of London complex which is Stanhope's main asset.
For a small outlay, Mr Ritblat has won a seat at the negotiating table, from
which he intends to gain control of Stanhope's Broadgate assets.
The deal was greeted by analysts as a potentially important deal for British
Land. 'It looks as though John Ritblat is making sure that he either gets
Broadgate through the corporate route, or that he has a ringside seat
whenever it goes up for sale,' said Mr Chris Turner, director of research at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
'This is potentially another big hit by British Land,' says Mr Robert Fowlds
of Kleinwort Benson.
'Mr Ritblat is paying a small amount for potentially a slice of a Pounds 1bn
property.'
It is not yet clear whether Stanhope will play according to Mr Ritblat's
plans, although its alternatives appear limited.
Stanhope also appeared to query the validity of the stake acquisition by
drawing attention to the pre-emption rights belonging to Mr Stuart Lipton,
Stanhope's chief executive, by which he would have first refusal on the
shares that originally belonged to Olympia  York.
If British Land succeeds in achieving its goal, the prize could be a
substantial one.
Stanhope owns a half share of Broadgate Properties, which owns six buildings
in the Broadgate Development, as well as the 600,000 sq ft Ludgate
Development on the western edge of the City of London.
It also has pre-emption rights over the other half, which is controlled by
the receivers of Rosehaugh.
Broadgate was one of the largest developments to be built in the 1980s.
At a ceremony during the building work in July 1986, Lady Thatcher, the
former prime minister, described it as the largest development in the City
since the Great Fire of London in 1666.
The Pounds 2bn development was successful in attracting the financial
services industry as it expanded in the aftermath of 1986's Big Bang. Its
large buildings, constructed to accommodate the computer cabling and
air-conditioning needed by large trading floors, succeeded in persuading a
workforce of some 20,000 to move to hitherto unfamiliar territory north-east
of the City.
Broadgate and Ludgate have been affected by falls in the London office
market, where values have fallen by two-thirds from the peak of the market
three years ago. Half of Broadgate has been sold, and the two are now worth
about Pounds 1bn.
Broadgate was a remarkably ambitious scheme for two small companies. Carried
out in partnership with the British Rail Property Board, it was conceived in
1983 by Mr Lipton and Mr Godfrey Bradman, both property entrepreneurs.
The key for such relatively insubstantial companies to build such a large
development lay in the use of non-recourse loans - commonplace in the US but
new to the UK. These allowed the borrower to confine the security of the
loan to specific assets, rather than the parent company.
Despite Broadgate's success in attracting prestigious tenants, it was not
enough to cushion its developers from the downturn which hit the industry in
1990. Rosehaugh was one of the first large property companies to signal the
coming problems, when it announced a Pounds 125m rights issue in 1990. Its
losses continued to mount and in December 1992 the company was put into
receivership.
Stanhope has struggled on, courtesy of its bankers. Its net assets fell from
Pounds 458m in 1990 to a minus Pounds 15.8m in June 1993. Asset values have
started to appreciate again, but the company has continued to suffer
operating losses and its existence remains contingent on the approval of its
bankers. Several months ago, it began work on a Pounds 160m restructuring
plan, which involved raising new funds and merging with its associate
Broadgate Properties. Analysts expected to see some results last month, but
progress so far has been limited.
British Land said yesterday that it intended to play a role in Stanhope's
restructuring plans. Mr Ritblat said, however, that he was not interested in
gaining control of Stanhope, or even in having board representation. 'Our
objective is to ensure that Stanhope remains independent,' he said. 'We
would not expect to play an active role in the company.'
In his view, the solution to Stanhope's problems is to sell Broadgate and
Ludgate - and in the process offload the large debt they carry.
'We want to stabilise Stanhope and provide some some seed capital. We know
what we want to do,' he said.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Rhone-Poulenc bids for French drug distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday
launched a FFr3bn (Pounds 340m) bid for Cooperation Pharmaceutique Francaise
(Cooper), a private company which is one of France's biggest distributors of
drugs and healthcare products to retail chemists.
The offer was described as 'attractive' by Cooper. It requires the approval
of shareholders, including 3,000 pharmacists who control about 40 per cent
of the equity.
The friendly bid is the first significant strategic move by Rhone-Poulenc
since its privatisation in November last year. It comprises a cash offer of
FFr2,400 per share in Cooper, or an exchange of each Cooper share for 18
Rhone-Poulenc shares.
The proposed deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions by
pharmaceuticals companies seeking to strengthen their presence in
distribution. Last year in the US, Merck bought Medco, a drugs mail order
company, and Gehe of Germany gained control of OCP, Cooper's principal
French rival.
Rhone-Poulenc said the acquisition would strengthen its position in France's
network of pharmacies. 'Cooper has very close links with pharmacies as
supplier and adviser and does business with 90 per cent of the 22,000
pharmacy outlets in France.'
Rhone-Poulenc and Cooper already have commercial ties. Cooper distributes
Doliprane, the paracetamol tablet which is Rhone-Poulenc's biggest selling
drug in France, and the Vaxigrip flu vaccine produced by the company's
Institut Merieux unit.
The offer price of FFr2,400 per share is equivalent to 17.7 times the
earnings per share achieved by Cooper in 1992 and twice the net asset value
of the shares. Cooper, founded in 1907, achieved sales of FFr1.8bn in 1992,
and an estimated FFr2bn last year.
Rhone-Poulenc said it had structured the offer to minimise the impact on its
balance sheet. Last year, the group's net debt was reduced by more than
FFr9bn, from FFr33.7bn to FFr24.1bn.
Rhone-Poulenc said it anticipated about half of the value of the offer would
be represented by the share exchange and there would be no significant
impact on earnings per share. The company's shares slipped yesterday,
however, falling FFr4.7 to FFr140.5.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Former London head of CSFB quits parent board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff, long-time head of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) in
London, has left the Swiss CS Holding financial group 'to pursue personal
and family business interests', according to CS.
Mr Rudloff was one of the leading figures in London's international capital
markets throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He joined CSFB in 1980 and kept it
among the top Eurobond and equity houses in the City.
CS said it 'very much regretted' Mr Rudloff's resignation. No replacement
for him was announced.
His sudden move last March to Zurich to the executive board of CS Holding,
parent company of the whole financial group built around Credit Suisse, took
the financial community by surprise. He too seemed surprised, saying: 'You
can never pre-judge a board in Switzerland.'
His move came amid a drive by CS Holding to eliminate fierce rivalry between
its US and UK investment banking subsidiaries.
Mr David Mulford, a former US Treasury official and a vice-chairman of CS
First Boston in New York, replaced Mr Rudloff as chief executive of CSFB.
Three months later, Mr Archibald Cox, chief executive of the US operations
of CS First Boston, also resigned 'to seek other personal interests'.
It was also a time when the traditional Euromarkets business at CSFB in
London was being eclipsed by that of its thrusting derivatives affiliate,
Credit Suisse Financial Products, run by Mr Allen Wheat.
Mr Rudloff's only responsibility at the CS Holding board was to help Mr
Rainer Gut, chairman, with strategic planning. Friends suggested that while
he was a brilliant strategist, this was an assignment, not a job, and would
not satisfy a man with his energy.
A former CSFB colleague said that he would be very surprised if Mr Rudloff,
who is 53, was about to retire.
Mr Rainer Gut is to retire from the board of Elektrowatt, a Swiss electrical
generating company controlled by CS.
Elektrowatt said that Mr Gut wanted to concentrate on the group's core
financial businesses.

FT  22 FEB 94 / OFT to investigate safeguards in pre-payment of funerals
schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation yesterday into
Britain's growing pre-paid funeral business.
The inquiry follows the collapse last month of a Yorkshire-based company
running a pre-payment scheme and comes amid concern about the lack of
regulation of a business that could attract billions of pounds.
In the US, one funeral in seven is pre-paid, and pre-payment schemes have
won up to 40 per cent of the market in some states.
Pre-paid schemes currently account for 3 per cent of the Pounds 70m-a-year
funeral business in the UK. The OFT estimates 100,000 plans have been sold
and expects the market to expand to 150,000 a year.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the financial
implications of the growth of pre-paid funerals were considerable. If 25 per
cent of the UK's 20 million people over the age of 50 eventually bought
plans worth about Pounds 1,000 each, the funeral companies' funds would be
holding Pounds 5bn.
These funds would not be regulated or safeguarded, he said. Proper
arrangements were needed to cover the appointment and powers of trustees and
the deployment of returns from investing pre-payments. The funds should be
kept separately from shareholders' funds.
It was also important to ensure that elderly and vulnerable people were not
sold over-elaborate schemes they could not afford, and that plans purchased
decades before a person's death were honoured or a refund paid to the
person's estate, Sir Bryan said.
The four main companies providing pre-paid funeral schemes - market leader
Chosen Heritage, Dignity, Golden Charter and CWS, the Co-operative Wholesale
Society - offer a variety of plans ranging in cost from about Pounds 750 to
more than Pounds 5,000. The average cost is Pounds 850 to Pounds 1,200.
The companies believe they already provide many of the safeguards the OFT is
looking for through two voluntary regulatory bodies.
Dignity and Chosen Heritage are members of the National Association of
Pre-Paid Funeral Plans, and Golden Charter and CWS co-founded the Funeral
Planning Council.
Both bodies are working on codes of practice covering pre-paid schemes and
demand that member companies hold pre-paid funeral fees in independent trust
funds with separate custodian trustees.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Embargo against Macedonia illegal, Brussels tells Greece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday branded as illegal Greece's partial trade
embargo against Macedonia and warned that the Athens government risked being
taken to the European Court of Justice.
The warning came as Greece, which holds the rotating EU presidency, found
itself isolated at a European foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.
Ministers deplored Greece's unilateral action against the former Yugoslav
republic and demanded an explanation.
Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, pledged to
submit to Brussels a legal defence of the embargo shortly, and hinted that
it would be based on public security grounds. Mr Hans Van den Broek,
commissioner for external political affairs, is to visit Athens and the
Macedonian capital Skopkje, probably tomorrow and on Thursday.
He will attempt to mediate in the crisis caused by a dispute over
Macedonia's name and use of an ancient Greek symbol, the Vergina, on its
flag.
However, a Brussels official made clear that the commissioner would not
negotiate on the embargo. This was being tackled separately by the
Commission.
Greece last week banned the movement of oil and other goods through the
Greek port of Thessaloniki without informing or consulting its EU partners.
The partial embargo followed the US decision to extend diplomatic
recognition to Macedonia. This move seems to have prompted the Greek
Socialist government to harden its position - even at the expense of
alienating the European Commission and Greece's EU partners.
In Brussels yesterday, the Commission described the trade embargo as an
infraction of the Treaty of Rome providing for the free circulation of goods
inside the European Union.
At the foreign ministers' meeting, there were also signs that Athens' action
has weakened already fragile confidence in the impartiality of the Greek
presidency.

Funeral costs may rise sharply as crematorium managers are faced with
spending up to Pounds 100m in the next few years to meet new environmental

They will also need to burn four to five times as much gas to reach the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land's agreement to buy a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope highlights
how Mr John Ritblat conjures up deals that no one else dreams possible. His
immediate intent appears to be to buy a cheap seat at the negotiating table
to influence Stanhope's restructuring. The longer term goal must be to prise
free the attractive Broadgate and Ludgate developments. Whether that is
possible depends on how well Mr Ritblat can arm wrestle with Stanhope's
bankers. He will have to convince them to take a painfully large debt
write-off to ensure Stanhope's future viability given the company is still
bleeding cash.
Stanhope has been trying to stage a rights issue to recreate its balance
sheet. But that is difficult when the biggest shareholders cannot afford to
inject fresh funds. British Land may hope to underwrite that rights issue in
return for access to Stanhope's assets. But Stanhope's puzzled response to
British Land's approach suggests the negotiations will be tortuous.

FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By the supercharged standards of recent media bids, Granada's offer for LWT
does not appear wildly generous, representing a multiple of a mere 27 times
historic earnings. LWT is trading strongly. There is a natural desire not to
sell out successful management. A higher bid is always possible, especially
if the rules regulating cross-ownership of the media are changed. Such
thinking may yet tempt LWT shareholders to reject Granada's bid.
Stand back from the fray and it is not clear that ITV contractors have a
particularly rosy future. In response to the Broadcasting Act, the cossetted
television industry woke up to commercial reality and cut costs with a
vengeance, fuelling the sector's striking share price gains. But that
process is exhausting itself. Growth will now be harder won through more
advertising and programming sales.
Yet ITV contractors are facing increasingly stiff competition for
advertising from Channel 4 as well as cable and satellite operators. Their
fixed-term franchises represent a depreciating asset. A secondary market for
their television programmes has not yet developed. There is an over-capacity
of production facilities. Mature television companies would be unlikely to
sustain current valuations in the absence of takeover frenzy.
The current wave of bids is being driven by the consolidation that occurs in
any industry when regulation is relaxed. In that process, insiders can
invariably afford to pay more than others due to the cost savings that can
be achieved. No other bidder has emerged to match Granada's terms. That is
perhaps not surprising, given Granada is offering twice the price LWT's
shares were trading at before the bidder took its stake. The real issue is
whether Granada is offering too, much rather than too little. LWT
shareholders should be grateful for its generosity.

FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BMW/Honda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given how angry - and embarrassed - Honda must be, its rebuff to BMW may be
the least that it could decently get away with. Honda's collaborative
strategy in Europe has spectacularly collapsed, while Toyota and Nissan's
self-reliance has been vindicated. Daring to be different and then failing
must be doubly uncomfortable in a country where conformity is an art form.
Honda had to be seen to respond to the slight BAe delivered when it sold
Rover to the cheeky Bavarians. It also views BMW as a serious competitor,
particularly in North America. The prospect of BMW pitching up at Honda's
Swindon plant, displaying its 20 per cent shareholding in Honda UK and
demanding to see the books, must have caused a few sleepless nights in
Tokyo. But if severing equity links marks a clear change of strategic
direction and restores some lost face, commercial realities still demand
some connections. Replacing Rover's engine orders or cutting overheads by
enough to offset the lost volumes would be very difficult, especially given
the deep recession in Japan's car industry. Abandoning the jointly-developed
replacement for the Rover 200/400-Honda Concerto would also be very
expensive revenge.
However painful, the prospect is thus for continued operational involvement
between the two companies. That leaves BMW free to invest in developing Land
Rover and a new small car. Honda, having fallen behind its domestic rivals,
will have to spend heavily on beefing up its European presence. The lessons
of trying to co-operate with short-termist westerners are unlikely to be
lost on the rest of corporate Japan.

FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Unravelling bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something perverse about the weakness of European bond markets.
Inflation is well under control in the main European economies. The
continental recovery has barely started, while in the UK a sizeable output
gap remains. The weak oil price hardly indicates general concern about
inflation. The nervousness obviously reflects worry about the New York bond
market, but that is only part of the story.
There has also been a shift in sentiment among the large US hedge funds,
which until recently have given bond markets an upward momentum of their
own. Their leverage means they cannot afford much capital loss. It was time
for them to start worrying when yields stopped falling at the turn of the
year. The risks became all the greater after the Federal Reserve began to
tighten. Since then, a vicious circle appears to have developed: the more
bond prices fall, the more they are forced to sell.
Such fickle investors may have deluded governments about the ease with which
their deficits could be funded. Now comes the question of who will step into
the breach. Domestic European investors show no real signs of selling, but
they are reluctant to buy bonds yet because, probably rightly, they believe
prices could fall further before the hedge fund sales are absorbed. Once the
immediate storm is passed, judiciously timed cuts in short-term interest
rates would help continental markets. That would encourage investors to
shift out of time deposits, replacing some of the US liquidity which has
evaporated. It would be a pity if the Bundesbank were constrained by a false
concern that the bond market has been sending a message about inflation.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Clarke denies prejudicing trial: Disclosure would have put
at risk intelligence agents, chancellor says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke said yesterday he had served the national interest by
seeking to restrict information on Britain's intelligence services from a
court case involving arms exports to Iraq.
The chancellor told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that while home
secretary he had signed public interest immunity (PII) certificates that
barred intelligence officers from providing certain types of information to
the court in the Matrix Churchill case.
He said he did so after satisfying himself that full disclosure would have
'damaged' Britain's intelligence services and put at risk some of its
operatives.
He told the Scott inquiry: 'Once I decided that this type of information, if
disclosed, would be damaging to the intelligence services and it was not in
the public interest for this to be in the public domain, then . . . I had a
duty, and still think I have, to claim public interest immunity . . . '
Mr Clarke has threatened to resign if criticised in the judge's final
inquiry report. Yesterday, in a characteristically robust performance, he
refused to accept any personal culpability and insisted that the PII
certificates had not prejudiced the defence in the Matrix Churchill trial.
But Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, said that Mr Clarke's evidence
raised new questions about the conduct of other ministers and the
government's legal advisers.
Mr Clarke said he considered that as minister he had discretion as to what
evidence should be covered by the PII certificates. Other ministers and
government lawyers have argued that ministers are obliged to sign such
certificates, and that it is for the attorney-general to decide whether to
sanction them. Mr Clarke said that he had in previous cases argued
successfully against government lawyers.
But he told the inquiry that Mr Michael Heseltine, as trade and industry
secretary, had signed a PII certificate in the Matrix Churchill trial on the
advice of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, that all ministers were
duty-bound to do so.
Mr Heseltine's PII certificates covered advice to ministers from officials,
and communications between ministers. The defence in the Matrix Churchill
trial alleged that the documents proved that three businessmen charged with
breaching rules over exports to Iraq had done so with the approval of
government. One of the businessman had been recruited by the intelligence
services.
The trial collapsed after the defence convinced the trial judge that the
bulk of the documents covered by public interest immunity should be
disclosed. Mr Clarke said he had 'never known' of such an immunity being
sought by a minister to 'seek a conviction of an innocent man'.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Poll vaults and politics: The man who made Mori
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 25 years ago to the day that Mr Bob Worcester, an American with a
background in management consultancy, set out to pioneer 'strategic decision
research' in the UK. Four years later he formed Mori, which today is the
UK's largest independent research company. Tonight, leading figures from
British industry and politics will gather in London to applaud his
achievement.
His mission, in 1969, was to persuade British companies to find out, through
research, what their employees, their shareholders, and the public at large,
thought about them. He originated the mantra: awareness; involvement;
persuasion; action. In the intervening years he has worked for most of the
top hundred companies in the UK; for local authorities; for the government;
and, most famously, for the political parties. He has become, not
unwillingly, the public voice of British market research in general and
opinion polls in particular.
Mr Worcester did not find it hard to attract customers. 'I had three clients
in 24 hours.' He enjoyed an after-glow from former prime minister Harold
Wilson's 'white heat of technology': companies were caught up in the general
enthusiasm for innovation and new approaches to management, especially when
presented by an American who had worked for McKinsey, the US management
consultancy.
By providing British industry with empirical research on changes in consumer
tastes and public attitudes, Mr Worcester can claim a small but significant
part in helping business to respond more effectively to the developing
marketplace over the past 25 years.
If industry has gained so, too, has Mr Worcester. He has rejected all
takeover approaches for Mori and now controls a research company with a
turnover of Pounds 10m, employing 130 full-time staff and another 1,150
part-time interviewers in the field. In 1988 he cashed in on his success by
selling 25 per cent of Mori to 3i, the venture capital group, for Pounds 2m.
Though industry and the government provide the vast bulk of the work, it is
for his research in the political field that Mr Worcester is best known.
This amuses him because 'in an average year political polling accounts for 4
per cent of our turnover; in an election year it is 7 per cent', though his
influence in government is far greater than these figures suggest.
Within a year of his arrival in the UK he had introduced the Labour party to
private polling. He was soon a confidante of Lord Wilson. 'Harold was the
cleverest client I ever had. He got more out of me than anyone before or
since.' Mr Worcester did not always provide the Labour party with good news.
But he was employed for 17 years before becoming a casualty of the shake-up
introduced by Labour's then communications director Mr Peter Mandelson in
the mid-80s. Mr Worcester has since worked for Conservative Central Office,
but most of his energies go into political polling for the media.
Of course, opinion polls can get it wrong, most disastrously at the 1992
general election when the predicted Labour victory failed to materialise. Mr
Worcester has tried to learn from the experience; he has employed a
researcher to find out what went wrong. Mr Worcester's explanation for the
election debacle was that a late shift by voters, worried by Labour's tax
plans and the prospect of a hung parliament, won the day for Mr John Major.
He claims not to have lost a single client as a result of what he describes
as 'a black day for polling'.
Half of Mori's projects now come from the public sector, an indication of
the importance attached by ministers to research. Mr Worcester is currently
working for the Local Government Commission, finding out what people on the
ground want from the proposed re-organisation of local government. On one
recent occasion the commission chose to ignore Mori's findings and, Mr
Worcester says, paid the price when its recommendations were criticised by
the public.
Mr Worcester has survived as technology has advanced. Clients can now be
given data an hour after a questionnaire has been received for evaluation.
But, unlike the US, where most research is conducted by telephone, he
prefers face-to-face interviews because, at least in the UK, they are
cheaper and more comprehensive.
He sees growth abroad, mainly in India, Mexico and Brazil, where he has set
up joint companies. But it is in London that Mr Worcester has made his
greatest mark. Success to date has been based on exploiting relatively
narrow areas of corporate and political research, where he has benefited
from contacts in high places. As the international market research business
matures, he may find it harder to thrive in the bigger pond.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Honda climbs out of the front seat: A look at the end of a
special relationship between the Japanese carmaker and Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Honda took its minority equity stake in the Rover group four years ago,
it was the symbolic value - not the size of the stake nor the financial
valuation - that was crucial.
The 20 per cent holding was the cement in a relationship unique between
Japanese and European carmakers. It made the relationship long-term and set
it apart from any other collaboration the two groups might have had with
other rival carmakers at the same time.
Honda's decision yesterday to sever this equity link is just as crucial, and
just as symbolic. It says that the Honda-Rover special relationship is over.
The cement has crumbled.
When BMW emerged three weeks ago in London as the triumphant buyer of
British Aerospace's 80 per cent holding in Rover, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
BMW chairman, voiced the pious hope that 'in this new scenario Rover Cars
will naturally continue its agreements with Honda in every respect'.
That hope was dashed yesterday.
The ending of the equity link at Honda's insistence removes, too, for the
foreseeable future any thoughts of a grander global alliance between Honda
on the one side and BMW-Rover on the other.
BMW has caused Honda seriously to lose face at home. Honda's European
strategy was different to that of its domestic rivals Toyota and Nissan. As
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, admitted yesterday, the strategy had
been built to an important extent around collaboration with Rover, and is
now in tatters.
At the same time Honda and BMW are potent direct rivals in the world auto
market, particularly in the US, where Honda's separate luxury performance
brand, Acura, competes head-on with BMW. Both have built their brand images
on engineering excellence and high performance with a heavy accent on motor
sport.
Yesterday's events in Tokyo rule out any joint Honda-BMW alliance. What now
must be determined is the pace and manner of the disengagement of the
industrial links between Honda and Rover.
With frostiness, Mr Kawamoto said only that 'the series of contracts now
existing between Honda and Rover will be reviewed in future business
discussions.
'Until now our European strategy has included collaboration with Rover. In
the future we intend to create a more independent operation in Europe, using
our own resources.' The relationship was unmistakeably being reduced to only
a 'series of contracts'.
As far as Mr Pischetsrieder was concerned, yesterday's one-and-a-half hours
of talks had been conducted in a 'friendly' atmosphere. The coldness of Mr
Kawamoto's later public statement apparently came as a surprise to the
urbane BMW boss.
But there can be no excuse for any more surprises. Honda has spelled out its
unhappiness and anger at the takeover of Rover by BMW through the symbolic
cutting of the equity link.
Now it is time for the realpolitik. The most pressing questions are how long
should the Honda-Rover relationship take to disentangle, and how disruptive
should the process be to either party? Rover is now only a pawn in this
process. The decisions will be made in Tokyo and in Munich.
It is in Honda's power to disrupt very quickly a significant part of Rover's
car production, if it were to choose to invoke the three-month termination
clauses of its licensing agreements. These cover products such as the Rover
600 executive car - launched last year and produced at Rover's Cowley,
Oxford, plant; the Rover 400 family car, produced at Rover's Longbridge,
Birmingham, plant; and the Honda PG1 gearbox, which Rover produces at
Longbridge for fitting with its own 2-litre T-series engine in several of
its products.
While Honda so far has restricted itself privately to spelling out the
potential strength of the cards it has in its hands, BMW was at pains
yesterday to insist privately that it expected all Rover's existing projects
with Honda to continue. It would not be in Honda's commercial interest to
abandon them.
A similar view emerged yesterday from the all-important components suppliers
in Europe, which play a vital role in the success of both the Honda and
Rover operations, and which in many cases supply identical parts for the
Honda Concerto-Rover 200/400 and for the Honda Accord-Rover 600. They expect
existing programmes to continue.
'We don't feel unease at the moment, because we think it is highly unlikely
that Honda will enact a Domesday scenario,' said a leading components
supplier. 'But they will take it down over time. There is a lot of money
involved. They will not cut off their nose to spite their face.'
The sister cars Honda Accord and Rover 600 were only launched last year.
While Rover produces the 600 under licence at its Cowley plant, and Honda
produces the Accord at its own Pounds 370m Swindon assembly plant, the
supply programme is closely woven together with a largely identical supplier
base. At the same time, Honda supplies 2.0- and 2.3-litre engines for the
Rover 600 from its Swindon engine plant, while Rover supplies Honda with the
Accord's body panels from the Rover stamping plant at Swindon.
If commercial realpolitik dictates that the present generation Accord-Rover
600 programme is left undisturbed, this alone will ensure that the
Honda-Rover industrial links cannot be severed entirely yet.
More vulnerable to potential disruption could be the so-called project Rover
Theta-Honda HH. This is the new-generation family car Honda and Rover are
developing to replace the present Rover 200/400-Honda Concerto. The project
is already advanced and production is due to begin in the autumn.
Honda Europe said yesterday that many of its suppliers were 'already tooling
up and getting ready' to supply components for the car. Its Swindon plant
has 201 suppliers in Europe and many are also common suppliers to Rover.
'We would be very surprised if Honda pulls out of this programme given the
level of investment that has been made and how close they are to getting it
into production,' said another leading UK components supplier yesterday.
If Honda allows the Theta-HH programme to go ahead - Rover will produce its
version under a licensing agreement - the two companies will be forced to
maintain close ties beyond the year 2000.
The economics of the components supply programme and the economies of scale
also suggest that Honda cannot sensibly drop Rover quickly. Last year Rover
production of its 200/400 version of the current generation car totalled
162,095, compared to production of only 18,406 for the much less successful
Concerto. The new generation cars are likely to have a production ratio of
at least 1 to 4 in favour of Rover.
Other factors also suggest that current Honda-Rover projects - in production
and under development - will continue. The Japanese carmaker is still
relatively weak in Europe. Its total new car sales across 17 markets in west
Europe amounted to only 162,000 last year, giving it a west European market
share of 1.4 per cent compared with the 3.5 per cent of Nissan and the 2.8
per cent of Toyota.
At home, Honda is experiencing serious overcapacity, which could prove
expensive to redress in the middle of recession, where three successive
years of declining sales are sapping the company's finances. In the vital US
market, where the Accord was once all-conquering, the car has been knocked
from its perch as the best-seller. Honda is having to invest heavily in a
much more aggressive marketing campaign to try to halt the decline.
In Europe, Rover always represented a low-cost way into a market where Honda
was weaker than its Japanese rivals. It will now shut the door on the
transfer of technology to Rover, which will have to look to the lessons it
has already learned and to BMW to ensure that it stays on the path towards
becoming a world-class producer. Honda will drop Rover in the long run, but
the UK carmaker may still be able to secure a soft landing until Honda is in
a position to cut all links.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Now Tuzla and Mostar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So far, so good. The shelling of Sarajevo has been stopped. Nato has not
actually launched any airstrikes, but no one should doubt that its threat to
do so was necessary. Perhaps the Russian intervention was also necessary.
Certainly it made it much easier for the Serbs to comply (more or less) with
Nato's ultimatum without loss of face. But without the ultimatum and the
threat Russia would almost certainly not have intervened in this way, and
even if it had done so the Serbs would have been less likely to comply with
Russian requests.
As it is, the ultimatum has had to be interpreted creatively to make it
possible for General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, to certify
compliance. The effectiveness of UN 'control' over weapons remaining within
the 20km-radius exclusion zone is uncertain. UN member states have
lamentably failed to provide General Rose with the 3,000 extra troops he has
requested, thereby continuing the pattern of irresponsibility which has
characterised all previous international 'action' in the former Yugoslavia.
France and Britain, the two leading contributors to the existing UN force
(Unprofor), have smugly refused General Rose's request, suggesting it is for
others to take a share of the burden. However justified this implied
criticism of the US, it is hardly a constructive response, nor is it
calculated to strengthen Atlantic solidarity in the next phase of the
crisis. Both countries should recognise that their national prestige and
interests are now irrevocably bound up with the UN operation in Bosnia. If
the operation fails for lack of manpower they may console themselves by
blaming the US, but it is they who will look most foolish.
Strategic significance
With luck, the ceasefire in and around Sarajevo will now hold, at least for
a time. The Serbs will probably move their weapons to other fronts of
greater strategic significance, such as Brcko and Bihac, where Bosnian
government forces are still in a position to threaten communications between
the Serb-held areas in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia proper. But a ceasefire
does not in itself mean that the siege of Sarajevo is lifted - though that
was Nato's declared objective when it ordered the withdrawal of heavy
weapons.
Likewise, the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would not relieve the
suffering in other parts of Bosnia, including many that the UN has
officially taken under its protection. In two of these (Srebrenica and
Tuzla) specific actions ordered, on pain of airstrikes, by last month's Nato
summit have yet to take place. And even the relief of all these places would
not bring peace to Bosnia as a whole.
Exploit momentum
So it is vital to exploit the momentum of the small success gained in
Sarajevo before it evaporates. General Rose was right to press ahead
yesterday with plans to open roads into and out of the city and to repair
water, electricity and gas supplies. He is right, and should be given the
fullest support by Nato and the UN Security Council, in seeking to extend
the Sarajevo model to other parts of Bosnia. Opening the airport at Tuzla,
through which desperately needed food, medicine and shelter could be brought
to more than 1m civilians in central Bosnia, is an obvious priority. But the
plight of Mostar, which is worse than that of Sarajevo, must not be
forgotten.
The Serbs are not the only villains in this war. It is Croat forces, with
active support from the Croatian regular army, that have destroyed the
historic bridge of Mostar and are still raining down shells on the Moslem
population trapped on the east bank of the Neretva. President Franjo Tudjman
of Croatia, a protege of Germany and the Vatican, has still given no
indication that he will withdraw his troops from western Hercegovina. An
ultimatum to the Croats around Mostar would be amply justified, would
involve fewer political risks than that to the Serbs around Sarajevo, and
would make it easier to maintain Russian support for a policy of firmness
towards the Serbs.
It is good, too, that US and Russian officials are meeting with those of the
EU and UN in Bonn today, to push forward the diplomatic process. Only if the
US, Russia and Germany are very firm in urging concessions on their
respective proteges in Bosnia is there any hope of peace.

OK. So Honda's decision to sever its links with Rover might make life more
difficult for BMW, Rover's new owner. But don't underestimate what attracted
BMW in the first place. Its 3, 5 and 7 series meld perfectly with Rover's 2,
4, 6 and 8 series . . . Sounds like a perfect fit rather than a calculated
gamble.

When John Russell, Rover's international sales chief, looked into the mirror
first thing yesterday morning it was to practise his address to the FT's
London motor conference. What he should have been taking was a crash course
in damage limitation. Before he had even got up to speak, news hounds were
thrusting microphones under his nose. Forget the guff about customer
satisfaction - what did Russell think of the shock news from Japan? 'I felt
like the drama critic who went to describe a play and wound up reporting the
shooting of the president,' says a bruised Russell.

The race is on for the top editorial job at Le Monde, the venerable French
daily paper. Jacques Lesourne, who resigned earlier this month after months
of wrangling over cost-cutting, was the first non-journalist ever to hold
the post of publisher.
Although Lesourne managed to cut Le Monde's heavy losses, he was unable to
tame the paper's rather eccentric team of journalists. No surprise then to
see Le Monde returning to its old form. The two candidates for the top job
are both journalists - Bruno Frappat, editorial director, and Jean-Marie
Colombani, his deputy, who has bid for the post before.
Le Monde wants to avoid a repetition of the six-year-long power struggle
which preceded Lesourne's appointment in early 1991. In the past, the
paper's staff has chosen its candidates in Swiss-style primary elections.
This time the management dispensed with that formality and asked its own
candidates to stand. The journalists will choose between Frappat and
Colombani on March 4.
On past form, the management succession seems unlikely to proceed as
smoothly as the timetable suggests.

BAT Industries doesn't seem to be having much luck hanging on to the
investment chieftains of its Allied Dunbar insurance operations.
First Hugh Jenkins (a Welshman) jumps ship to run the investment side of the
Prudential. Now Ken Inglis (a Scot) is off to rejoin his old countrymen at
Flemings, despite being offered the prize of running the much bigger
combined Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar fund management business.
Surely, a politically incorrect company like BAT can tell its headhunters
that only English fund managers will be considered for the vacant post of
its investment supremo.

Just how far will US President Bill Clinton go to mend fences when he meets
Britain's prime minister next week? After the rows over Ireland and Bosnia,
there is plenty of groundwork in need of urgent repair.
An invitation to sleep for one night in the White House sounds jolly
generous, especially since the last British prime minister to do it was Sir
Winston Churchill. But the US administration's eagerness to rebuild the
special relationship has its limits - notably supporting the UK's nominee
for the head of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
Major put Lord Lawson up for the job, but word is that Washington, which
picks up much of the tab for the Pounds 125,000-a-year post, is preparing to
veto that idea.
The Americans believe that the OECD, after a decade in the hands of the
monetarists, would benefit from a secretary-general who made economic
growth, not obsessive control of inflation, his priority. Clearly no one
told them about the Lawson boom.

Is Merrill Lynch a contrarian indicator for trends in UK government
securities? When the US securities house pulled out of the gilts market in
the late 1980s because the latter was overcrowded and unprofitable, it had
to sit on its hands and watch a really spectacular bull run.
Now, just as it has been granted permission to become a gilt-edged
marketmaker once again, the market is suffering a serious bout of weakness.
No doubt this time round, though, Merrill has had to reassure the Old Lady
of its stamina.

The Japanese don't normally scribble on other people's walls, especially in
Tokyo. So when the local headquarters of the US electronic giant Motorola is
sprayed with an anti-US slogan, people stop and stare.
Not that yesterday's anti-Motorola graffito, sparked by a US threat to
impose sanctions on Japan unless Motorola is treated better, is in
particularly bad taste. In typical Japanese style, it amounts to no more
than a polite cough by US or even European standards. 'Crush the
hard-selling diplomacy of US imperialists . . . ', it reads. Tokyo has not
yet resorted to the tactics of America's Japan-bashers in earlier trade
disputes. Sledgehammers have not been taken to Motorola's mobile phones.
Still, tempers are clearly beginning to hot up in the nine-year-old trade
dispute, despite Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's contention that Japan
and the US have just embarked on a truly adult relationship.

The stakes in the tortuous game of bluff and double bluff that the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB) has been obliged to play with the
more recalcitrant members of the life assurance industry were raised a
further notch yesterday. In responding to a formal application from the
Personal Investment Authority (PIA) to become the new unitary
self-regulatory organisation for the retail investment business, SIB
simultaneously announced that it was 'minded to recognise' the PIA and
'minded to revoke' recognition of two existing retail investment watchdogs,
Fimbra and Lautro.
Behind the legal jargon lies a difficult set of calculations both for the
regulators and the life assurers. The PIA has to achieve widespread support
before Mr Andrew Large, head of SIB, can obtain the Treasury's permission to
recognise the new unitary watchdog and bring down the curtain on its two
predecessors. Yesterday's publication of a prospectus inviting applications
to join the PIA constituted a formal start to this process.
The task is a formidable one, and not just because a handful of big insurers
are hostile. If the PIA's claim to raise standards in retail financial
services is to carry conviction the new body will have to reject
applications from people who are currently authorised to conduct investment
business. That is not a recipe for popularity in the industry. Nor should it
be.
Meantime the recalcitrants, who rank the Prudential and Standard Life among
their number, have to ask what they can achieve by continuing to oppose the
changes to the existing regime. They would also be well advised to ensure
that a dignified means of retreat is available if their arguments fail to
carry the day. Or, indeed, if they succeed. Treasury ministers may not
relish being railroaded into unwelcome policy options, any more than big
insurance companies enjoy changing their ways to suit the regulators.
Repeated scandals
Part of the problem is that many opponents of the proposed new structure
start from the assumption that they were promised self-regulation under the
original 1986 Financial Services Act regime and are still entitled to it.
This is hopelessly unrealistic in the light of repeated scandals to do with
the industry's sales practices. Public confidence has been severely dented
and will not be restored without some clear indication that the system is
being significantly strengthened. Against that background the special
pleading from leading practitioners about a surfeit of public interest
representatives on the PIA's board is a public relations disaster which
undermines the credibility of the whole industry.
Genuine alternative
Nor does it help to suggest that statutory regulation provides a genuine
alternative to the problem. In the long run it may or may not do: but there
is a crisis in the here and now, and one which urgently needs to be
addressed. To suggest that consumers of financial services should be allowed
to wait for several years while a statutory alternative is put in place
looks, at best, disingenuous. At worst it risks being interpreted as an
attempt by the life assurers to make hay for as long as possible before the
whistle is blown.
A unitary retail watchdog makes sense in a financial world where the
organisational boundaries between banks, insurers and other managers of
personal savings have become anachronistic. There are undoubtedly
shortcomings in the present process of accountability to parliament. It
remains to be seen how effective a watchdog the PIA might become. And there
will no doubt be arguments about specific elements of the PIA's prospectus
and its accompanying document on the new body's approach to regulation.
But only an industry suffering from extreme myopia would fail to recognise
that SIB's current approach is the only half-decent damage limitation
exercise on offer. The hostile insurers do no service to their shareholders,
policyholders or the general public by failing to offer their support. They
should wake up and shut up. The PIA is better than an interminable wait for
an ideal system that may or may not materialise in the year 2000.

Sir, Re your story on the Skye toll bridge ('Tolls will be steep on the high
road to Skye', February 10) it must be stressed that the agreement with the
developer is '. . . that the actual duration of the toll period would be the
period which results in the collection of tolls with a net present value of
Pounds 23.6m discounted back to December 1990 at a real interest rate of 6
per cent or 27 years, whichever period is the lesser'.
A 15-year period is based on the most optimistic traffic growth forecast and
has credibility only as propaganda with apologists for the high-toll regime.

FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greece being too quickly criticised
over Macedonia (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN CHUDLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Greek disgrace', should be entitled 'European disgrace'.
It is two short months since Greece's so-called partners in Europe rushed
with indecent haste to recognise 'Macedonia' in a crude attempt to pre-empt
the issue before Greece's presidency of the EU, in the full knowledge that
it had been a leading factor in the electoral downfall of the moderate
former prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis.
Led by Germany, with a long history of disastrous meddling in the Balkans,
and abetted by Britain and France, which ought to know better, they left the
Greek government with no option other than a dramatic gesture if it was to
retain credibility.
To complain now that this may rock the position of the 'moderate' Gligorov
and to introduce Bulgaria into the argument is pure sophistry.
Your leader writer, in company with most of Europe's leaders, shows no
sensitivity to the painful 150-year struggle of Greece to put back together
the ideal of Hellenism after nearly 2,000 years of subjugation to Roman,
Venetian, Frankish and Turkish invaders, or to the importance to them of
Philip of Macedonia, his son Alexander the Great, and Vergina, his
birthplace.
May I ask how the Scots would feel about the Faroe Islands (with about the
same justification) taking the name of the Republic of Scotland, using the
stone of Scone on its flag and having a clause in its constitution requiring
its government to involve itself in the protection of Scots wherever they
may be.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Peace talks with Mexican rebels to start today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peace talks between the Mexican government and the Zapatista rebels are
scheduled to begin today, in an effort to persuade the rebels to end
formally a conflict which began on January 1 with the seizure of half a
dozen towns in the southern state of Chiapas, reports Damian Fraser in San
Cristobal de las Casas.
However, there were few indications yesterday of an early agreement as
significant differences remained between the two sides. The peace talks are
to take place in the cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas.
Yesterday, Zapatista delegates, including Sub-commandant Marcos, the rebels'
military strategist, arrived in San Cristobal. They will spend the night
there before starting negotiations with Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the
government's peace envoy.
A truce has held for more than five weeks but the continuing presence of
armed Zapatistas has destabilised Chiapas, displaced an estimated 20,000
people from their homes, and inspired opposition to the government
throughout the country.
Sub-commandant Marcos said that the Zapatistas would only lay down their
arms after the government had enacted national democratic reforms and agreed
to broad political autonomy for regions of Mexico populated by indigenous
people.
He suggested that, while such changes were not made, the Zapatistas would
not sign a peace accord.
Mr Camacho said that he could not negotiate with armed rebels on such issues
and that to do so would not guarantee peace in Chiapas. 'A solution that is
only aimed at the Zapatista army would destabilise Chiapas. There has to be
a solution that satisfies the Zapatista army but also meets the concerns
that are fundamental for other sectors,' he said.
The government seems to intend to offer rebels some land, greater economic
aid for the region, and perhaps changes among some local political leaders.
Mr Camacho believes that any further concessions might undercut support
within the government for the peace process and lead to a conservative
backlash.
'These negotiations will be very difficult. These are people who took the
decision to begin an armed struggle and for whom political negotiation is a
total change of strategy,' Mr Camacho said.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Support for Balladur slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Support for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has fallen below
50 per cent for the first time since he took office last March, according to
a poll published yesterday, John Ridding reports from Paris.
The IFOP poll, in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the percentage of
voters satisfied with Mr Balladur had fallen by nine points to 47 per cent
over the past month. The proportion of dissatisfied voters increased by 10
points to 43 per cent.
This followed other polls of the past few weeks which have shown a decline
from an unusually high approval of more than 60 per cent. They appear to
reflect concerns about the government's failure to curb the rise in
unemployment, as well as specific issues such as the fishermen's strike this
month.
Political analysts pointed out that support for Mr Balladur remains high,
compared with previous French prime ministers and his international
counterparts.
The decline in his popularity, however, has given heart to political
opponents. Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party leader, who trails Mr Balladur
in the polls, said the political left would be in a position to challenge
the prime minister in presidential elections, due in May next year.
In an interview with Le Figaro, Mr Rocard said the prime minister had failed
to provide a vision for where France would stand in 10 years. Mr Balladur
has also faced criticism within the his own centre-right RPR-UDF coalition
government because he is seen as not doing enough to revive the economy.
A package of fiscal measures to boost the economy were announced at the end
of last month and criticised as timid by some members of the RPR. Public
discontent over Mr Balladur's failure to check unemployment of 12 per cent
has also been rising after initial satisfaction with his crackdown on crime
and firmness in world trade talks. Riots by fishermen this month have been
cited as a sign of simmering anxiety.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Kohl tries to rouse the party faithful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today faces one of the greatest challenges of his
long career in German politics: to persuade his own Christian Democratic
Union to shake off a mood of deep pessimism and believe that it can win the
general election in October.
The odds are against him. Some 1,000 delegates will assemble in Hamburg for
the three-day party conference to launch an eight-month marathon election
campaign. The CDU is trailing behind the rival Social Democratic party (SPD)
in the opinion polls, and Mr Kohl's own popularity stands even lower.
The latest poll by the Allensbach institute put the CDU and the Christian
Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian sister party, on a combined 35.1 per cent
in both halves of the country, against 40.9 per cent for the SPD. As for the
chancellor's personal rating, it stood at 26 per cent last week, against 35
per cent for Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful challenger leading the SPD.
A large majority of electors now expects a change of government in October,
and even in the ruling parties there is no majority in favour of maintaining
the current coalition between CDU, CSU and the liberal Free Democratic party
(FDP).
Reports from local party organisers around the country suggest gloom about
Mr Kohl's prospects, not only for re-election as chancellor in eight months,
but also for the CDU to stage a comeback in a string of local and state
polls over the intervening months.
Yet Mr Kohl is clearly intending to rely on his own irrepressible
self-confidence, and an attitude of extraordinary calm and composure, to
shrug off all fears of defeat in the coming months.
In two interviews last week, he showed a refusal to pay attention to the
polls, or to national pessimism about the economic recession and rising
unemployment.
'We must not let ourselves be blown off course by every contrary breeze,' he
told the daily newspaper Die Welt. 'I see no reason for pessimism or
fatalism. . . Everybody is preaching about this lousy mood in the country,
but I refuse to let myself be infected by it.'
The Allensbach opinion poll also showed one other key trend in Mr Kohl's
favour: voters are starting to drift back to the main parties - both SPD and
CDU - from the protest parties. The extreme right-wing Republicans showed a
drop in support of almost half, from 4.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, and the
Greens showed a fall from 10.2 per cent to 9 per cent. The SPD was up four
percentage points on the previous poll in December, and the CDU by two
points.
In spite of a large grumbling minority within the CDU about Mr Kohl's lack
of direction in his leadership, and his own unpopularity, no one expects any
serious attempt at a coup against him at the party conference.
The official aim is to endorse a new basic political programme for the
party, its first new draft since 1978, and in particular, the first for a
unified Germany.
There could still be mildly stormy debates about Europe - should the word
'federal' be applied to European integration or not - about the environment,
and about family policy.
Some want the party to be committed to a new goal of an ecological economy
as well as the traditional 'social market'.
There is a controversial move to introduce a new tax on the childless, to
help finance the soaring cost of old-age pensions.
The whole affair, however, is about how to win the next elections. The new
party programme is called 'Freedom and Responsibility'. Yet the real party
programme is called quite simply 'Helmut Kohl'.
As the Cologne Stadt Anzeiger newspaper said last week: 'With Kohl, many
admit it will be difficult to win. Without him, they know the election is as
good as lost already.'
A new protest party has attacked Mr Kohl for his pro-Europe stance on the
eve of the CDU congress. The Alliance of Free Citizens said the CDU was
anti-constitutional in striving for a European Federation. Mr Manfred
Brunner said Mr Kohl had signed a death sentence on the D-Mark.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arkady Volsky, chief of a Russian industrialists' and entrepreneurs'
union, called at the weekend for western capital to support what he called
the new government's attempts to restore 'basic organisation' to the economy
in order to continue reforms.
Mr Volsky, a close associate of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
who has called for 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation and more state
intervention in the economy, denied Russia lacked the right political and
economic conditions to receive large-scale financial assistance.
He also called for 'international compensation' to Russia for 'billions of
dollars' it had lost because of its adherence to sanctions against the
former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya.
Mr Chernomyrdin has continued to issue conflicting signals about the
intentions of his new economic team of former industrial managers. 'They are
scared of being blamed for fuelling inflation. They do not know what to do.
They have made promises but no decisions,' said one reformer still in the
government.
On Friday, Mr Chernomyrdin signed a document bringing closer a controversial
monetary union with neighbouring Belarus. Although the terms of the proposed
union have yet to be made public, this project will inevitably mean
increased pressure on Russia's finances.
In an attempt to lessen the burden of neighbouring republics, Russia last
year cut energy supplies to the Commonwealth of Independent States by 40 per
cent for oil and 25 per cent for gas, according to official figures
published yesterday.
Mr Chernomyrdin also reassured Ukraine that Russia had no desire to take
back the Crimean peninsula after Crimea's new president, who has promised a
referendum on reunification with Russia, asked a former Russian deputy
premier to head his government.
Pending a speech next Thursday, when President Boris Yeltsin is expected to
clarify whether he endorses Mr Chernomyrdin's economic policy shift, the
Russian prime minister has also issued instructions to make it more
difficult for ailing companies to be declared bankrupt.
As well as trying to attract western investment to ailing enterprises, Mr
Chernomyrdin is desperately trying to persuade the International Monetary
Fund to unlock a new Dollars 1.5bn loan to help him support new budget
expenditure. Mr Volsky's open letter is clearly designed to aid those
efforts.
In a sign of some continuing western efforts to support Russian reforms,
Russia's privatisation ministry, headed by the only senior radical left in
the government, unveiled a service providing free capitalist expertise to
help managers of privatised enterprises.
Advisers provided by leading western companies will assist with business
plans, rationalisation and cost cutting programmes, as well as staff
training, and searching for foreign investors.

Defence Minister Lajos Fuer will lead Hungary's main governing party, the
Hungarian Democratic Forum, into elections in May, AP reports from Budapest.
Mr Fuer was elected the new president of the forum in a vote late on
Saturday at the party's congress. The forum is the leading party in the
conservative coalition government, whose popularity is slipping because of
economic troubles.
Mr Fuer, 55, a historian, was the sole candidate. He won 685 of 729 ballots
cast.
He was arrested by Russian troops after the suppression of the 1956 revolt
and briefly interned. He was a founding member of the forum and has been a
member of its national presidium since 1988.
'I will continue the policies of the late prime minister Jozsef Antall,' he
told the delegates. Antall, who died in December of cancer, held both the
party chairmanship and premiership.
His successor as premier, Mr Peter Boross, said he did not want both posts.
Mr Fuer told the three-day congress that his party has a chance of 20 to 30
per cent of the votes in the parliamentary elections.
Recent opinion polls have indicated that the forum would gain only 8 per
cent of the vote. The Socialist party is leading the polls, with 18 per
cent.

MG's supervisory board chairman, is likely to explain the background to the
near-collapse of the company. Chief to explain strategy, Page 19

MONDAY 21
German strike ballot
The national executive of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, meets
to decide in which region it will hold a strike ballot, with the intention
of calling a strike in early March. Baden-Wurttemberg and North
Rhine-Westphalia are the most likely contenders. Yet there are still hopes
for a negotiated solution to the dispute concerning pay and conditions, with
engineering employers seeking drastic cost cuts.
North Korea
Today is the deadline for North Korea to permit inspection of its nuclear
facilities. An eleventh-hour agreement with the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) means that there will be no immediate clash with the UN
Security Council. North Korea's last-minute compliance ensures that it will
not be accused of violating the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty at an IAEA board of governors' meeting today.
European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the Balkan
crisis and the enlargement of the union. Member states are expected to use
the meeting to lodge further protests at Greece's recent decision to
blockade Macedonia. Meanwhile the foreign ministers will also be seeking to
hammer out more details in the enlargement negotiations, in advance of the
special EU council meeting on enlargement next weekend. EU agricultural
ministers also meet today.
Euro Disney's 60 banks receive the final version of an investigative audit
of the troubled leisure group's finances from KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm. A meeting with Euro Disney will then be arranged to start
negotiations about its emergency financial restructuring. The banks last
week discussed preliminary proposals for restructuring with executives of
Euro Disney and Walt Disney.
EU networks about to extend: The European Union's ambitious trans-European
networks initiative, which aims to develop telecommunications, energy and
transport networks spanning the region, takes its next step forward today .
Mr Henning Christophersen (above), economics commissioner, chairs the second
meeting of a taskforce consisting of senior officials from member states.
The group will consider which transport and energy projects should be given
priority and various options for finance.
Holidays: US, President's Day holiday. Federal government offices closed.
TUESDAY 22
Greenspan on policy
Mr Alan Greenspan,the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, gives his
bi-annual address to Congress on the state of the economy and current
central bank monetary policy. He is likely to be grilled about his decision
to raise interest rates on February 4. It was the first tightening of US
monetary policy in five years, and some in Congress criticised the decision
as likely to hinder, not help, the economy.
Gatt and the environment: In Geneva, the governing council of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade debates the link between trade and the
environment. The ministerial meeting in Marrakesh on April 12-15, to set the
course of Gatt's future work on the issue, is uppermost in trade diplomats'
minds. Greens say trade rules need changing to secure environmental goals;
developing countries fear greenery cloaks protectionism.
UK revised GDP figures will be watched closely by the markets, in the wake
of last week's disappointing economic statistics. Traders are likely to see
any downwards revision from the earlier estimate of a 0.7 per cent rise in
1993's fourth quarter as a sign that the recovery is faltering.
Women priests in prospect: The general synod of the Church of England meets
in London for a final debate on the legislation to permit the ordination of
women priests. If, as is almost certain, the synod approves the legislation
the first women to become priests will be ordained before Easter.
Giovanni Goria goes on trial: Former Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria
(left), a Christian Democrat, goes on trial for alleged corruption in Turin.
Mr Goria resigned as finance minister because of his alleged involvement in
irregularities in a savings bank scandal. More than 50 deputies and senators
and 1,000 senior politicians and businessmen were investigated.
Mr Geidar Aliev, only member of the Brezhnev-era Politburo to have survived
as a leader in the post Communist era, arrives in Britain with a large
demand and a large promise. The demand is that Armenia be recognised as an
aggressor against Azerbaijan after the forces from the Armenian-populated
enclave of Nagorno Karabakh within Azerbaijan captured swathes of Azeri
territory. The promise is of exploitation rights, for BP among other large
oil companies, of reserves in the Caspian sea off Baku which has the oil
industry entranced and the more enthusiastic of the Azeris talking of a new
Kuwait.
WEDNESDAY 23
Kohl to galvanise CDU
Mr Helmut Kohl, the man who brought Germany unification, continues his
Christian Democratic Union's election campaign at the party conference in
Hamburg. He must galvanise his party and revive its spirits in the face of
economic recession and a slump in electoral support across the country. The
question is whether Mr Kohl, with his very considerable political experience
and cunning, can reverse the downward trend in the polls. His hopes rest on
three things: a recovery of the German economy; the desire of electors to
return to the familiarity and security of the ruling coalition at national,
rather than local, elections; and his own ruthless political instincts in a
frantic election year. There are 19 separate elections ahead, leading up to
the general election on October 16. The conference ends today.
Zhu Rongji starts tour of Japan: The Chinese vice premier (left) begins a
nine-day official visit to Japan, to meet Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister,
and other leaders. He is the first senior Chinese leader to visit Japan
since prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa took power last August.
Han Sung-joo, South Korean Foreign Minister, visits Mexico in the course of
what was originally planned as a trade trip in connection with the creation
of the North American Free Trade area. .
Race relations relaunched: Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public
service, and Mr Herman Ouseley, chairman of the Commission for Racial
Equality, will launch a new look for Britain's race relations organisation.
The CRE will adopt Citizen's Charter service standards and a new structure
in an attempt to provide improved services to members of ethnic minority
communities.
Fresh Guildford Four appeal: Paul Hill, 38, from Belfast, starts his appeal
against conviction for killing a soldier in Belfast in 1974. Mr Hill has
been on bail since the Guildford Four were released in October 1989. His
appeal against conviction for murdering a former soldier, Mr Brian Shaw, in
1974 will be heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Brian Hutton, Lord Justice
MacDermott and Mr Justice McCollum.
THURSDAY 24
Anxiety at Yeltsin address
Boris Yeltsin is to address both houses of parliament, an event postponed
from February 18 because the Russian president was suffering from a cold.
His speech will now be heard with special attention as concern mounts
throughout the international community regarding the president's stamina.
His words will be especially scrutinised for indications of exactly how he
intends to maintain the progress of economic reform.
More US economic data are published today, providing further evidence of
whether or not the economic expansion is continuing this year. Figures
include durable goods orders and durable shipments in January, and initial
unemployment claims, state benefits, and weekly money supply statistics.
Romanian unrest intensifies: The farmers' union Agro-Star plans a one-day
strike in protest at government agricultural policies and the poor
administration of state farms. Romanian airport workers plan a one-hour
strike in support of wage claims tomorrow. Romania's three main labour blocs
strike on February 28 to back demands for a change of government. Last week
President Ion Iliescu met leaders of the Alfa trade union movement, one of
Romania's three main labour blocs.
Discontent has grown steadily among the 23m Romanians, fuelled by inflation,
since the one-party communist state collapsed in December 1989.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin ends his four-day official trip to Spain and
Portugal, hoping to persuade them to influence more Arab states to make
peace with Israel.
Tokyo court bribery hearing: Tokyo District Court holds its first hearing on
the alleged bribery case involving former Miyagi governor Shuntaro Honma and
executives at Daishowa Paper. Daishowa Paper is the country's second largest
paper manufacturer. The defendants include Mr Ryoei Saito, (above) honorary
chairman of Daishowa Paper, notorious for his desire to be buried alongside
his collection of Impressionist paintings. The arrest of Mr Saito, 77,
followed allegations that he authorised a Y100m (Pounds 630,000) payment to
a governor who approved a Daishowa-linked golf course and housing complex.
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata visits Mbabane in Swaziland
to assess the situation with regard to refugees from Mozambique (until Feb
27).
FRIDAY 25
Greens seize protest role
In Mannheim, the German Greens begin their two-day party conference. The
Greens will be seeking to launch themselves as the main party of protest
against the political establishment in this marathon election year.
Moroccan unions take action: A Moroccan federation of unions plans a 24-hour
strike today to protest at the government's continued refusal to participate
in talks. A similar strike in December 1990 caused riots in several cities
in which at least 43 people were killed.
Keen hope for EU enlargement: Foreign ministers assemble in Brussels for a
special EU council meeting on the enlargement of the union. The participants
will aim to consolidate the progress made in preliminary talks earlier in
the week.
Japanese construction scandal: Tokyo District Court holds its first hearing
on the alleged bribery case involving Mr Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of
Ibaraki north of Tokyo. Four construction groups are involved in charges of
bribery relating to tenders for a government dam project.
WEEKEND 26-27
Group of Seven on CIS
Finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven (G7)
gather in Kronberg, in the Taunus hills north of Frankfurt, to debate the
plight of the Russian economy. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister,
whose country is most exposed to Russia's debt problems, invited them.
Italy's election in March will be the first under a new simple majority
system but the voters are likely to be as confused as ever. Fully 320
polling booth symbols have been submitted for approval before Sunday's
deadline for filing candidates' names.
Twin Towers bombing: The anniversary of the World Trade Center bombing in
New York may be marked by the end of the four-and-a-half month trial of the
alleged bombers. Prosecution and defence should have concluded summations by
Monday, and the jury may pass judgement on the four defendants - Mohammad
Salameh, Ahmad Ajaj, Nidal Ayyad and Mahmud Abouhalima - shortly afterwards.

Monday: The board of I G Metall, the German engineering workers' union,
meets to decide on possible strike ballot. A ballot will take several days
to organise and at least two days to conduct.
Tuesday: The French trade balance for December is expected to show a
Ffr6.7bn surplus, compared with Ffr6.6bn in November.
Thursday: German cost of living figures, expected today, are forecast to
show a further fall from January's 3.5 per cent to an annual rate of 3.2-3.4
per cent in February. Underlying inflation pressures have eased, allowing
the Bundesbank to cut rates last week.
Friday: The CBI monthly trends report for February will provide further
evidence of the strength of the UK economy. The quarterly report, published
last month, presented a fairly upbeat picture of business confidence.
The UK will also publish its trade balance with non-European Union countries
in January. The deficit is expected to have widened to Pounds 790m, from
Pounds 675m in December. French consumer price index figures for January are
expected to show that inflation still remains low at 2.1 per cent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Investors scan the horizon for clouds - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street is taking a well-deserved rest today to mark Presidents' Day,
but many investors will no doubt take a moment out during the holiday to
reflect on the stormy events of last week.
When investors and brokers return to their trading screens tomorrow, few
will have any doubts that the market is now in a period of transition. Amid
the uncertainty which that has engendered, analysts see a further weakening
of share prices over the next week or two.
Mr Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read in New York, sees a
general downward bias over the next month or two, although stocks could well
trade a little higher this week. 'But any gains should be viewed in the
context of a correction,' he cautions.
The turning point for the financial markets came a fortnight ago, when the
Federal Reserve decided to tighten monetary policy for the first time in
five years. But the true implications of the move were only driven home last
Thursday and Friday, when the underlying optimism which had driven the
financial markets forward seemed to have finally broken.
During both sessions, investors appeared to be in mourning the bygone days
when interest rates would only go down. In the bond market, holders of the
inflation-sensitive 30-year issue were unconsoled by data showing no
increase in consumer prices last month. Instead, they drove yields over 6.60
per cent for the first time since July, on the strength of a second-tier
report showing some Philadelphia manufacturers had paid higher prices for
materials.
By force of habit, stocks followed Treasury prices lower, just as they have
followed them up over the life of the three-year bull market.
'The Fed has bruised the market, there is no doubt about that,' says Mr Don
Hays, market strategist at Wheat First Butcher  Singer in Norfolk,
Virginia. 'It is now in a healing period, and (last week) was a classic
illustration of that.' Instead of searching for silver linings, he argues,
investors are scanning the horizon for clouds.
One of the clouds in investors' sights last week will arrive today. Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is scheduled to present his twice-yearly
Humphrey Hawkins testimony on monetary policy to a congressional committee.
Analysts fear that no matter what Mr Greenspan says, the market will find
good cause to trade down.
Will stocks necessarily follow? Only so far, say analysts. Looking back at
the Philadelphia manufacturing data, Mr McAlinden finds reason for guarded
optimism. He points out that higher prices may indeed bring even higher
interest rates, but the trend also suggests improved corporate earnings in
some sectors. In that regard, he sees no fundamental change in a dynamic
that has powered the market since the autumn.
'The two forces are involved in a tug of war,' he says. For a few weeks,
anyway, the interest-rate bears are likely to be dominant.

TOKYO
While upward pressure on the yen seems to have subsided, stock market
traders will continue to focus on the currency market and developments over
US-Japan trade negotiations. The Nikkei index is likely to fluctuate on low
volume, but may face selling by corporations realising profits ahead of the
March book closing to supplement weak operating profits.
FRANKFURT
After last week's discount rate cut, the pending M3 money supply growth
figures for January may come as an anticlimax, but there is the possibility
that the Bundesbank will turn its attention to the 6 per cent repo rate when
a DM72.2bn repurchase agreement expires on Wednesday. On Monday, IG Metall
engineering workers' union officials may have to decide whether to call a
strike ballot after the failure of pay talks.
AMSTERDAM
The big internationals feature, with Unilever's preliminary figures due on
Tuesday and the Royal Dutch/Shell group's full-year 1993 figures on
Thursday. Hoare Govett looks for a 4.5 per cent rise in net profits from the
consumer products giant, saying sterling's continued weakness through 1993
acts as a constraint on the guilder dividend; it projects a slight decrease
in earnings per share, but a marginally higher dividend from Royal Dutch.
OSLO
Weak oil prices and aluminium industry politics have not stopped Norsk
Hydro's upward share price career. Monday's 1993 results should produce
earnings up from NKr8.60 to NKr15.60 a share, says NatWest Securities.
COPENHAGEN
Bracketed by other major bank results - AIB in Dublin, Svenska Handelbanken
in Stockholm and UBS in Zurich - Den Danske is due with its 1993 figures on
Thursday. Markedly higher profits are expected: The Estimate Directory
offers a consensus EPS forecast of DKr47.0, up from DKr30 in 1992.
ZURICH
Alusuisse 1993 results are expected on Friday. The group has indicated a
sharp cut in 1993 net profits, due to weak economic conditions and poor
aluminium prices, as well as the additional costs of closing capacity in
aluminium production.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Big sell-off in bonds casts a shadow -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market kicks off the second leg of the two-week trading account
this morning under considerable threat from the big sell-off across
international bond markets late last Friday.
Share prices look almost certain to be marked down sharply at the outset of
dealings, in what could be a re-run of the pattern of trading over the past
two Mondays. The volatility was prompted by the US Federal Reserve's
decision to tighten monetary policy. Two weeks ago, a fall in the the Dow
Jones Average was matched almost point-for-point when London opened the
following Monday, before recouping around half its opening fall.
The immediate focus of attention will be the gilts market and European bonds
to see if there is any substantial follow-through selling. The closure of
Wall Street for a US holiday could provide an element of stability in
London. Another crucial pointer for international markets, with the obvious
implications for London, comes tomorrow when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, addresses the US Congress.
The 3,350 level on the FT-SE is viewed by market-makers and some chartists
as a strong rallying point and any decisive move below that level could be
the trigger for more big selling of leading stocks.
In spite of the wild swings in the equity market there is still no shortage
of optimists. In a reference to the recent spate of UK economic data NatWest
Securities says: 'The prospect of a further cut in UK base-rates is back on
the agenda.' NatWest remains happy with its year-end FT-SE 100 forecast of
3,900.
Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, is even more bullish, forecasting
a year-end FT-SE 100 number of 3,950. Salomon makes the point that since
1980 the UK stock market has rallied in every year after the first Fed
tightening, by between 14 per cent and 38 per cent.
The broker says that in spite of rising US rates (it expects the Fed to
tighten to 3 3/4 - 4 per cent by mid-year), it expects further rate cuts in
Europe, underpinning equities.
However, the equity market does face another searching examination of the
currently popular theory of strong earnings recovery, as no less than 10 of
the FT-SE 100 constituents unveil preliminary figures this week.
If the reporting season to date is anything to go by, the market could be
pleasantly surprised, although some broking houses, such as Nikko
Securities, believe the risk is on the downside. Nikko says: 'Further
downgradings of earnings estimates are likely as adjustments are made for
growth prospects in a low inflation environment'.
Three of the UK's big composite insurance groups, Guardian Royal Exchange,
Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, and the UK's biggest insurance broker,
Sedgwick, report during the week. While analysts will obviously focus on the
expected strong recovery in profitability, the good numbers may also revive
takeover speculation in the sector, which has underperformed the wider
market in recent months.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Money managers take a fresh look at
commodities - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US, the apparent swing into the second stage of a business cycle
recovery has drawn big money's attention back to commodities. After years of
underperforming fixed-income investments, commodities - particularly metals
like copper and aluminium - outperformed bonds in the first month of this
year.
Although low oil prices have kept inflation concerns at bay, money managers
still reason that owning physical assets will pay off with big returns when
a surge in demand breathes life back into basic industries that are
commodity consumers.
Mutual fund managers and other money managers have piled into commodity
proxies - mostly shares of companies that are commodities processors -
pumping up prices to unrealistic levels.
Newmont Gold, a US mining company, is priced at almost 50 times current
earnings, while the US's largest aluminium companies, which posted large
losses in 1993, are trading at 100 times projected earnings two or three
years into the future.
What has happened, analysts say, is that the total market capitalisation of
commodity-linked equities is too small for the purposes of mutual funds,
which have an estimated Dollars 2,000bn in assets to invest. US pension
funds, also interested in commodities, weigh in with another Dollars 2,000bn
in assets.
Direct investment in commodities would seem a logical alternative, but most
mutual funds and many pension funds and insurance companies are prevented by
charter or their investment boards from owning physical commodities or
commodity futures.
Derivatives dealers have moved in to ease the strain, offering structured
notes with values tied to the price movement of an underlying commodity, but
which fit the definition of a fixed-income investment.
Swaps based on commodity price relationships are also being sold to fund
managers. These deals could gradually inflate prices in the physical
markets, traders say, again because the money to be invested is vast
compared to overall market size.
Wall Street's pin-striped fund managers have been tiptoeing into
fixed-income instruments linked to corn prices, because the unusually low
feedgrain supplies in the US this year have boosted prices; into structured
oil deals, because oil prices are at historically low levels; and into base
metals, where prices occasionally sank below production costs last year when
Russian supplies glutted markets.
Last month, a California-based insurance fund with Dollars 14bn in
fixed-income assets ventured into the oil swaps market for the first time in
a trade based on expectations that the upwardly-sloping forward oil price
curve will invert to a more traditional backwardation (whereby the spot
price is above the deferred delivery date) during the next 18 months, with
spot prices moving above the two-year forward price.
Merrill Lynch persuaded Pacific Mutual Life Insurance to invest about
Dollars 15m in the 1m barrel trade as a means of diversifying assets.
Pacific Mutual will profit if the spread returns to a pre-defined level. If
the spread does not move out of contango (whereby the spot price is below
the deferred delivery price), Merrill Lynch will profit from the trade.
The trade was an unusual one for an insurance fund, but could herald a
trend. Banks and broker-dealers are actively adding commodity-derivatives
expertise to their trading and sales rosters, viewing commodities as a
lucrative expansion opportunity as growth in foreign exchange and interest
rate derivatives businesses level out.

The gilts market faces a difficult few days, after the sell-off in world
bond markets last week. US investors were reported to be heavy sellers of
European bonds.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, described the
market as 'truly unbelievable' in the wake of a series of economic
statistics which should have been favourable for gilts.
'A week ago, if someone had said we will give you 10 statistics which point
to a weak economy and low price pressures, and a German rate cut, I would
have said gilts would be up three points. In fact they were down two. The
market has lost track with fundamentals,' Mr Briscoe believes.
With US Treasuries performing badly on a Philadelphia Fed report of an
upturn in inflationary pressures, Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research
at Yamaichi International (Europe), said: 'UK investors are looking to the
US as a guide to the outlook in the UK'.
All this is a bad omen for the next auction, of Pounds 2.5bn of 7 per cent
gilt stock, due on Wednesday. Mr Richardson said there is a chance that
gilts fell sufficiently last week to make the new stock attractive, with the
spread over German bunds now 87 basis points. But Mr Briscoe warned it could
be a make or break auction.

Although the US bond market is closed today for the Presidents' Day holiday,
the calendar is busy enough in the rest of the week to provide fixed-income
investors with something new to digest.
Tomorrow, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gives the
biannual Humphrey Hawkins address to Congress, where he is expected to
provide more details of the thinking behind the February 4 increase in US
interest rates, which has so disturbed bond market sentiment over the past
fortnight. Any hint from Mr Greenspan that he is close to tightening policy
again would be likely to upset the already rattled market.
Also tomorrow, the Conference Board releases its latest survey of consumer
confidence, and analysts are expecting little change in the reading. On
Thursday, the January durable goods orders report is released, and continued
strength in the numbers is expected. A day later the latest monthly existing
home sales figures are published.
Finally, this week's Treasury auctions could cause a few problems, given the
current weakness in market sentiment. On Wednesday, Dollars 17bn of two-year
notes will be sold, followed by Dollars 11bn of five-year notes on Thursday.
If prices continue to fall, the auctions could prove a crucial test of the
market's mood.

While the sluggishness of the Japanese economy remains unchanged, Japanese
government bond prices may lose ground on supply and demand factors.
Profit-taking ahead of the March book-closing by life assurers and banks is
expected to accelerate, depressing long bond prices.
The Japan Securities Dealers' Association, says trust banks became net
sellers of government and corporate bonds in January for the first time in a
year, selling a net Y368.5bn. City, or commercial, banks were net sellers
for the fourth consecutive month, while long-term credit banks were net
sellers for the third straight month.
An increase in supply of medium-term corporate bonds is also adding to the
lack of appetite for government bonds among institutional investors, while
hedge selling on the futures market by underwriters has been weighing on the
market. Traders are also cautious ahead of an increase in issuance of
municipal bonds over the coming months.
However, the Bank of Japan is increasingly wary of a further rise in medium
and long-term interest rates while the slump in business confidence
continues. Some traders hope that the central bank will allow short-term
money rates, which are already at record lows, to ease further, thus
supporting bond prices.

FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Europe unwilling to decouple from US -
Capital  Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's government bond markets are in the most extraordinary state of
turmoil, ruled more - it would seem - by gut feelings than by anything
resembling cool, calm economic analysis.
Last Thursday, the Bundesbank surprised the world financial markets with a
half-point cut in the German discount rate, lowering it from 5.75 per cent
to 5.25 per cent.
The European bond markets, which have a tendency to hang on to every word,
twitch of the eyebrow or other signal from the Bundesbank, have been
obsessed with the question of 'will they, won't they cut rates?' for weeks.
And no sooner had the Bundesbank cut its discount rate, than nearly every
other European central bank was free to follow suit.
Belgium, Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands announced their moves on
Thursday, while Spain, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden waited until Friday,
leaving France as the obstinate 'odd man out'.
The Bank of France could well move as early as this week given the French
franc/D-Mark exchange rate, or else could wait until Germany lowers its repo
rate.
However, while the European bond markets rejoiced at first in the
long-awaited news of a German easing, there was a pretty smart turnround by
late Thursday afternoon, followed by a sharp fall in European government
bond prices on Friday afternoon.
What on earth was going on, most people wondered as they watched gilts,
bunds, OATs and a host of other European bonds tumble in largely
futures-driven trading.
For a start, world bond markets have clearly been rattled by the revival of
concern about inflation in the US and the decision by the US Federal Reserve
to raise short-term interest rates on February 4.
Of course, bond markets hate the thought of rising inflation: the fact that
the Fed's move was intended to be a pre-emptive strike - rather than a
strong dose of medicine to cure an existing ill - was largely ignored.
The fact that the Bank of England snipped a quarter point off the base
lending rate, taking it down to 5.25 per cent, only a few days later on
February 8 should have reminded the markets that interest rates on this side
of the Atlantic are still following a downward path.
In addition, of course, the Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate
last Thursday, sparking off a round of similar easings in Europe, again
should have confirmed that the future direction for European interest rates
is down, rather than up.
However, the markets still remain jittery and almost determined to focus on
the very worst news on the inflation front.
Witness what happened in the US last Thursday: the announcement that US
consumer prices last month were unchanged on the previous month and ahead by
only 2.5 per cent in the year to January should have been good for US
Treasury bonds.
Instead, the Treasury market chose to concentrate on a report on regional
economic conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which
showed a sharp rise in the bank's index of manufactured goods prices.
The US inflation worries have clearly spooked the European markets. On top
of this, though, rumours of substantial trading losses by certain
proprietary trading desks and reports of extremely heavy selling by US hedge
funds have swept the European bond markets.
'The market psychology right now is very very negative,' said one European
bond dealer.
Some dealers point out that the very volatile market conditions have made
trading difficult.
'It's been so choppy, some days you lose a lot but then other days you can
make it all back up again,' said one dealer at a US bond house.
But while traders are, not surprisingly, loath to discuss how much money
they have lost, they confirm that much of the selling pressure has come out
of the US, particularly from US hedge funds.
These are private pools of funds which are managed very aggressively: they
are highly leveraged and were one of the driving forces behind the surge in
European government bond prices last year.
'It's been a frightening experience to see such a massive liquidation of
bonds,' said one analyst last week.
'There's been a tide of selling, and people have got stuck with positions
they don't want to be in, and have had to offload. Nor is it possible to say
with any conviction that the selling has come to an end.'
The problem, points out Mr George Magnus, international economist at S. G.
Warburg Securities, is that a sensible valuation or economic analysis of the
European bond markets simply does not enter into the picture at all.
'Even if you point out that European yields will fall back to the levels
where they were at the end of 1993, the words just fall on deaf ears,' he
says.
For the moment, at least, the European bond markets appear unwilling to
decouple from the moves in the US.

FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Moves to develop 'structured' bonds -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Lay, the director of financial operations at the World Bank, just
cannot sit still. Now that his efforts to develop a truly international
capital market through his global bond concept have paid off, he is using
his formidable energy and influence to improve the secondary market
liquidity in derivative-linked or 'structured' bonds.
An increasing number of borrowers are issuing structured bonds because the
derivative element embedded in the bonds enables them to achieve a cheaper
cost of funds than if they launched a straightforward Eurobond or global
bond offering. Structured bonds are equally popular with investors who want
to back their views about the direction of anything from interest rates to
an individual company's share price.
But since these transactions are frequently driven by fleeting arbitrage
opportunities and tailored to specific investors, they tend to be relatively
small in relation to Eurobond or global bond market offerings. Syndicate
managers say the average size of structured bond offerings is about Dollars
100m.
As a result, investors often run into difficulty when they come to sell the
bonds. Main complaints are the lack of price transparency and liquidity in
the secondary market, which means holders often receive less than the
inherent value of the bonds.
World Bank officials have discussed with about 200 investors how to reduce
the deficiencies in the structured bond market. They believe the innovative
facilities of the World Bank's imminent Dollars 5bn global multi-currency
note programme should help to address these concerns. The programme offers
the following advantages:
Price transparency: the seven sponsoring dealers will regularly publish
indicative bid prices for World Bank structured bonds issued under the
programme on dedicated screens distributed by widely available services. The
World Bank expects that competitive pressures among dealers will lead them
to improve secondary market prices.
Secondary market liquidity: by offering to exchange outstanding structured
notes for new floating-rate or structured notes, the World Bank hopes to be
more supportive of sponsoring dealers' secondary market activities than
other issuers.
Issuance, trading and custody: global documentation (bonds issued under the
programme may be governed by New York, English or German law) will allow for
timely and streamlined issuance of structured bonds in a wide range of
markets, currencies and maturities. The programme also provides for a choice
of clearing systems and cross-market clearing and settlement in major
markets.
Mr Bim Hundal, head of medium-term note (MTN) programmes at Goldman Sachs,
one of the sponsoring dealers of the World Bank's programme, says the World
Bank's decision to formalise the role of dealers is an important step in the
development of the structured bond market.
The increased competition and the knowledge that the World Bank is measuring
their performance should encourage dealers to make realistic prices in the
bonds. The increased price transparency will benefit investors whenever they
value their holdings either for regulatory or trading purposes.
The World Bank hopes its measures will widen the investor appeal of
structured bonds since it plans to raise at least Dollars 2bn of its annual
borrowing programme of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn through
structured products. These products will be linked only to interest rates
and exchange rates.
Although structured bonds tend to have relatively short maturities - the
result of investor worries about the lack of liquidity - the World Bank
hopes its liquidity facility will enable it to achieve maturities of between
four and 10 years.
The global platform built into the World Bank's programme is likely to be
imitated by other issuers who want to have one MTN programme which allows
them access to all the world's major markets.
The volume of MTN programmes has grown rapidly over the past few years as
issuers seek to lower their documentation costs and cut the time involved in
launching a bond offering.
Mr Juan Costain, head of capital markets at Kidder Peabody, another
sponsoring dealer of the World Bank's programme, estimates that the volume
of MTNs grew by 2 1/2 times last year to Dollars 127bn. Of this, about
Dollars 60bn was in structured bonds and this year the volume could reach
Dollars 75bn.
According to Mr Costain, the documentation costs for a Euro-MTN programme,
under which an issuer can make numerous Eurobond offerings, are about
Dollars 100,000, the same as for an individual Eurobond offering. Although
the documentation cost of a global programme is closer to Dollars 300,000,
the issuer is likely to achieve even lower costs of funding because of the
immediate access to a far wider range of markets and currencies.

Last week's half-point cut in the discount rate took the markets by surprise
but did nothing to satisfy bund market investors.
There was disappointment that the cut to 5.25 per cent did not go hand in
hand with a reduction in the all-important securities repurchase or 'repo'
rate, which was fixed for this week at 6 per cent - where it has been for
the past two months.
It is difficult to see what can provide the impetus for a change in
sentiment. Good data on January M3 - which may be published this week - will
not change the fact that the easing move last week was less substantial than
the markets wanted.
Developments in the US government securities market will also be watched
carefully: further anxiety about rate rises in North America is likely to
spill over into the German market, where the average current yield was 5.78
per cent on Friday and the yield of many 10-year issues was back over the 6
per cent mark.
There is a danger that the Bundesbank reduced the discount rate merely to
put the proper margin between it and the repo rate. Mr Paul Brunker of
Robert Fleming in London thinks the Bundesbank wants to see how the currency
holds up in the wake of rate cuts. But, he warns, nerves will be stretched
if there is no signal of further easing in the next two weeks.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Rough riding ahead in China - The Emerging
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's fledgling stock markets are set for another bumpy year while traders
digest implications of a new tax law, a government credit squeeze limiting
funds available for investment, and faltering attempts to conclude a new
securities law.
Judging by sharp fluctuations in the first seven weeks of the year of both
the yuan-denominated A-share and dollar B-share indexes - they dived before
recovering some lost ground - traders are jittery.
Investors are likely to continue to be distracted by plans to float a new
batch of Chinese companies on overseas stock exchanges, by talk of a third
stock exchange by the end of the year, and by fears that China's credit
crunch may herald the beginning of a recession.
Other factors depressing share prices include improving bond yields and a
rash of new issues. Twelve-month treasury bonds yielding 11.9 per cent are
proving appealing to institutional and individual invest-ors.
The new tax law is another factor dragging markets down since it leaves it
unclear whether investors are liable for capital gains tax on top of charges
on share transactions and tax on dividends.
But if there is good news for Chinese investors and foreign institutions
warily testing the markets, it lies in the apparent commitment of China's
stock regulators to further economic liberalisation, and to stiffening
regulatory procedures.
Professor Li Yining, one of China's most influential economists and the head
of a parliamentary committee drafting the new Securities Law, believes that
additional steps to bolster public trust in capital markets are vital for
market reforms.
China's Securities Law is now in its seventh draft and Prof Li hopes that by
the end of this year it will be implemented, although a number of
contentious issues remain to be resolved.
These include differences over the degree of self-regulation to be allowed
to local exchanges; over whether over-the-counter trading will be permitted;
and whether state shares (as opposed to those held by institutions and
individuals) should be traded in the market.
Some officials fear this will lead to the state losing control of state
enterprises.
Prof Li favours stronger central control over markets, but says that given
powerful provincial interests it would be difficult for a body like the US
Securities and Exchange Commission to emerge in China.
He also believes that OTC trading should be permitted, since to outlaw it
would only encourage a 'black market'.
And, finally, he feels that 'state-owned shares' should be traded, otherwise
'they are dead'.
Most importantly, however, Prof Li sees the development of China's equity
markets as a means of facilitating a faltering process of corporatisation
and privatisation. 'If we don't set up shareholding companies we will never
be able to separate government and management,' he says.
Among the authorities' most urgent tasks is the effort to 'corporatise'  -
this is a Chinese half-way house to privatisation in which enterprises are
detached from state control - or fully privatise elements of the faltering
state sector. This involves dealing with the vexed property rights issue.
Until the question of ownership of state assets is resolved, and therefore
who should be responsible for disposing of such assets, the process of
unravelling state control will prove difficult, if not impossible.
Various creative solutions have been advanced, including channelling state
assets into a special 'State Investment Corporation' which would be
responsible for divestiture; the transfer of assets from the government
itself to larger enterprises; or the establishment of provincial commissions
which would also be entrusted with the task of selling off state assets.
These solutions are believed to be reflected in one form or another in a
draft law on 'Controlling State Assets' submitted recently to the State
Council, or cabinet. This measure, together with a new Corporate Law due to
come into effect in July, should go some way towards providing the legal
basis for a rational process of divestiture.
Prof Li himself favours a combination of the various approaches mentioned
above together with full privatisation for smaller enterprises, and mixed
state and private ownership for larger businesses along the lines of the
French or Scandinavian models.
Foreign legal experts believe that China is slowly moving towards having a
'pretty good' regulatory framework, although they criticise what they regard
as an arbitrary approach by the Securities Regulatory Commission - the
national securities watchdog - to selecting companies for overseas listing.
They note that of the latest batch of 23 companies selected for listing
abroad - six mainland companies listed in Hong Kong last year - there is a
preponderance of power companies, including three from Shandong province
alone. This suggests a less than rational approach in the selection process,
and also reflects, no doubt, powerful lobbying at the centre.
Premier Li Peng's family, for example, has long been connected with the
power company, Huaneng International, which is among the candidates for
foreign listings this year.
In light of the squeeze on credit - the authorities have placed a ban on
bank lending for new capital spending - pressures to be allowed to venture
into international capital markets are certain to grow. China's evolving
regulatory apparatus faces no easy task in a surging transitional economy
undergoing a rapid and somewhat chaotic transformation to a market-oriented
system.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Focus on Greenspan testimony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following last week's Bundesbank-led easing of monetary policy across
Europe, attention now switches to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US
Federal Reserve, who delivers his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the House
Banking sub-committee tomorrow.
Mr Greenspan's bi-annual appearance, where he is called to explain his views
on the economy, will be watched for indications of the likely future course
of US monetary policy. The Fed lifted interest rates by 25 basis points
earlier this month, the first tightening of policy in five years.
Although that move was well received, the dollar has subsequently weakened
on the back of a trade dispute with Japan. The dollar last week fell to a
six month low of Y101 against the yen and was generally weaker across the
board.
Since the tightening of policy, US economic data has presented a mixed
picture, leading some to wonder whether the Fed might not have moved
prematurely. Weakness in US bond prices, however, shows that many investors
believe the Fed will respond to some inflationary signs with a further
tightening. Given this uncertainty, Mr Greenspan is sure to be closely
questioned to ascertain his views on the outlook for inflation and interest
rates.
In Europe attention will focus on Germany and France. While last week's cut
in the discount rate by the Bundesbank has paved the way for a cut in its
key repo rate, few see this happening until the wage dispute in the
engineering industry is resolved.
France, meanwhile, was the only key EMS country not to cut rates last week.
Thursday's meeting of the council of the Bank of France will provide an
opportunity to fall into line. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Citibank, argues that pressures are building on France to ease policy.
The G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers takes place in
Frankfurt on Saturday. US/Japan trade tensions will probably top the agenda.
The meeting may provide the spur for Japanese proposals aimed at breaking
the logjam.

<TEXT>
STRATEGY
Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley has put his bet on Poland as eastern
Europe's answer to a 'tiger economy'. Addressing himself to a longer time
horizon than many analysts - in a research paper called '2001: an investment
odyssey' - the global strategist suggests that the Czech and Hungarian
republics will also do well, 'but unlike Poland they do not offer the double
advantage of having a large and growing market, as well as a cheap
manufacturing base.'
As for emerging markets in general, he forecasts that several of the world's
restructuring economies will fail to transform: 'this could damage the
emerging markets mania sweeping the investment world.'
POLAND
Poland's finance minister is to ask the stock exchange authorities to
consider suspending trading in Bank Slaski until all investors obtain equal
access.
On Thursday the bank had its stockbroking licence revoked by the securities
commission following charges that it had mismanaged its own privatisation.
It has been given six months to wind down its operations.
Ing of the Netherlands has a 25.9 per cent stake in the bank.
KENYA
The government has scrapped several foreign currency controls, to bring the
country close to its declared aim of total liberalisation. Kenyans living
overseas will be allowed unlimited local borrowing to finance local
investment, and restrictions on local borrowing by foreign-controlled
companies will also be lifted.
Controls remain on capital accounts and rules barring foreign investors from
trading on the Nairobi stock market.
ISRAEL
The stock market closed down 6 per cent last week, depressed by the recent
arrest of two portfolio investment managers by the securities authority on
suspicion of manipulating securities for the eight companies they managed. A
third person, Mr Amos Weiss, a leading portfolio manager with some Shk1bn
(some Dollars 335m) under management, was released on bail last week also
after questioning on suspicion of stock manipulation.
NIGERIA
Activity on the stock exchange was slightly more muted in 1993 than in the
previous year, the authorities reported last week. According to the latest
estimates shares put on 39 per cent in 1993 compared with a 41 per cent rise
in 1992.
The stock exchange also reported that 21 new companies were listed on the
daily official list in 1993, up from 12 in 1992. At present there are 175
listed companies, with a market capitalisation of N50.5bn.
ROMANIA
Holders of vouchers will be able to swap them for shares in 20 state
enterprises from May, when the Private Ownership Fund issues its first list
of companies to be privatised through public offerings. The country's five
regional funds hold a 30 per cent stake in some 6,000 state enterprises
designated for privatisation over the next seven to 15 years.
BUDAPEST
The government has drawn up a short list of privatisation consultants to
help float shares of Matav, the telecommunications group, on the Budapest
stock exchange by the middle of this year.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Markets: A difficult task for testimony - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fundamental US economic factors should simultaneously be strengthening the
dollar over the next few months. The economy is expanding at a relatively
strong clip - many economists are forecasting GDP growth of 3 to 3 1/2 per
cent this year - and the Federal Reserve has started to tighten monetary
policy.
However, the central bank, which raised the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis
points at the start of this month, may have to tighten another notch or two
before it allays the jitters which have overtaken the Treasury bond market
over the past few weeks.
After a sharp drop in price on Friday, the benchmark 30-year issue ended
last week with a yield of 6.62 per cent, up from 6.40 a week earlier, and
some market analysts now think yields could rise to between 6.75 and 7 per
cent before stabilising and reversing direction, and that could feed through
to a significant dip in equity indices.
The bond market has yet to be convinced that inflationary pressures are
under control. This was graphically demonstrated on Thursday when bearish
traders brushed aside a healthy January reading for the consumer price index
and focussed instead on a much more narrow measure of price increases, from
the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Board, which showed a significant increase.
The week's fall in the dollar relative to the yen will also have fed fears
of imported inflation.
The market may not regain its composure until there is a run of slow-growth
statistics, or until after further rounds of Fed tightening, which could
nevertheless be bearish for bonds in the short term. Many analysts expect
the Fed Funds rate to rise from 3.25 per cent to 3.5 over the next two
months, with some predicting 4 per cent by mid-year.
However, short-term sentiment could be powerfully affected on Tuesday by Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who will deliver his semi-annual
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on monetary policy to Congress. At the very
least, he is expected to reaffirm his recent testimony before a
Congressional committee that the strength of the economic expansion means
the Fed must become less 'accomodative.'
Huffing and puffing the Yen up
Is the time fast approaching to sell the Japanese Yen? The question is
prompted by the surge in the currency relative to the dollar over the past
week following the breakdown of US-Japanese trade talks and threats by
Washington to take fresh trade sanctions against Tokyo.
The coming week will produce a great deal more huffing and puffing from the
two capitals, and this is likely to keep the relationship between the
currencies volatile, with the possibility of further Yen appreciation from
the rate of 104.60 to the dollar reached in late Friday trading.
The Yen's sharp rise stems from the market's expectation that Washington
will 'talk up' the Japanese currency to put negotiating pressure on the
Hosokawa Government. And the mere anticipation of such a move has obviated
the need for overt action by the US, which has sat back and tacitly accepted
the Yen's advance.
This week the Clinton administration is expected to unveil tougher action to
force the Japanese to accept numerical import quotas and reduce their trade
surplus.
In Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan has been intervening heavily to hold back
the Yen's advance, the Government is reported to be drafting voluntary trade
concessions in an attempt to head off the dispute, and it may want to have a
plan ready by next Saturday, when Finance Ministers from the G7 nations meet
in Frankfurt.
The market suspects the Japanese may ask the G7 to intervene to support a
rate of Y110 to the dollar, which officials in Tokyo argue is more
reflective of economic fundamentals.
Certainly, as Ravi Bulchandani of Goldman Sachs points out, the real
effective yen exchange rate is well above any level that the currency has
been able to sustain in the past.
And prolonged continuation of the current rate will hurt the Hosokawa
administration, undermining its economic stimulus package, hitting corporate
profitability and stock prices, and possibly prolonging recession.
US policy-makers face a trade-off between a desire to squeeze genuine trade
concessions out of Japan, and the knowledge that prolonging recession there
is ultimately harmful to US exports and geo-political interests.
Tokyo, for its part, seems to have two central policy options. One is to
give considerable ground to the US on trade issues, while appearing to stand
firm on numerical targets to shore up the Government's weak domestic
political position.
The other is to take pressure off both the yen and the domestic economy by a
further cut in interest rates. Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of
Japan, maintained last week that interest rates were sufficiently low to
support economic activity, but many analysts in Tokyo expect easing action
in the near future. Whatever the policy mix, it should exert downward
pressure on the yen.
Bundesbank action
The dollar should strengthen against European currencies over the next few
months as European interest rates continue to fall and as political
uncertainty mounts in Germany, with the approach of lander and national
elections.
The downward trend of European rates was reconfirmed on Thursday with the
Bundesbank's announcement of a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate,
which may have been delayed a couple of weeks as the bank weighed up the
impact on the D-Mark of the Fed's tightening action.
In the event, the dollar has been sliding against the D-Mark, dragged down
by its yen weakness, and the fall perversely persisted to the end of last
week, despite the Bundesbank's rate cutting action.
However, it may be a week or two before the Bundesbank cuts its most
important instrument, the repo rate, which it left unchanged at 6 per cent.
It could be holding back until it sees further progress in talks to avert
national engineering strikes, better inflation figures, or the March 1
implementation of a cut in commercial banks' minimum reserves.
SG Warburg's international bonds team argues that with inflation likely to
fall from 3.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent by the end of the year, there is a
good chance the discount rate will fall at least 1 per cent further towards
a trough early in 1995 of 4 per cent, with the repo rate about 25 basis
points higher.
Although the Bundesbank's action was widely imitated across Europe on
Thursday, France failed to match the cut.
But the weakness of the French economy means that it will surely follow suit
before long, possibly waiting for the repo rate to drop first.
Bullish on Japan
Could the current strength of the yen be due in small part to foreign
investors, who have been substantially underweight in Japanese stocks,
placing an early bet on economic recovery? A straw in the wind could be the
latest thinking of Morgan Stanley strategist Barton Biggs, who thinks the
pivotal economic event of the year in certain respects 'will not be the
gradual rise in US interest rates, but rather an unexpected and strong
economic recovery in Japan". In Biggs' view, such a revival would be bullish
for the world economy, Japanese stocks, Australia (Japan's natural resource
supplier), oil prices and maybe Malaysia (natural gas, tin, palm oil).
But it could be bearish for Japanese bonds, the yen (as the trade surplus
shrinks), and Hong Kong and other markets where Japanese money has gone. He
cautions that the government's economic stimulus programme and the survival
of the prime minister are in doubt, but 'even depressions and secular bear
markets don't last forever, and stock market bottoms are built from
discouragement and despair'.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Markets: No advantage in pseudo-scientific futurology -
Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The willingness of newspapers to report the outpourings of model-based
forecasters gives economists a terribly bad name. If manipulating giant and
complex statistical models of the world economy delivered reliable results,
then all would be fine. But the recent record of the UK Treasury, the
International Monetary Fund or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development has been miserable.
Anyone who doubts just how bad these models are at predicting cyclical
turning points only need glance at the upper chart for a damning
confirmation.
Economics is just not suited to the kind of pseudo-scientific futurology
that these models purport to deliver. Engineering scientists can use theory
and the results of controlled experiments to make accurate predictions
about, say, the weight a bridge will bear before it falls. But economists do
not have the tools, or the information, that the engineer has to work with
when they try, for example, to predict with any accuracy when the aggregate
consumer savings ratio will fall.
Economic theory provides a powerful conceptual framework, but much of it is
based on implausible assumptions about the rationality of human responses.
Study of the statistical past can indicate plausible causal relationships,
but testing an economic inference about aggregate consumer behaviour using
controlled experiments is almost always impossible.
Not that economists can afford to stop trying to predict the future. But, if
economists are useful to have around, it is because of their
deeply-ingrained scepticism, their willingness to doubt assumptions or ask
whether the conclusions really follow.
The best UK City economists, most of whom eschew large-scale models, are
successful precisely because they continually doubt whether the future will
be like the past. Their value lies in analysis, although it their forecasts
which make the headlines.
The problem with the OECD and other large-scale forecasters, aside from
their ridiculous claims to accuracy, is that their statistical models always
require them to look back to the future, finding patterns in the past to
predict how tomorrow will be. In this recession, albeit a little late, OECD
economists produced some typically good analysis of the historically
unprecedented debt burdens facing UK, US or Japanese companies and
consumers. But the implications for the pace of recovery were not
incorporated into their forecasts, at least not until the OECD's woefully
erroneous forecasts had done terrible damage to its forecasting reputation.
Yet the danger really starts when macro modellers graduate to policy making
and try to elevate past statistical relationships to orthodox policy
doctrine. Remember, for example, the UK Treasury's repeated statements
during the final months of sterling's membership of the European exchange
rate mechanism. In or out for the ERM, the UK could not cut interest rates
below those in Germany they said. Even a modest devaluation would inevitably
lead to higher inflation, they feared.
Neither assertion seemed plausible at the time, given the depressed state of
the UK economy. And both have been proved wrong since. But the Treasury has
still not cottoned on. Worried about the resurgence of post-devaluation
inflation, it has cut rates much more modestly than the US Federal Reserve
has done with no apparent inflationary cost. If growth remains sluggish, the
Treasury will eventually sanction further cuts, although history suggests
they will come too late and stay low too long.
The failure of the IMF to engage with Russian reformers or provide funds for
a successful stabilisation provides another example of the shortcomings of
model-based, rule-bound, apolitical economics. The IMF has doggedly clung to
the details of its standard programme, tried and tested in Latin America,
which makes any release of funds conditional on the prior closing of the
budget deficit, even though state spending cuts and the associated rise in
unemployment were politically impossible in Russia.
But, as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University has repeatedly pointed
out, there is nothing inherently inflationary about a budget deficit so long
as it is financed by external finance rather than printing money. The point
of western aid should have been to stabilise the price level before the
government started the painful task of cutting state subsidies. To make aid
a reward for success has merely made failure inevitable.
Prof Sachs criticism of the IMF is a good example of economics at its best,
challenging conventional wisdom not with the black box of an econometric
model but through a close study of all the available evidence. Economic
analysis is most powerful when it pieces together a number of theoretical
insights and statistical relations to build a convincing alternative view.
Take the Ross Perot charge that import penetration from developing countries
is undermining employment in US manufacturing industry. Is he right? No, say
Robert Lawrence and Paul Krugman of Harvard and MIT, the decline in
manufacturing is much greater than can be explained by trade penetration, as
the lower chart shows. Yes, says Adrian Wood of Sussex University, for their
alternative explanation - technological change favouring skilled workers -
is also driven by the threat of external competition.
Whether the question is how to aid Russia, why consumer spending is so
sluggish or the case for wage subsidies in east Germany, the same
methodology works best. Macro modellers, be they the OECD, the IMF or the
Treasury, should put away their crystal balls and get back to economics.
This is Edward Balls' last column. He is leaving the FT to become economics
adviser to the UK shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown MP.

FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: German groups reluctant to list
/ Examining a deep-seated cultural aversion of family-owned companies to the
stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last summer, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank,
made a brave prognosis. He predicted that in the medium to long-term,
between 1,500 and 2,000 companies would come to the German stock market
In retrospect, his prediction looks excessively optimistic. In spite of
buoyant stock market conditions last year, only 11 companies went public -
up from seven in 1992 but down from the 19 new issues in 1991 and 26 in
1990. Following last year's listings, the number of companies quoted on the
eight German stock exchanges is now a modest 664.
Collectively, Germany's quoted companies had a market capitalisation of
about DM800bn (Dollars 466bn) at the end of last year. This represents 30 to
35 per cent of Germany's GDP - far less than in the UK, the US, Japan or
Hong Kong, where the stock markets account for between 60 and more than 100
per cent of GDP.
These figures show that Germany's stock market, however popular with
international investors last year (the DAX index of 30 leading shares rose
46.7 per cent in 1993) is underdeveloped.
The capitalisation of the German market is only the third largest in Europe
 -although Germany is Europe's largest economy. The total number of new
issues in Germany over the last 10 years has been about 200 - compared with
180 in the UK last year alone.
'We looked on with envy at the number of new issues in the UK last year,'
said Mr Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse (the German
stock exchange).
This lack of development means that investors are denied the opportunity to
buy into important sectors of the German economy, such as food manufacturing
or services, because there are few quoted companies in these sectors.
There are at least 2,000 German manufacturing companies with turnover of
DM100m or more, that being the size at which the owners of such companies
could bring them to the stock market in they wanted to.
The problem is, as the meagre new issue statistics show, few owners of such
companies want to bring them to the market. Why should this be?
One consideration is that domestic institutional shareholders - pension
funds and insurance companies which are the natural buyers of new issue
shares - are thin on the ground in Germany.
In 1990, when the Bundesbank last published a study of the ownership
structure of the German stock market, such institutions owned just 12 per
cent of the market - compared with 55 per cent in the UK.
If institutional investors are under-represented on the German stock market,
so are private households, whose share of stock market ownership dropped
from 27 per cent in 1960 to 17 per cent in 1990.
In the case of new issues, investors' suspicions have been underscored by
aggressive pricing. A recent study from Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, the
German bank owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK, shows that new issues have not
proved to be very rewarding investments over 1992 - 93. Only two of the 1992
new issues outperformed the market last year, while two fell in price and
one went bankrupt.
If these factors explain why there is limited demand for shares in new
companies, they do not address the problem of supply. Owners of large
'mittelstand' companies could overcome these hurdles if they wanted to. That
they do not reflects a deep-seated cultural aversion to the stockmarket.
'Why should I share my independence with anyone else,' asks Mr Reinhold
Wurth, proprietor of the Wurth group, a distributor of screws, fasteners and
other products used by the building trade. With turnover of more than DM3bn
and unbroken profits growth over 40 years, it could easily float. 'But why
should I take such a step as long as I can cover my growth with profits and
cash flow?' Mr Wurth said.
This sentiment is expressed time and time again by family owners of
companies which in the US or the UK would almost without exception be
listed.
The reason is that the move from private company to quote company status
forces a reorientation of priorities. 'It is a big step from managing the
business with a view to paying as small a tax bill as possible to generating
profits for outside shareholders,' says an official at Commerzbank.
'Owners do not want the publicity associated with a quote,' he says. 'They
are not particularly interested in money, either - they are rich enough
already. They are more concerned not to lose their special position within
their local community and are acutely conscious that their power and
influence will disappear. If they sell, they become merely rich - as the
proprietor of a company they really are somebody.'
Even when a family decides to list, it rarely abandons control to the
vagaries of the stock market. Thus the BMW group - majority-owned by the
Quandt family - can enjoy the benefits of the stock market without changing
its essential character as a (very large) family business.
Analysts predict that the number of new issues will accelerate towards the
end of the current decade. But it seems unlikely that an Anglo-American
'equity culture' will be take root in Germany until well into the 21st
century.

FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft chief to
spell out future strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled Frankfurt-based metals, mining and
industrial group which came to the brink of collapse last month, will give
the first full account of its future strategy this week following its
DM3.4bn (Dollars 1.98bn) rescue package - and the first detailed explanation
of the events which led to near disaster.
Tomorrow, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the troubleshooter appointed as chief
executive in December last year, will hold his first press conference since
he took over from the sacked Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch.
Having kept his silence until now, but for a few sentences uttered for the
benefit of the television cameras and a handful of short press releases, he
will outline his plans for the group, which has 58,000 employees working at
258 subsidiaries. He has already said there will be massive redundancies and
that numerous subsidiaries will be sold - details will emerge tomorrow.
On Thursday, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is also
chairman of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board, will preside over an
extraordinary shareholders' meeting. There are formal legal reasons for the
meeting following the departure of Mr Schimmelbusch and other boardroom
colleagues, but the supervisory board is expected to seize the opportunity
to defend its own conduct throughout the affair.
While tomorrow's press conference is expected to focus on
Metallgesellschaft's future, the annual meeting on Thursday will concentrate
on the past. Mr Schmitz is likely to face a grilling from aggrieved
shareholders anxious to know how it was that the supervisory board -
consisting of some of the most distinguished names in German business -
could have failed to prevent the near catastrophe.
The crisis was triggered by MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's US trading
subsidiary, whose activities in the oil futures markets are expected to give
rise to a DM1.5bn loss in the current financial year.
Critics will argue at the meeting that beyond the immediate causes of
Metallgesellschaft's problems there is evidence of a 'system failure'
reflecting the close relations between big German banks and the company. 'If
they didn't know what was going on, they failed in their duty to supervise,'
said the chief economist of a foreign bank in Frankfurt. 'If they did know,
there was a cover-up and that is equally bad.
'The problem is that the members of German supervisory boards are
self-selecting; they are members of a club,' the economist continued.
'Shareholders are formally supposed to control the supervisory boards via
the way they vote at annual meetings. But this does not work because the
banks own big stakes themselves and can vote large stakes on behalf of other
shareholders who lodge their shares for custody at the banks.
'Criticism has tended to be dismissed until now but the Metallgesellschaft
case shows that there is a weakness which threatens the fabric of the German
economy,' he concluded.
Mr Schmitz has been praised by fellow board members for the energetic way he
has led the supervisory board at Metallgesellschaft since he took over as
chairman last April. He is likely to argue on Thursday that he was entitled
be kept informed by the management board but that he was not kept in the
picture.

year

<TEXT>
Sega, the Japanese video games group, has warned that pre-tax profits will
drop this financial year, the first fall in 12 years. The company blamed the
decline on the strong yen and the recession in Europe, which led to fierce
price competition.
Pre-tax profits will fall by 24 per cent this year from Y55bn to Y42.5bn
(Dollars 407m), it said. In November, the company forecast a rise to
Y57.5bn. Turnover, which was expected to increase from Y346bn to Y380bn,
will only reach Y351bn, it added.
The group said it expects profits to increase in the next financial year,
helped by the opening of a series of theme parks in Osaka, Yokohama and
Chiba. It also has plans for a joint venture with Universal to open a park
in the US.
Profits next year will also be boosted by the launch of a new home
multimedia video game system called Saturn using 32-bit microprocessors.
Current consoles use 16-bit technology.
Sega forecast consolidated sales for the year to March 31 of Y385bn,
compared with a previous estimate of Y480bn and last year's figure of
Y416bn. Consolidated pre-tax profits would be Y20.5bn, compared with the
previous forecast of Y65bn, and last year's result of Y57.4bn.
The international credit reputation of corporate Japan was further damaged
when Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) was stripped of its triple-A rating by
Standard  Poor's, the international credit rating agency. About Dollars
38bn of rated debt is affected, writes Antonia Sharpe.
The one-notch cut in Tepco's senior debt rating to double-A plus follows a
series of downgradings over the past year of some of Japan's best-known
companies, including Nissan, American Honda and Sony.
SP said the downgrade of Tepco's rating, which has now been removed from
CreditWatch, reflects the erosion of its financial profile.

<TEXT>
Air Canada, having settled its two-year dispute with rival Canadian
International over ticket reservation systems, is 'on the way back to
profitability in 1994,' says Mr Hollis Harris, chairman, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
An improving North American airline market, new international and regional
routes and more gains in productivity should make the turnround possible, he
said in a preliminary report for 1993.
The airline posted losses for the three previous years. Operating results in
1993 showed a profit of CDollars 77m (USDollars 57m) against a loss of
CDollars 145m in 1992. But after special items totalling CDollars 263m,
there was a final net loss of CDollars 326m, or CDollars 4.23 a share,
against a loss of CDollars 454m, or CDollars 6.13.
The special items included a CDollars 80m provision for its remaining
investment in GPA, CDollars 31m for its investment in the Gemini reservation
system and CDollars 76m for further staff cuts.

Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, has decided to withdraw from the Belgian
market and sell its insurance activities there to Almanij-Kredietbank, the
Belgian savings bank group, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Neither company would disclose the price commanded by Aegon's Belgian
insurance business, which generates annual premium income of around BFr3.5bn
(Dollars 95m).
The transaction will more than double Almanij's premium income from
insurance activities to BFr8bn.
Aegon said it was withdrawing from Belgium because of the absence of
expansion opportunities and the fact that its insurance activities lacked
the necessary critical mass.

FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Endesa plans share offer to
raise further Pta200bn

<TEXT>
Endesa, Spain's partially -privatised state-controlled electricity
distributor and generator, is to put 10 per cent of its equity on the market
in the first half of this year in an international public offering worth an
estimated Pta200bn (Dollars 1.43bn).
The offering, which will be managed by Goldman Sachs of the US, and
Argentaria, the government-controlled domestic banking group, will have a
domestic retail tranche and one aimed at international institutions. It is
understood that a separate tranche, representing just over half the total
equity offered, could be placed with National Power of the UK and with
Germany's RWE.
INI, the public sector conglomerate which owns Endesa, placed 23 per cent of
the utility on the market in 1988 and a further 10 per cent two years ago on
the New York Stock Exchange in the form of ADRs.
Endesa's group 1993 net profit was Pta116.8bn, up 9.9 per cent from the
previous year. Earnings per share rose to Pta449.3 from Pta408.
A further partial privatisation by Endesa had been expected this year to
offset an escalating general government deficit that threatens to rise to
8.5 per cent of GDP against an official 6.4 per cent target. Other offerings
of government-controlled equity to raise revenue this year could include
Telefonica Internacional, the international unit of the domestic
telecommunications group, and Tabacalera, the tobacco group.
Last year, as recession began to make strong inroads on the budget, the
government's energy conglomerate Repsol, again advised by Goldman Sachs,
realised Pta110bn when it placed 13 per cent of its equity on the market,
and Argentaria, using Morgan Stanley as its global co-ordinator, realised
Pta290bn in two public share offerings that brought public ownership of the
banking group down to 50 per cent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Honda may hold the ace when cards are
revealed / The future of Rover as talks between BMW and Honda start today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the three weeks since Rover was sold to BMW, the German car maker and
Honda Motor, Rover's partner for 15 years, have been eyeing each other
closely to see which will blink first.
The poker game begins in earnest today in Tokyo as Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
BMW's chairman, begins talks with Mr Nibuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president.
Both parties have powerful cards to play.
Honda's wounded pride and loss of face caused by British Aerospace's sale of
its 80 per cent stake in Rover might suggest a complete severing of Honda's
links with Rover.
Honda, in fact, has the power in its Rover agreements to shut down much of
Rover. It can give seven days' notice to cancel its key contracts if Rover
was sold to another party.
That, however, would fly in the face of commercial common sense, at least in
the medium term. It has too much to lose from selling parts to Rover and,
anyway, the relationship cannot physically be unpicked overnight.
But BMW's wish that 'in this new scenario Rover Cars will naturally continue
its agreements with Honda in every respect', is just as unlikely to come to
pass.
BMW wants Rover, for example, to give it a market presence in the
lower-medium front-wheel drive sector. Rover plans to launch next year a
replacement to its 200/400 series, jointly developing the model with Honda
in Project Theta. Yet, the partners are understood to have failed yet to
sign a full production agreement, and Honda could baulk.
Honda sees the German car maker as one of its most potent rivals in the
world car market, and it is impossible to expect that Honda's doors can now
remain as open to Rover.
Assuming Honda does not plump for the 'doomsday' scenario, there there are
three levels of collaboration between Honda and Rover, which the Japanese
car maker and BMW must now address:
licensing agreements on original Honda products;
the selling and buying of components;
production and technology transfer from Honda to Rover.
These links are cemented by Honda's 20 per cent equity stake in the whole of
the Rover vehicle operations (including Land Rover) and Rover's 20 per cent
stake in Honda's UK assembly plant at Swindon.
Licensing: Most of Rover's cars are based on or dependent on Honda designs
and are produced under direct licence from Honda. These agreements can be
terminated at three months' notice.
Whole vehicles subject to them are the Rover 600 and 400 models. But Rover
has greater leeway on the 200 hatchback. Because the 200 was a jointly
developed vehicle, Rover enjoys component supply contracts for as long as it
builds the current model.
This anomaly arose because the Honda Concerto model, on which the Rover
200/400 range is based, appeared in Japan first as a saloon, and the 400 was
licensed directly from it, whereas the 200 was developed jointly.
Typical of critical component issues is the gearbox used on Rover's own two
litre engines. This is a Honda product made under licence by Rover at its
Longbridge plant in Birmingham. Withdrawal of its licence could disrupt much
of the rest of Rover's car range apart from the ageing Montego, Maestro,
Metro and Mini models.
The 800 executive car range would be affected even though the car itself has
long since diverged from the Honda Legend, on which it was based. However,
Honda must supply other key components in it - notably the 2.7 litre Honda
V6 engine - for as long as Rover wants to build the car.
Buying and selling components: this is a normal arm's length
customer-supplier relationship for most components, involving two-way
transactions of close to Pounds 400m a year. For example, Honda sells facias
to Rover for the Rover 600 and Rover sells Honda the body panels  - produced
at Rover's Swindon stamping plant - for the Honda Accord, which Honda
produces at its own assembly plant in Swindon.
The contracts state supplies must continue for as long as each partner is
producing a particular model.
However, these contracts are subservient to the licensing agreements. Honda
considers that it could legitimately pull the plug on much of Rover's model
range, even though Rover could still be legally required to continue
providing body panels for the Accord. But pulling the plug would severely
disrupt production at Honda's own plant in Swindon.
Manufacturing and technology transfer: much of the equipment and tooling
used by Rover to build the 600 and 200/400 were developed and supplied by
Honda.
The equipment was replicated and transferred into Rover's Longbridge plant,
thus saving Rover heavy expenditures on developing production facilities for
new models. A highly sophisticated multi-welder for body shells, for
example, is from Honda Engineering. If Honda terminated the relevant
agreements, however, Rover could maintain the equipment adequately for the
life of current models.
Another key element of the relationship is the maintenance of the component
supplier base. Honda manages its supplier base of 160 companies on behalf of
itself and Rover, and Rover does the same with its suppliers feeding Rover's
plants and Honda's at Swindon.
The overall appearance of cars might not change but their parts are updated
constantly as part of the Japanese-inspired philosophy of continuous
improvement.
Lack of access by either partner to the database which keeps track of 20,000
parts could bring chaos to production lines as component mismatches
proliferated.
One measure of the trust Honda and Rover had developed is that the database
for the Accord/Rover 600 is managed and maintained only by Honda at Swindon.
Working relationships: Honda believes BMW may not have understood how
dependent Rover is on Honda, and how close working relations had become.
'Honda-Rover is not only a business-based corporate relationship', according
to one senior Honda executive in Europe. 'So many engineers, so many
managers and so many production people have worked closely together for 15
years. This working together is a quite unique experience for the Japanese
people as well as the British and I believe that it could create very good
mutual understanding between our two cultures.
'For most of the people involved in this collaboration it has been not only
their job but their life, including their families.'
Some 150 Rover personnel went to Japan to learn production start-up
techniques for the Rover 200/400. And some 40 Japanese Honda staff and their
families went to Birmingham to stay for nearly three years in getting the
project off the ground.
When Honda asked Rover to build its Concerto model at Longbridge, Honda
opened its factories to Rover staff to allow them to feed back quality
information. The information exchange has accelerated ever since. 'So there
is not only information exchange in the conference room there was
hand-to-hand working together on the shop floor', the Honda executive said.
For its part, BMW can offer Honda the lucrative opportunity of continuing to
work with Rover and, for example, to supply Land-Rover Discovery four-wheel
drive vehicles with Honda badges for the Japanese market.
But Honda is sure of its bargaining power. As one senior Honda executive put
it informally: 'We hold a card hand of nine aces - but the British public
does not know this fact.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: 74 per cent of Europa Minerals'
shareholders accept Burmine offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 15m offer for Europa Minerals, the UK-quoted mining finance
house, was accepted by holders of 74.4 per cent of the issued capital by the
first closing date, according to its adviser Samuel Montagu.
Montagu said that acceptances included 5.5 per cent of Europa held by SBN
Nominees and beneficially owned by Mount Edon Gold, the Australian company
which previously opposed the merger. Mount Edon has also made a hostile bid
for Burmine, the Australian group making the recommended offer for Europa.
However, Mount Edon's financial public relations advisers in London said
there must be another explanation for SBN's acceptance as Mount Edon would
not have accepted the Burmine offer for any of its Europa shares. Mount Edon
owns 19.9 per cent of the UK company.
Burmine's offer has been extended until March 4 but the merger - a three-way
affair also involving Austmin Gold, another Australian company, for which
Burmine has made a friendly bid - cannot be completed until the result of
various legal actions in Australia are known. Montagu said these might be
cleared away this week.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Oyston puts Trans World stake up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Owen Oyston, the flamboyant businessman who owns Blackpool Football Club,
has put up for sale his 24 per cent stake in Trans World Communications, the
independent radio group. A further 4 per cent, owned by associates of Mr
Oyston, are also on the market.
The move is likely to trigger a battle for control of the company involving
Emap, the publishing group which owns almost 30 per cent of the shares, and
the Guardian newspaper group, which has 20 per cent.
Under the current rules on cross-media ownership the Guardian could not
increase its shareholding. But it might seek a 'safe' home for Mr Oyston's
stake in the expectation that the rules will soon be relaxed.
Were Emap to buy the stake and so take control, it is thought it would have
to sell one of Trans World's stations to stay within the limits on market
share. Trans World owns Piccadilly in Manchester, Red Rose in Lancashire,
Red Dragon in South Wales and Aire in West Yorkshire. Emap already owns the
Liverpool station Radio City.
Since letting it be known that the stake was up for sale Mr Oyston said that
'some quite seriously interested parties' had contacted him.
He needs the money to fund the Pounds 50m first phase of his long-planned
redevelopment of Blackpool's stadium where planning permission 'now looks
almost certain'.
Trans World's shares, which closed up 11p at 159p on Friday, have risen by
60 per cent in the last three weeks.
Mr Oyston is looking to sell the stake at a premium to Friday's market price
which valued the holding at almost Pounds 15m.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Unipalm to market via Pounds 5.5m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unipalm, a Cambridge-based computer communications company, is coming to
market by way of a placing to raise approximately Pounds 5.5m net of
expenses. Sponsored by Henry Cooke Corporate Finance, it is expected to
value the company at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m.
Unipalm, now eight years old, is a leading UK specialist in methods of
attaching commercial organisations to a global computer network known as the
Internet. The potential of the Internet remains comparatively untapped in
the UK, but interest is growing rapidly in the US.
Unipalm has two principal operating companies. One distributes
interconnection software while the other, Pipex, founded in January 1992,
specialises in Internet connection. Pipex is under contract to the BBC to
provide a low cost Internet connection to accompany a new series 'The Net',
scheduled for April.
In the year to April 30, 1993 the distribution business made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 897,000 on Pounds 8m sales. In the first half of the current year,
pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 461,000 on sales of Pounds 4.35m.
Pipex, however, incurred Pounds 308,000 losses on sales of Pounds 381,000 in
its first year and a further Pounds 313,000 on sales of Pounds 592,000 in
the first half of the current year. Overall, the group made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 148,000 on sales of Pounds 4.94m.
The company has some 200 customers including Dixons and Pilkington
representing 70 per cent of the UK commercial Internet market. Recurrent
revenues from these customers are running at Pounds 1.5m a year.
Mr Peter Dawe, a Unipalm co-founder and now Pipex managing director, said
funds were being raised to expand the Internet interconnection business,
currently expanding at 100 per cent a year. He believed growth rates of
treble that amount a year were possible, admittedly from a low base point.
The Internet is not a single system but a self-regulating collection of over
14,000 networks across the globe. It has its origins in academic and defence
networks in the US and has been seen principally as a low cost electronic
mail system for hobbyists.
During the 1991 Soviet coup it was credited with providing a reliable path
for information in and out of Moscow.

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pulling the global pearls together - Cable
and Wireless' investment strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT comment last June that Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications
group, has 'pearls scattered around the world but lacks a thread to pull
them together,' reflected the thinking of some of the company's senior
executives.
Mr James Ross - the urbane and determined former chairman of BP America
brought in as chief executive two years ago by CW's chairman, Lord Young -
insists the company has now discovered the string to tie together a host of
activities from Mercury in the UK to Optus in Australia, the challenger to
the former Antipodean state telecoms monopoly.
'We are not just a holding company for a diverse range of telecoms
activities: we make sense as a federation, and intend to strengthen the
bonds between the different parts,' said Mr Ross.
CW, he argues, is currently undervalued because it does not attract the
premium it deserves as a sum of more than its parts.
The essential bond the company has now discovered is a 'coherent investment
strategy' giving pride of place to growth in the Asia-Pacific region. This
is the home of Hong Hong Telecom, CW's richest pearl, which accounted last
year for Pounds 554m of its Pounds 829m operating profit.
Mr Ross spells out what this priority means: a commitment 'over the medium
term' to devote Hong Kong Telecom's free cash flow to investments in the
Asia-Pacific.
'Outside Hong Kong we have underinvested in the area and we are now intent
on growing other Asian opportunities.'
Mr Ross highlighted opportunities to build and operate networks in
under-developed Asian markets. China is the 'great object' but, with
telecoms racing ahead in all parts of the region, 'not the sole magnet.'
'Other companies' - for which read BT and ATT in their ambitions to be
global providers to the multinationals - 'don't really go in for those
(construction projects). We are playing a different competitive game, which
is not the big multinationals.'
He is also explicit about CW's European strategy, which is two-pronged. In
the larger markets, like Germany and France, CW will be the 'Mercury in
Europe', building networks to challenge the monopolies of state operators as
liberalisation advances.
In the smaller markets, such as Ireland and Portugal, it is looking for
opportunities to partner existing monopoly operators.
'We don't believe there is enough room for a national competitor, and the
existing operators need an international player like us.'
What will unite the federation?
People, products and a global network capacity, said Mr Ross.
He pointed to the swapping of senior managers, like the recent exchange
between the deputy chief executives of Mercury and Hong Kong Telecom; and he
emphasised the convergence, in terms of services and marketing, of world
telecoms markets. 'Take Hong Kong: we have got competition there next year,
and intend to make full use of our experience as the under-dog in Britain in
facing it.'
Mr Ross's strategy faces an immediate objection.
As a company less than a third the size of BT, how is CW going to fund
serious expansion from three hubs worldwide - the third being the Caribbean
region? More-over, to make itself attractive to the Chinese, CW arguably
needs an image more regional than global.
Mr Ross implicitly accepted both points by playing down the investment
outlays to be expected outside Asia-Pacific, and stressing the trend towards
indigenous management, as reflected in the recent appointment of Mr Linus
Cheung, deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific Airways, as chief
executive of Hong Kong Telecom.
'Partnership is the key', said Mr Ross.
'We can't even try to operate on our own in many places, but we have
experience and networks that can bring a lot to any partnership, whether in
China or Germany.'
As for resources, he cited CW's low gearing (about 13 per cent), suggesting
an increase in spending from the current Pounds 1bn a year to Pounds 1.5bn
to be 'a responsible objective'.
The strategy has clear attractions. Partnership between indigenous and
overseas operators is the industry trend, from cellular mobile services in
Europe and the US to basic line-building ventures in Asia.
For governments and indigenous telecoms operators, CW has a top-notch name
without being one of the large, perhaps more threatening, US or European
forces.
The capacity to learn in one market to profit in another will give a
critical edge as competition advances. To benefit, it may not be size so
much as presence that matters, and CW's presence is more widely spread than
most.
But if Hong Telecom's free cash flow is to go into Asia, a question mark
must be raised over the European strand to CW's thread, particularly if
Mercury's profits are depressed by the explosion of competition in the UK.
As Mr Ross puts it: 'we don't have a home market: we only came back to the
UK in the last 10 years.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Granada rejects LWT argument in bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada yesterday dismissed LWT's defence against its hostile Pounds 800m
bid as 'strong on presentation but weak on content'.
In a final letter to LWT shareholders, Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman of
Granada, rejects LWT's argument that the offer undervalues the company
compared with the agreed takeovers of Central Independent Television and
Anglia.
Mr Bernstein says that Granada's offer represents 27.6 times LWT's estimated
1993 earnings, while the recommended offer from Carlton for Central
represented 25.1 times brokers' estimates for the target's 1993 earnings.
As for the price paid by MAI for Anglia, Mr Bernstein said that this was
justified because of Anglia's particularly valuable investments and because
it has much higher operational gearing than LWT.
He added that 'moreover, in 1993 Anglia's share of net advertising revenue
continued to increase, whereas LWT's share fell compared with 1992.'
Granada says that LWT bases much of its argument on one year's estimated
profits and Mr Bernstein warns LWT shareholders: 'You should question how
sustainable the rate of increase shown by LWT in its 1993 profits will prove
to be.'
The offer closes this Friday.

FT  21 FEB 94 / US rail group plans gold float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa Fe Pacific, the US railroad group, is expected soon to float its gold
subsidiary on terms that would give Santa Fe Gold Corporation a market value
of at least Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn).
Analysts suggest the stock market launch of Santa Fe Gold will follow
closely behind the eagerly-anticipated Dollars 1bn flotation in London and
Ghana of Ashanti Goldfields.
Santa Fe Gold includes some of the US assets Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, acquired with Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and swapped
last year for Santa Fe's coal and aggregate operations.
This deal transformed Santa Fe Gold into the sixth largest North American
gold producer with an anticipated 1994 output of 900,000 troy ounces. It
also has one of the biggest gold reserves in North America: 14m ounces.
Analysts expect the parent to do an IPO (initial public offering) of about
20 per cent of Santa Fe Gold to raise Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m. Santa Fe
would then dividend its entire holding to the parent group's shareholders so
by the end of this year the gold company would have a free float of 100 per
cent.
Santa Fe would not discuss the issue, probably because it felt constrained
by US regulations, but analysts were alerted in June when the group applied
for a ruling from the tax authorities that the distribution of the Santa Fe
Gold shares would be tax free. Such rulings typically take between six and
nine months to be made known.
Ms Lindsey Falconer, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of the Jardine
Fleming group, suggested the tax ruling was likely to be favourable but,
even it it was not, Santa Fe would go ahead with the IPO. She estimated the
gold subsidiary was worth Dollars 1.6bn or about Dollars 8.50 per Santa Fe
share.
'The stock looks very attractive when compared with other senior North
American producers, it will be seen as a core holding among the North
American gold shares and will be eligible for inclusion in the new Financial
Times Gold Index,' she said.
Santa Fe Gold now has three mines in northern Nevada: Lone Tree, Mesquite
and Twin Creeks (a combination of Hanson's Chimney Creek mine and Santa Fe's
Rabbit Creek). It is one of the biggest holders of minerals rights in the
western US - 7.2m acres in some of the most prospective regions, inherited
from its parent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The regulator armed with a horse-whip: Andrew Large talks to
Norma Cohen on the future of the investment industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Large, the bespectacled, slightly stoop-shouldered chief City
regulator is poking, prodding, coaxing and in some cases, horse-whipping the
investment industry into the 21st century.
His personal demeanor is more of a poodle than a Rottweiler but he is the
instigator of a radical shake-up of the investment industry for small
investors and large securities firms alike.
In the 18 months since he took on the role of chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board, he has forced an overhaul of the way retail financial
services are regulated despite the implacable hostility of the insurance
industry. This week, he will unveil the blueprint for the Personal
Investment Authority, the vehicle for far tougher oversight than yet
achieved.
And last week, he launched a review of the way wholesale markets operate and
suggested that, to make markets more efficient and competitive, professional
investors may have to give up some of the practices which have protected
their profits.
He concedes that some suggestions made in his report, couched in the
non-combative language of a discussion document, are radical. But he says
London must face the issues. 'All these issues have been addressed in the
US. Any financial centre that aspires to be a major financial centre must
answer these questions,' he says. 'If we don't do this, we are not doing our
duty.'
Moreover, he has announced a permanent group of securities regulators to
improve the ferreting out and punishment of wrongdoing in the securities
industry. Regulators ought to act as a 'street-wise support' to criminal
prosecutors, helping them obtain convictions.
Mr Large acknowledges as legitimate the public anger over the failure of the
criminal courts to convict and punish individuals widely accused of cheating
investors and says that something must be done.
Former colleagues say his boffin-like demeanor is misleading. 'He is out to
win,' says a colleague who worked closely with him at Swiss Bank Corporation
in London in the 1980s. 'And if he can't win, he'll get out.'
Proof of that, colleagues say, was his decision to quit the board of SBC
after two years, despite the prestige of having been the first foreigner
named to such a post.
'He came in early one morning and tried to make himself a cup of coffee. The
staff wouldn't let him do it - they said directors don't make coffee,' says
one former colleague.
Aside from the cultural differences, there were other difficulties over the
board's reluctance to consider expansion projects he thought necessary.
For his part, he speaks glowingly of his 10 years at SBC, during which time
he established the bank as a major force in international finance,
particularly in Eurobonds. But he does describe his years on the board as
'stressful'.
Former associates give fulsome praise to him for intellectual adroitness and
management skills. 'His organisational skills are second to none,' says one
ex-SBC official. Moreover, he was sufficiently international in character -
he was carted around the world as a child by his father, an army doctor - to
win business where others could not.
Former associates describe an almost complete lack of humour. Not one
recalls a joke or prank committed by him - a unique trait in the Eurobond
markets where absurd personalities abound. In an interview, he intoned with
a straight face that he could never be a doctor like his father because 'I
don't have any patience,' oblivious to his own pun.
An intensely private person, at first blush, he hardly appeared the catalyst
to shake up the investment industry when he was appointed to head the SIB in
June 1992.
A product of Winchester College and Cambridge University, his first job was
with British Petroleum which sent him to Malaysia. Back in London, he was in
charge of an abortive project to extract protein from fuel oil. The turning
point came, he says, when BP offered him the opportunity to train for an MBA
at Insead, the French management school.
Insead was wonderful, he says. 'It was totally international. You didn't
care where anyone was from.' The year there gave him his interest in
finance.
But he says BP refused to give him a job in finance because he wasn't an
accountant, and he jumped ship to work at Orion Bank, a consortium set up by
six foreign banks. After 10 years there, he was one of a group of five
poached by SBC in 1979 to set up international activities based in London.
While he was at SBC he first entered the regulatory arena. He was chairman
of the Securities Association, the precursor of the current self-regulatory
body and in that role, fought hard to reduce the regulatory burden on
professional investors envisaged in the newly-created Financial Services
Act.
He says he still believes professional markets require a different
regulatory approach than retail markets with their unsophisticated
investors.
Asked whether he still believes in self-regulation, he demurs. 'I don't
think self-regulation should be a theology.'
'If regulation is going to work so that investors are going to be protected
in an efficient manner then you must have practitioners involved in it.'
The extent to which practitioners should be involved in writing the City's
rules will be the stickiest question for the remainder of his term. His main
challenge will be to ensure that whatever the regulatory regime when his
term is over, City hearts and minds are in it too.

comparable profits of Pounds 3m in 1992.
Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK composites in recent years,
is expected to post profits of between Pounds 179m and Pounds 213m when it

Royal Insurance is expected to register profits of between Pounds 120m and

FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts focus on state of play
more than profits - ICI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI reports its first set of full-year figures since the demerger of Zeneca
last summer on Thursday.
Thanks largely to cost-cutting and currency gains profits before
exceptionals are expected to have doubled to between Pounds 270m and Pounds
300m.
Analysts' estimates for 1993 are in a tight range and attention will focus
on the company's comments about the state of its major markets.
It is expected to be quite positive about the US and UK but to report that
continental Europe remains very tough both in terms of volumes and prices.
Even if German interest rate cuts continue few observers expect much
recovery this year and a stronger pound would make ICI's life more
difficult. The recent failure of European manufacturers to agree on a
restructuring of ethylene production underlined the deep-rooted problems of
an industry dogged by overcapacity.
Analysts will be expecting an update on ICI's own restructuring programme,
which has meant hefty rationalisation costs over the past three years.
In 1992 the combined group reported a loss of Pounds 384m after exceptionals
of Pounds 949m. There are expected to have been further provisions last year
including a Pounds 100m charge associated with the proposed disposal of its
American composite materials business and Pounds 30m for the closure of
Electrochlor, its indirectly owned PVC manufacturer in Argentina. Analyst
Ian John at NatWest Securities predicts FRS3 pre-tax profits of Pounds 107m
after exceptionals.
Analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for the current year and,
unless ICI is more bullish than expected, most are likely to maintain their
view that the shares are now discounting its medium-term recovery potential.
The City is expecting unchanged dividends of 27.5p compared with underlying
earnings of about 22.5p.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Great expectations despite harder
 -Astra
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Satisfying investors' high expectations has become a familiar problem for
Astra as the Swedish pharmaceuticals group may discover again on Friday when
it presents its 1993 figures. The group's record speaks for itself: for 15
consecutive years up to 1992 profits growth outstripped sales and the feat
will almost certainly have been repeated last year.
Analysts' expectations range widely, but the average forecast is for pre-tax
profits of SKr7.7bn - SKr7.8bn (Pounds 655m), up around 50 per cent on
1992's SKr5.12bn. The 1992 dividend of SKr1 per share (adjusted for a share
split) is expected to be raised to at least SKr1.5.
The wide range of forecasts stems from uncertainty over the fourth quarter
performance after sizzling profits growth in the first nine months.
The key to the group's success has been the spectacular growth of two drugs:
Losec, an anti-peptic ulcer drug, and Pulmicort, an anti-asthma agent. But
like other pharmaceuticals groups worldwide, the company has had less
success in raising prices because of government clampdowns on healthcare
spending.
Investors will therefore be looking for a positive statement about
prospects. Again, expectations are running high: Kleinwort Benson, for
example, is already penciling in profits of SKr9.8bn for the current year.

FT  21 FEB 94 / CW to raim at Asia-Pacific region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, intends to make the
Asia-Pacific region its prime investment focus for the next decade.
Mr James Ross, CW's chief executive, told the FT that a strategy review had
made telecoms growth opportunities in the Asia-Pacific the company's chief
priority.
He said the 'medium-term objective' was to devote the free cash flow of Hong
Kong Telecom, which is 57.5 per cent owned by CW, to investment in the
Asia-Pacific region, allowing for a 'proper dividend' to the group.
That implies a large concentration of investment in the Asia-Pacific region,
since HK Telecom last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of CW's Pounds
829m operating profit, although the Asia-Pacific region accounted for only
44 per cent of CW's turnover.
He added that CW did not attach 'high priority' to the rush to
international telecoms alliances led by British Telecommunications and
American Telephone  Telegraph.
'CW is a federation in its own right, and we don't need others just to give
us a global capacity,' he said.
In Europe, Mr Ross affirmed CW's determination to pursue opportunities as
the European Union liberalises telecommunications services.

FT  21 FEB 94 / BMW talks to Honda on Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW is expected to start learning in Tokyo today Honda's response to the
German carmaker's Pounds 800m plan to buy Rover Group, Honda's UK partner.
Talks this week involving Honda executives and teams led by Mr Bernd
Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, and Mr John Towers, chief executive of
Rover, will help determine whether Honda will continue under BMW's majority
ownership its 15-year partnership with Rover.
Last night Honda, which has a 20 per cent stake in Rover, was giving no
clues as to which way it might jump. Its agreements with Rover allow it to
break formal ties as little as seven days after the passing of Rover into
new ownership.
However, analysts this weekend said such a move would be almost
inconceivable given the commercial value to Honda of its collaboration with
Rover. Honda receives some Pounds 400m annually in parts revenue alone, for
example.
The Japanese carmaker has made clear its anger at the intended deal, which
it regards as a betrayal of the close working relationship which has
developed between Honda and Rover.
But this anger is directed solely at Rover's current owner, British
Aerospace. Honda executives say that Rover itself has been powerless to
prevent its own sale.
BMW hopes to persuade Honda to stay in the partnership. However, Honda
regards BMW as a rival, strongly wished for Rover to remain independent, and
at the least is expected to extract a high commercial price for not pulling
out.
Should Honda be persuaded to form a long-term, tripartite collaboration, 'it
would be a seminal event which could change the status of the motor industry
for ever', and guarantee the futures of all three, according to Professor
Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School
and adviser to the House of Commons select committee on trade and industry.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Swiss vote to banish transit lorries from the Alps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Swiss moved boldly yesterday to protect their alpine environment, voting
in a plebiscite to ban all transit lorry traffic through the Swiss Alps
within 10 years even though such a ban is likely to worsen relations between
their government and the European Union.
Nearly 52 per cent of those who went to the polls voted in support of the
ban, defying the Swiss government's strong denunciation of the proposal. Two
years ago, Bern signed a 12-year accord with the EU to restrain the growth
of transit lorry traffic in the Alps. It argued in the referendum campaign
that this provided adequate protection, but will no longer be able to
respect that agreement.
It is the second time in less than two years that the Swiss people have
voted to undo agreements between their government and the EU. In December
1992 they rejected proposals to join the European Economic Area, a free
trade zone linking the countries of the European Free Trade Association with
the EU.
In Brussels, an EU official said the decision was regrettable. Bern fears
that the EU will be reluctant to enter planned bilateral negotiations over
air traffic rights in the union for Swissair and other issues.
There was jubilation in the tiny canton of Uri, which lies in a narrow
mountain valley leading up to the Gotthard Pass, the shortest road and rail
route between Germany and Italy. It was there that a petition was drawn up
in 1990 proposing that all transit lorry traffic be forced to move to the
railways after a 10-year transition period and all Swiss transit-related
motorway construction be halted.
About 2,500 lorries go through the Gotthard Pass each day, of which 1,000
are in transit. Much of this is EU traffic.
A crestfallen Mr Adolf Ogi, the Swiss transport minister, said the
government would do what it could to minimise discrimination against EU
lorries, but there is little room for manoeuvre. Under Switzerland's system
of direct democracy, the people's decision in a plebiscite is binding.
The result could also complicate the EU's enlargement negotiations with
Austria, now in an intense final phase. Austrians are also upset about the
pollution caused in Alpine valleys by transit lorries. Their determination
to prevent any further liberalisation of transit traffic could be stiffened
by the Swiss vote.
Mr Viktor Klima, Austria's transport minister, noted in Brussels yesterday
that the vote was a signal that Europeans wanted a more environmentally
friendly transport policy.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Rise in legal claims hits top accountancy firms: Auditors
say they are turning away high-risk clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's six largest accountancy firms faced about 600 legal claims last
year and paid up to 8 per cent of their audit income on costs related to
legal actions.
The number of claims has risen sharply in recent years, following growing
litigation against auditors in the US, much of it considered by the
profession to be unjustified.
The figures were compiled for two studies as part of a campaign to reform
the law of unlimited liability on auditors and will be submitted to the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The growing size and number of claims makes commercial insurance cover much
more difficult to obtain. Accountancy firms say they have started to turn
away high-risk clients, and begun negotiating limits on their legal
liability for non-audit work.
A working group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales tackling litigation claims says the average claims in the largest
three lawsuits last year were nearly Pounds 500m, compared with Pounds 40m
10 years ago. The figures exclude exceptional claims for more than Dollars
8bn relating to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The largest claims are several times the average limits on commercial
insurance cover, currently about Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m). Payments higher
than those limits are covered from insurance mutuals and the firms' own
resources.
The working group's paper is to be discussed by the institute's council on
March 2 as part of an effort to win support across the profession for a
campaign by the eight largest accountancy firms.
Separate information compiled by the firms' insurers showing the proportion
of audit income spent on litigation-related costs has been produced at the
request of government officials.
The accountancy firms want section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act removed.
This forbids auditors to negotiate for a cap on their liabilities in the
event that they are sued.
Some observers have criticised the campaign for its self-interest, and
accused the profession of selecting favourable or incomplete data. For
example, the fee income figures to which litigation costs are compared do
not take into account revenues from non-audit income, such as consultancy
work which may have been generated by the audit.
The information on which the calculations are based is also not publicly
available. The firms refuse to publish any of their own financial
information.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Taiwan and Boeing in talks on joint regional jet project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan Aerospace is in talks with Boeing over possible joint development of
a 100-seat regional jet.
The move follows the failure of talks last year between the aerospace
company, which is 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, and British
Aerospace to co-operate on a similar project.
The proposed collaboration with Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of
commercial aircraft, could also involve co-operation with the Chinese
aircraft industry as well as Japan.
The talks are the third attempt by Taiwan Aerospace, created three years ago
to spearhead the country's ambitions to develop an aerospace industry, to
forge an international partnership. The first proposed link was with
McDonnell Douglas of the US.
Mr Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said yesterday the
US company was discussing the possibility of developing either a 100-seat
aircraft or a small derivative of its 737 twin-engine airliner with Taiwan,
China and possibly Japan. Mr Albrecht, attending a Financial Times aerospace
conference on the eve of the Singapore Air Show, also confirmed that Boeing
was conducting separate studies with the three Japanese aerospace companies
(Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy
Industries) on development of a 100-seat airliner.
It was too early to say whether the Japanese companies, already
long-standing partners on other Boeing programmes, would participate on a
broader collaboration project with Taiwan and China. But Boeing is stepping
up efforts to put into place a longer term strategy to increase its
penetration of a fast growing Chinese aviation market.
Mr Albrecht said he would soon visit Taiwan to discuss collaboration.
Taiwan had attempted for the past year to forge a joint regional jet venture
with BAe. But the two sides failed to reach agreement and negotiations were
suspended three months ago. Even more ambitious partnership discussions
between Taiwan Aerospace and McDonnell Douglas collapsed in 1992.
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing received a boost last week with the
announcement of an intended Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) commercial aircraft
order from Saudi Arabia. The two US manufacturers are to send delegations to
Saudi Arabia on March 20 to start negotiating details of the contract to
supply about 50 aircraft to Saudia, the national airline.
Mr Albrecht said Saudi Arabia had also asked the US manufacturers to propose
a substantial aircraft support and maintenance package which could involve
'several hundred million of dollars more'. He confirmed that the Saudis had
not yet decided what aircraft types they intended to purchase.
Although Rolls-Royce, the UK aero engine manufacturer, supplied the power
plants for Saudia's existing fleet of 747s, the latest order is likely to
involve US-made engines because of the strong political impetus behind the
Saudi deal, according to European aerospace officials.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a good year for index-linked gilts so far. Having finished
1993 around 2.85 per cent, real yields are now back over 3 per cent. In
theory, index-linked paper ought to provide a haven for worried equity
investors. The two instruments have a similar structure, in that capital
value and annual payout on equities tend to increase with inflation too. But
equities carry an additional company risk and, at only around 0.25 per cent,
the difference between the FT-A All - Share dividend yield and real yields
on index-linked gilts is the lowest for almost two years. That should make
index-linked attractive, but it probably says more about the degree to which
equities are over-valued.
Part of the trouble is the perennial lack of liquidity in the index-linked
market. But inflationary and exchange rate worries have not subsided enough
to allow real yields on conventional bonds to fall much below 3 per cent.
Since real yields on index-linked issues tend to follow those on
conventional gilts, the chance of further progress is limited for
index-linked as well.
Indeed, the low coupons on index-linked gilts produce a gearing effect which
means their prices fall more sharply than those of conventional gilts when
real yields are rising. That reduces their safe-haven attraction. In
contrast, index-linked will outperform conventional issues when higher
inflation rather than upward pressure on real yields is causing fixed-rate
prices to fall. Last week's retail and producer price figures suggest that
point is still some way off.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Swiss banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 36 per cent increase in Swiss Bank Corporation's latest annual net
profit bodes well for other Swiss banks due to report soon. Though part of
the increase was due to an apparent drop in the tax charge, there is little
doubt that the bank has made a killing on derivative trading. And while the
44 per cent increase in provisions and other charges in part reflects
payments to the former owners of its O'Connor derivatives partnership, the
bank seems to have felt inclined to smooth its earnings jump with a high
provisions charge. Other banks, including UBS which reports on Friday,
should also enjoy a substantial increase in profits from derivatives
trading, but Swiss Bank may feel the benefit more strongly in its share
price. CS Holding needs the additional income to limit earnings dilution as
it builds up its relatively low capital base. UBS weathered the recession
better than SBC, which was caught not only by bad domestic loans but also by
large losses on overseas lending. At the end of 1992, UBS's provisions were
0.43 per cent of total assets. At 0.65 per cent those of Swiss Bank had
further to fall.
The large additional provisions made for 1993 together with restructuring
efforts by its new management means Swiss Bank is better shielded from any
fall in trading income this year. The chances are that its earnings growth
will outstrip that of UBS. Its bearer shares, which under-performed its
larger rival's by about 3 per cent over the past year, will then also start
to pull ahead.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cardiff is rarely mentioned in the same breath as Hollywood, but last week
both towns were offered a glimpse of the multimedia future. The trouble is
that no one knows if it will work. Viacom, which conquered Paramount with a
Dollars 9.7bn bid, now has to prove that its industrial vision makes
financial sense. By contrast, TCI's decision to take a 20 per cent stake in
the Welsh ITV contractor, HTV, involves an outlay of just Pounds 27m. The
deal may come to be seen as marking a symbolic shift in power from Channel 3
to cable and satellite television. Similar deals are almost certain to
follow, which makes Granada's tilt at LWT appear almost parochial.
HTV argues that advertising growth prospects for Channel 3 franchises will
be limited by the proliferation of rival television networks. Alternative
revenue streams are therefore essential. The link-up with a cable operator,
such as TCI, gives it an effective way of recycling its existing programmes
and an alternative channel for new productions. Cable television operators
foresee all kinds of possibilities for broadening their services, with
telephony and interactive home shopping just the start. In such a thrilling
world, it seems almost impertinent to observe that few cable operators have
yet made money. Some critics argue that they never will. The delivery of
television programmes may simply become a commodity service.
Television may follow the trend in computers, where power has slipped from
the hardware to software suppliers. The value attached to programme makers
is likely to grow significantly with the demand for programming hours
forecast to triple by the end of the decade.

FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rewarding Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil has worked hard for more than five years to bring its Nelson
field on stream. Given that, it must be galling that the oil started to flow
this weekend with crude prices around their lowest for eight years, and at
their lowest in real terms for 20. The rate of output from the company's
Scott and Nelson fields means that by 1995-96, Enterprise's oil output will
be almost double that in 1990-91. That success has won the company a share
price which stands at a premium to net assets. Measured after tax payments
but before dividends, cash will flood into the company at around Pounds 400m
a year. Yet low oil prices cut into potential profits, and earnings will not
look anything like as rosy as cash flow. The company's dividend payment may
remain barely covered.
On top of that, Enterprise must find or buy oil on the same scale as its
newly-expanded production capacity if it is not to mine into its asset base
and reduce its longer-term value. Finding reserves at the rate they are
being used will soak up almost all of that Pounds 400m a year of free cash
flow about to be produced.
There is thus an argument that the dividend should be cut, because it is
sucking too much cash out of the business. That would be a poor reward for
Enterprise's loyal shareholders. But if oil prices remain low, and
exploration remains fundamentally unprofitable, much of that money may not
be worth spending. It might then be returned to shareholders or invested
outside the upstream oil business. Weighing that decision will be the acid
test of Mr Graham Hearne's chairmanship.

Always thought that Eurotunnel chairman Sir Alastair Morton was a bit of a
loose cannon. No sooner has the government given him the chairmanship of its
Private Finance Working group, than up he pops telling the other side how to
do it.
Morton, who stepped down as chief executive of Eurotunnel last month, has
been given star billing in Labour's press release on its new public/private
sector partnership. Morton, headed the state-owned British National Oil
Corporation the last time Labour was in power, but promises that he's not
contributing to the opposition's new initiative. He has only agreed to speak
at its conference on February 24 in order to get his views across to a wider
audience. He's doing the same for the Tory's Bow Group in March.
Even so, Morton's political dexterity is bound to increase the sense in some
government quarters that the sooner he gets given a proper job to do again,
the better. Then, perhaps, the chairmanship of the Treasury working group
can be turned over to a more government-friendly type like former BP
chairman Bob Horton, now running Railtrack.

David Mellor, the former Tory Cabinet minister, is learning fast. He's been
taken on as a senior adviser to accountants Ernst  Young, adding to his
increasingly fat portfolio of business consultancies.
Mellor's policy of concentrating on advisory jobs, rather than company
directorships, makes a lot of sense. Not only do most consultancy jobs pay
far better than the average non-executive director's fee, but they involve
none of the legal responsibilities of being a company director. David Howell
(ex-Queens Moat Houses) and Sir Charles Powell (ex-Tiphook), are just a few
of the political insiders who have sat on boards of companies that have run
into trouble. It doesn't look good on their CVs.
It is much more rewarding to be employed as an adviser to a company, and
much easier to disappear into the shadows if there is a hint of corporate
trouble. The habit's bound to catch on.

Spare a thought for Sir Peter Harding, the marshal of the RAF and chief of
defence staff. As if he did not have enough on his plate advising the
Cabinet about sending troops to Bosnia, he also has to find cuts of Pounds
1bn a year in the Ministry of Defence's budget.
His pinstriped troops have been forced to review everything from procurement
costs down to the things that the military really care about, such as
military bands, animals, and uniformed vets.
However, Observer can report that one vital defence cut has been restored.
When Air Chief Marshall Sir 'Sandy' Wilson takes over the RAF's new admin
headquarters at Innsworth he'll find that the number of VIP toilets under
his command is back to full strength.
The MoD has shot down a report that a proposed library in the officers' mess
at RAF Innsworth had been scrapped in favour of a powder room for the new
commander's wife. The MoD admitted that the plans had been 'amended' to
increase the number of VIP privies from one to two, but said that all its
commands have two VIP toilets.
There was also no question of the officers going without their reading
matter for the convenience of the commander's wife. The new mess would still
have a library. That's a relief.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Selling the railways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of British Rail is moving into the implementation stage.
After the furore in parliament over the legislation, the government's
ambitious plans to privatise the railways are now being put into effect. A
new industrial sector must be created and financed to operate the privatised
rail network.
The privatisation of passenger rail services as 24 rail operating companies
will present early opportunities for private sector involvement. The first
route to be put out to tender, the Gatwick Express between London and
Gatwick airport, is already running as a shadow franchise under the existing
management. Later this year, the franchise for running the line will be put
out to tender.
Several more shadow franchises will be established in April, in preparation
for tendering early next year. On most routes, the managers will be
encouraged to lead management buyouts. At the same time as passenger
services are privatised, other parts of British Rail will be prepared for
sale.
These include freight operations and the three leasing companies that will
lease rolling stock to the operating companies. BR's maintenance operations
are to be privatised as more than a dozen competing companies. And
Railtrack, the organisation created to run the rail infrastructure, will
take over responsibility for the network from April.
The success of rail privatisation, however, will be judged by the benefits
it brings for passengers. Ensuring that the customer sees real improvements
in services requires the emergence of competitive and entrepreneurial rail
operators. Businesses thinking about entering this new market - or providing
finance for it - will need to be convinced that there are profitable
opportunities.
Charges
There must be grounds for concern, therefore, over the charges that
operators will have to pay for using the railway network. The charges will
rightly reflect the operating costs of Railtrack on the routes covered by
each franchise. These include track maintenance, signalling costs, depot
charges and the cost of electricity. Amazingly, some of these were not
allocated to particular lines under BR's internal accounting system. But the
charges also reflect a Treasury target that Railtrack should make a 5.6 per
cent return on its assets, valued at around Pounds 6.5bn. The rate of return
will rise to 8 per cent within four years.
Tight target
This target is excessively tight. An 8 per cent rate of return is
unnecessarily steep for what is essentially a utility. As for the value put
on the assets, it can plausibly be argued that it should be much higher than
Pounds 6.5bn, since BR still owns a lot of land in inner-city sites.
Alternatively, it might be set much lower given the age of much of the
track, signalling and stations and their run-down state.
What is clear is that applying such a high rate of return to this asset
value will add around Pounds 500m to the charges that rail operators must
pay. Bumping up charges in this way could lead to the rail network being
used inefficiently at much less than capacity. It will also mean that fewer
of the franchises will be profitable without public subsidy. This creates a
merry-go-round in which the revenue extracted by the Treasury from Railtrack
must be paid out in subsidies to rail operators to pay higher-than-necessary
track charges.
The aim of these arrangements is to concentrate public subsidy for passenger
services on one part of the system - the rail operators. The operator can,
of course, still make a profit while receiving a subsidy, by maximising
revenues and efficiency.
However, businesses thinking about entering this new market may find the
prospect of relying on Treasury subsidies for the duration of a franchise
less than appetising. This will be especially the case if the government
agrees to franchise periods as long as 15 years to encourage operators to
invest in new rolling stock.
The arrangements for setting Railtrack's charges are likely to reduce the
attractiveness of investment opportunities in rail operations. Given the
need to attract businesses into this new sector, this cannot be an outcome
that is welcome to supporters of privatisation.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Leading Article: End-game on enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today in Brussels, negotiations on admitting four new members to the
European Union enter what should be their final lap. Foreign ministers from
the 12 existing members and the four would-be entrants - Sweden, Norway,
Finland and Austria - have every incentive to make this round conclusive. If
the talks do not show decisive progress in the next week, it will be
difficult, if not impossible, for the four applicants to hold their planned
ratification referendums and join by the target date of January 1995. As
important, the whole enlargement process may lose momentum. The result would
be further damage to the EU's battered effectiveness and self-esteem - and
further delay on the equally pressing question of bringing in the nascent
market economies of central Europe.
Fortunately, the hopes for a breakthrough are now better than at any time
since the negotiations were seriously joined last year. Public opinion is
moving in favour of entry even in the most sceptical candidate country,
Norway. Opposition among the Nordic states to the EU's terms on the
stickiest problems still to be resolved - agriculture and the budget -
appears to be softening, assisted by figures from the European Commission
indicating that their net contributions to the Union budget will be even
more modest than previously thought.
It is too soon to celebrate, however. The EU's bargaining position could yet
be thrown into confusion by additional budgetary demands from the poorer
southern states, led by Spain.
The issues of how to align the applicant countries' farm protection regimes
with the Common Agricultural Policy, and how to compensate farmers who stand
to lose in the process, still present obstacles that will only be surmounted
with creative thinking from both sides.
Volatile electorates
The challenge is to produce enlargement agreements attractive enough to
secure acceptance by the volatile electorates of the four applicants,
without destabilising the delicate web of budgetary and other agreements
between the existing 12. Even on agriculture, where Finland, Austria and
Norway currently guarantee their farmers prices 25 to 100 per cent higher
than under the CAP, that should not be beyond the negotiators.
The EU's proposal, for a 'big bang' realignment of prices, compensated
through direct payments to farmers threatened with reduced incomes, is
sensible. The alternative - a phased transition, during which price
differences would be ironed out with border levies - would generate
prolonged uncertainty, interfere with the single market, and further
complicate the still problematic task of CAP reform. What is more, the EU
proposal offers applicant governments powerful ammunition with which to sell
an agreement to their voters, in the form of sharply lower food prices for
consumers.
Frozen north
Their core problem is how to deal with their seriously disadvantaged farmers
 -those who toil in the frozen north and on Alpine pastures. Understandably
perhaps, the candidate countries are balking at the EU's suggestion that
they fund compensation payments themselves: they want assistance in doing so
from the Union, as well as generous treatment for their poorer areas under
EU regional funds. This is where the haggling will focus over the next few
days, with Spain and its southern allies pushing a hard line on the regional
funds and other EU governments withholding budgetary concessions until the
last possible moment.
While most of Spain's demands can be dismissed as predictable special
pleading, the EU as a whole is wise to adopt a hard-nosed approach on the
budget. The countries seeking membership are all at the upper end of the
EU's income scale and, if they choose for cultural, environmental or other
reasons to subsidise agriculture in regions where it is manifestly
unprofitable, they should contribute towards those subsidies from their
national exchequers, subject to EU control. Equally, it is strongly in the
EU's interests to bring these negotiations to a brisk conclusion. If the
price of doing so turns out to involve a modest top-up for such national
assistance, that should not be an insuperable obstacle to reaching a final
agreement.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Super-highways sans frontieres: European Union plans for
pan-continental networks to give the single market an infrastructure
backbone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the European Commission has a big idea these days, it is trans-European
networks. The bruising struggle to ratify the Maastricht treaty and the
near-collapse of the exchange rate mechanism last year may have knocked
monetary union off course. But across Brussels, dozens of Eurocrats are
beavering away at the next ambitious programme for European integration: a
plan to develop transport, energy and telecommunications networks spanning
the continent.
The initiative was launched with much fanfare last December by Commission
president Jacques Delors. His white paper on Europe's competitiveness listed
a large number of new railway, road, telecommunications, gas, electricity,
airport and port projects that would knit Europe's far-flung regions with
the core of the European Union, and provide an infrastructure backbone for
the single market. The networks would also extend beyond the Union into
European Free Trade Association countries and eastern Europe.
The programme's total cost is put at Ecu400bn (Pounds 300bn) by the end of
the century. Of this, Ecu220bn would be for transport projects, Ecu150bn for
telecommunications and Ecu30bn for energy.
Leaders at last December's Brussels summit gave the initiative a qualified
go-ahead. They approved the overall thrust, but not specific details - in
particular Commission plans for financing the programme.
Now the Commission's challenge is to refine its plans and win over the
doubters. A crucial role will be played by Mr Henning Christophersen, the
economics commissioner, who will today chair the second meeting of a
taskforce consisting of high-level officials from each member state. The
group will hear new Commission ideas on how the initiative could be
financed. It will also discuss which transport and energy projects should
receive priority.
A parallel taskforce, consisting of telecommunications users, operators and
manufacturers, is being chaired by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry
commissioner. It will look at how an advanced telecommunications
infrastructure - which would be needed if, say, 'teleworking' from home was
to become much more common - can be developed. The Commission is anxious
that Europe does not fall behind the US, where the Clinton administration is
trying to encourage the construction of such 'information superhighways'.
Meanwhile, officials from more than half a dozen Commission directorates are
working on detailed aspects of the trans-European networks initiative. Both
the Christophersen and Bangemann groups will present progress reports to the
next European summit in Corfu in June.
The reason the initiative was launched was belief in Brussels that European
businesses and consumers are disadvantaged because networks have developed
on national rather than transnational lines. 'Networks were designed to
satisfy the European nation states of the 19th century,' says Mr
Christophersen.
There are many examples of what Commission officials see as anomalies:
cross-border phone calls cost three times as much as domestic calls of a
similar distance; air travellers can face long delays because poorly
co-ordinated national air traffic control systems cannot handle as many
flights as a single unified system; Italian lorries thunder through the
Rhine Valley on their way to Rotterdam because Italy's ports are not modern
enough; and there are as yet no high-speed rail links between national
capitals.
Enthusiasm in Brussels is one thing; winning the necessary support - and
finance - from member states is quite another. The general idea that
fragmented networks damage Europe's competitiveness has widespread
acceptance. That was why an article was written into the Maastricht treaty
giving the Commission authority to draw up proposals for trans-European
networks and promote their development.
But there is still much debate about three big questions. Are all the
projects identified by the Commission really necessary? Will the Union need
to subsidise the networks or can investment be left to member states and
private companies? Will the networks develop faster and more efficiently if
traditional national monopolies in telecommunications, energy and transport
are abolished?
Doubts over the list of projects stem largely from the way they have been
chosen. The Commission asked member states to propose candidates and then
collated the suggestions into master plans. But because favoured projects
may qualify for EU subsidies, each government had an incentive to get as
many of its national projects as possible included.
The initiative is viewed in some quarters as the next European gravy train.
'It is about money,' admits a transport official in one member state.
This explains why the programme's cost has reached a staggering Ecu400bn. It
also explains why the list includes projects which appear to be of mainly
national, rather than pan-European, benefit. For example, the master plan
for trans-European roads - consisting of 55,000km of roads, 12,000km of them
motorways - is largely an amalgamation of existing national road plans.
Officials argue that, even when infrastructure is confined to a single
member state, it may be of broader European interest for two reasons:
Spill-over effects. For example, Ireland has an interest in motorways being
built across England and Wales so its traffic can have easy access to the
Channel tunnel. Equally, a planned railway from Rotterdam to the border with
Germany will be more profitable if Germany continues the line into its
industrial Ruhr region.
Incompatible standards. For example, trains travelling from Sweden to
Denmark have to switch to a different electricity system. Similarly, many
advanced telecommunications services such as electronic mail systems do not
interconnect smoothly across borders.
The Commission believes it can play a useful role in co-ordinating
investment plans across frontiers. One way of achieving this could be for
the Commission to hold roundtable discussions for particular projects to
identify what is stopping them moving ahead. The Commission would then knock
heads together to remove the blockages.
A prime candidate would be air-traffic control, says Mr Robert Coleman, head
of the Commission's transport directorate. National air-traffic controllers
have been discussing harmonising their systems for years without much
progress. The new powers in the Maastricht treaty would allow aviation
ministers to vote on a common approach and then make it stick.
Mr Christophersen admits that not every project in the overall programme is
equally important. But he says the Commission has already made a preliminary
selection of priority projects which cost only Ecu160bn. His taskforce will
further refine priorities.
Examples of the priority projects include: high-speed rail links between
London, Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam at a total cost of Ecu8.5bn;
a motorway from Berlin to Moscow via Warsaw costing Ecu3.2bn; and a new
Athens airport costing Ecu2bn.
Even if agreement is reached on priorities, the financing of the new
networks will remain controversial. In his white paper, Mr Delors argued
that the Union would need to provide Ecu20bn a year in subsidies and loans.
Of this, Ecu5bn would come from the Union's cohesion and structural funds.
These channel aid to Europe's poorest regions and countries: in particular,
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. This money has already been earmarked
in the Union's budget.
A further Ecu7bn, Mr Delors suggested, could be raised by loans from the
European Investment Bank. The final Ecu8bn would be raised on the financial
markets by the Commission and then lent to governments or private companies.
This last proposal, for what were dubbed 'Union Bonds', caused particular
controversy at the Brussels summit. Germany and the UK criticised it on the
grounds that borrowing by the Commission would offer governments a back-door
route to avoiding public expenditure disciplines.
The critics were also concerned that the Commission's AAA credit rating in
financial markets might be damaged if it made large loans to countries with
poorer credit ratings, such as Greece and Italy. They said that, if more
money for infrastructure investment was needed, it should come from the EIB
which has a track record in project finance.
These objections have caused the Commission to beat a tactical retreat. Mr
Christophersen says Union Bonds are just one of several financial
instruments that could boost infrastructure investment.
Mr Enrico Cioffi, head of the Commission's investment directorate, suggests
other possibilities:
Bonds, issued by the Commission but linked to particular road, rail, air or
maritime traffic projects. Coupons paid to investors might depend on the
volume of traffic the project attracts. Loan guarantees by the Commission.
These could be used for those parts of a network located outside the Union
such as motorways or telecommunications lines extending into eastern Europe.
Although the Commission is no longer pushing Union Bonds as the main option,
the thinking behind the other ideas remains the same: the Commission could
use its AAA status to cut borrowing costs for countries with lower credit
ratings. The benefit for states such as Greece, Italy, Ireland and Denmark
could be the equivalent of between half and one percentage point off
interest rates, says Mr Cioffi. But such proposals could run into the same
opposition from member states as Union Bonds.
Part of the Ecu20bn envisaged by Mr Delors could be provided as direct
subsidies to projects, though the Commission has yet to spell out how this
might work. Subsidies would not necessarily be limited to regions that
already qualify for structural and cohesion funds.
Some member states, however, are worried that such handouts could be a waste
of public money. They could merely lead to the construction of grandiose
projects with little economic benefit.
Whatever is decided on Union funding, there is a consensus that national
budgets are so strapped that the bulk of the money for trans-European
networks will have to come from the private sector. This raises the question
of whether a bigger push is needed to privatise and liberalise monopoly
sectors.
There are sharp differences between member states over liberalisation. The
UK has traditionally led the free-market group, while France has supported
the continuation of public-sector monopolies.
Within the Commission, there are similar, though less sharp, differences.
Most officials agree that liberalisation would help the trans-European
network initiative, but they differ over whether the Commission needs to do
more than it is already doing.
The liberal camp believes that national monopolies in transport,
telecommunications and energy are the root cause of fragmented networks.
Public-sector monopolies have little incentive to look beyond their national
frontiers, while their monopoly status has prevented private operators
building transnational links instead.
Those who hold this view point to the US, where transcontinental networks
and competitive markets go hand in hand. In particular, they say a lesson is
to be learnt from the Clinton administration which is seeking to develop US
information superhighways by liberalising the telecommunications and cable
television industries, rather than pumping in government money.
Abolishing monopolies would allow private investment to flow into
infrastructure projects. Priorities would be chosen on economic criteria as
companies sought out the most profitable opportunities. There would also be
less need to co-ordinate investment as operators would be free to range
across boundaries.
'The big issue is lifting the restrictions. That is the only way of
mobilising the investment,' says Mr Herbert Ungerer, who runs the
Commission's telecommunications policy unit.
But others say that liberalisation is not the complete story. For a start,
it is harder to apply the approach in loss-making sectors such as railways
and roads than in profitable sectors such as telecommunications and energy.
Moreover, even in a liberalised market there would be a need for
co-ordinated investment and harmonised standards.
Such issues will have to be addressed by EU member states in the next few
months, if the foundations of trans-European networks are to be laid before
the end of the century. With the future of European competitiveness at
stake, there is already some impetus behind the plans. But if the
trans-European network initiative is really to gather momentum, members will
have to overcome any qualms they may have about a fresh commitment to
working together on a pan-continental scale.

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Barry Riley's article, 'Yielding no quarter'
(February 12-13), which discussed the problems in managing the risks
inherent in meeting the demand for fixed rate mortgages from a floating rate
funding base. I was surprised that no mention was made of the modern risk
management techniques available to mitigate and control such risks, in
particular derivatives. This omission is all the more surprising since
building societies are already extensive users of such instruments.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: BAe set the standard for winning
defence contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MAURICE C S DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'BAe shareholders weigh up old guard's power' (February
14), is not alone in dwelling on the need 'to wean' the 'operating chiefs'
of the British Aerospace defence business 'from their old cost plus ways'.
As one who held senior positions for a number of years in that business may
I set the record straight.
It was the former Hawker Siddeley Aviation and British Aircraft Corporation
that were combined through nationalisation in the late 1970s to form British
Aerospace. In the early 1970s Hawker Siddeley management had launched the
Hawk fighter trainer aircraft having won the project through competitive
tender run by the Ministry of Defence. The Hawk contract was fixed price,
covering both the development of the aircraft and the supply of the first
production batches. Meanwhile, the management of BAC had entered the
Anglo-French Jaguar and tri-national Tornado collaborative aircraft
programmes at a time when collaboration was both unproven and considered in
certain circles to be doomed to failure.
Those policies and programmes predated British Aerospace but laid the
foundations for the successes of the company throughout the 1980s and up to
the present day. The defence management team not only delivered these
products to our Royal Air Force but leveraged off of the programmes to win a
series of highly successful export orders, none of which was cost plus. The
UK defence equipment industry, including GEC Marconi, would not be in the
position it is today had the British Aerospace defence team not won those
orders.
Whatever the causes of BAe's problems of recent years, management of its
defence business is not one of them. The management team has comparable, if
not more, experience in successful management of substantial fixed price
contracts than any other major UK company.

   From M J FEINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to John Major's exhortation to the best brains to enter
industry ('PM asks top brains to enter industry', February 12-13), can
anyone really advocate having a working life of only 25 years? Assuming the
best brains are graduates, they will not enter industry until they are 21.
Judging by the job advertisements, and current recruiting practices, they
will not be employable after the age of 45. Effectively they have to earn
enough in 25 years to keep themselves for the next 30 years. Is that really
an attractive proposition? Until industry changes its ageist attitude, it
does not deserve to have the best brains.

FT  21 FEB 94 / A Prussian in the White House: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton faces a vexing decision. Should he and his general staff (the
White House National Economic Council) wear army fatigues? Or would it make
more sense to wear tracksuits emblazoned 'Team USA'?
Frankly, I don't think it matters a great deal. For trade wars with Japan, I
would recommend army uniforms with lashings of gold braid. I would give
Robert Rubin, the NEC director, a military rank and award campaign medals to
staff who devise particularly ingenious trade sanctions.
I would reserve the Team USA tracksuits for more routine tasks, such as
presidential lobbying on behalf of corporate America. Last week, Mr Clinton
described the Dollars 6bn aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia as a 'gold medal
win for America's businesses and workers'. He was too modest. Having
bombarded King Fahd with letters and phone calls - and having sent secretary
of state Warren Christopher to Riyadh to plead for business - Mr Clinton
deserves the medal himself.
The US is in its third year of a robust economic recovery. Business
investment and productivity are soaring. The US share of foreign markets is
up sharply. The budget and trade deficits are much reduced. Unemployment has
fallen sharply, to well below 7 per cent. Europe and Japan, by contrast, are
floundering in recession. In the circumstances, you might expect the White
House to feel relaxed, even magnanimous.
Instead, Mr Clinton and his senior advisers are behaving like economic
delinquents. In December, Mr Clinton hailed the merits of the Uruguay Round,
which promises to deregulate agriculture and financial services, sectors in
which the US is highly competitive. As a 'new democrat' he was all for
multilateral trade liberalisation under the Gatt.
Yet a mere two months later, he solemnly chastises Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
Japan's reform-minded prime minister, for refusing to accept numerical
targets for import growth in selected industrial sectors. Such targets -
essentially a government commitment to reserve a portion of Japan's home
market for US and foreign companies - are the very antithesis of the Gatt
principles that Mr Clinton was promoting so hard last year. Perhaps Mr
Clinton is genuinely incapable of understanding the contradiction. If so, it
is lamentable that economically literate senior aides - including Larry
Summers at the Treasury - are so eager to play this charade.
US officials, of course, sometimes claim they are not demanding numerical
targets. All they want are quantitative benchmarks to judge progress in
opening Japanese markets. This is spurious talk of medal-winning dimensions.
It is not as though Japanese trade figures are a state secret: quantitative
measures of progress in opening specific markets have always been readily
available.
In any case, as a member of a multilateral system, the US simply has no
right to act as judge and jury on Japanese trade practices. To put US
behaviour in perspective, suppose France analysed US wine consumption and
found an unfair bias in favour of inferior Californian brands. Would Mr
Clinton be happy if President Mitterrand unilaterally set a numerical target
for increased US imports of French Burgundy? Of course not: he would
instantly condemn such bully-boy tactics.
The obsession with the Japanese bilateral imbalance is even more fatuous.
White House talk of impenetrable barriers creates the false impression that
Japan buys virtually nothing from the US. In reality, US exports to Japan
were Dollars 48bn last year, making it America's second most important
market. The bilateral deficit with Japan is declining relative to US
national income. But even if it were rising, it would signify nothing.
Surely Mr Clinton's high-powered economic advisers have not forgotten the
very first lesson of economics: that trade is beneficial because it
facilitates specialisation and division of labour. The last thing we should
expect or want is balanced trade between every pair of countries.
The almost gloating way in which Mr Clinton (with Mr Christopher dutifully
in attendance) announced his trade deal with King Fahd is particularly
disturbing. Nobody can deny that political leaders in other countries have
sought economic favours. But in past years, transgressions by smaller
countries were comparatively unimportant because US commitment to market
principles guaranteed the survival of a liberal global trading order. When
the boundaries between government and business begin to blur in the world's
biggest economy, the outlook is indeed grim. European and Japanese leaders
are certain to respond by redoubling their efforts on behalf of their
national champions.
For 200 years two quite distinct capitalist philosophies have vied for
supremacy. The first is the English concept (not always respected by British
governments) of genuinely liberal competition in which governments keep off
the pitch and companies compete solely on the basis on commercial merit. The
second is the corporatist state - first perfected by 19th century Prussia -
in which government acts as sponsor of domestic business in an 'economic
war' against other nations.
Sadly, Mr Clinton seems to be leaning in the Prussian direction. No true
market liberal would brag about winning contracts for businessmen, or set
unilateral targets for another nation's imports, or pour taxpayers' funds
into a domestic industrial policy. Yet Mr Clinton is doing all of this - and
with relish. He believes the US is in a race with Japan and the European
Union for economic supremacy in the 21st century, and he intends to take the
gold. We are again seeing the ugly face of economic nationalism.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Age structure not least of Irish
economic problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DAVID HITCHENS and Mr ESMOND BIRNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Garret Fitzgerald, (Personal View, February 15) in his consideration
of positive aspects of Ireland's economy, focuses on the age structure of
the population as the constraint on raising living standards, but Ireland
has a productivity/competitiveness problem as marked as this.
While low living standards in Ireland are largely a function of the small
proportion of the population in employment, this is only partly caused by
the greater proportion of young people in the Irish population. In 1992 just
over half of the Irish population of working age were in employment, but in
the UK the proportion was almost 70 per cent. There has been a long-run
failure to generate a sufficiently large industrial base and this failure is
a reflection of a lack of competitiveness.
In the aggregate statistics the unfavourable performance of domestically
owned firms is masked by the very rapid growth of the foreign-owned
manufacturing sector. Detailed study of Irish indigenous enterprises in
sectors such as farming, transport, energy, tourism and business services
indicates that productivity levels are substantially lower than those in the
UK. Irish products are frequently uncompetitive with respect to price or
non-price characteristics.
The increase in gross domestic product has indeed been rapid during
1988-1993 but it is usually accepted that GNP provides a better indicator of
the Irish population's material well-being because it makes allowance for
the burgeoning outflows of profit and interest payments (these outflows are
one consequence of the heavy reliance on international firms). GNP per
capita remains only two-thirds of the UK average.
Dr Fitzgerald considers the last five years, but when a longer time
perspective (eg, the last 30 or 70 years) has been considered it has usually
been concluded that the rate of 'catch up' on the levels of GDP per capita
in the UK or elsewhere is less than that which could be reasonably expected.
Past performance suggests there is more wrong with the Irish economy than
simply a delayed transition to low birth rates.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK's use of the democratic system
going wrong somewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D H BIESTERFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As is common to most of those who bemoan the Tories' 'steady, purposive
and highly effective destruction of local democracy', Joe Rogaly
('Dustbin-lids to the fore', February 15) omits to mention that local
democratic government is for most voters just as unaccountable as central
government. In that light the end result is much more important than the
route by which it is reached.
Hence the 'pretty picture' which Mr Rogaly suggests is conveyed by the
mandarins, of schools run by school boards and of hospitals run by hospital
trusts is far more than superficially appealing to the consumers involved.
In many historically Labour-controlled areas there is a justified feeling of
disenfranchisement among non-Labour voters. This feeling is now in danger of
taking root at national level among those who did not vote for the present
government.
Democracy, or our use of it, is going wrong somewhere, but whether this is
the failure of the system in a structural sense or results from the
inadequacy of politicians to present viable alternatives to their electorate
is open to debate.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Personal View: Tender loving care for better workers - The
company of the future will put more emphasis on looking after human assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES HANDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What will be the shape of tomorrow's companies? Almost certainly they will
look and feel very different from today. If they do not Britain's
competitiveness will surely sink. The 1993 world competitiveness survey by
the World Economic Forum put Britain 16th out of 22 countries, with
particularly low scores for innovation, science and technology, management
and people - precisely the assets needed in a constantly changing world and
when applied intelligence is the main source of future wealth.
For one thing, companies will be much smaller: ' 1/2 x 2 x 3' is becoming
the essential formula for those who want to remain competitive in an
interconnected world - half as many people, paid twice as well (because they
keep the best), producing three times as much added value. Then repeat the
exercise; it is possible - an estimated 65 per cent of most company's
activities do not add value. No longer are so many people needed to make
things happen. Those left become crucial human capital.
It will not, however, be easy to define or describe many companies. They
will be a web of alliances, joint projects, arrangements and pacts. More
risks will be shared. Companies will have centres but rather than head
offices they will be small centres designed on the principle of 'reverse
delegation' with the centre only doing what the parts on their own cannot do
and which they, therefore, delegate to the centre. Companies will be
federations of bits and pieces, joined together in different ways for
different purposes.
As a result, it will be increasingly difficult for shareholders to know what
they are buying into, or to what sort of risks they are exposed. It will be
all the more difficult because the real assets of the business, the
intellectual assets, will still be largely unquantifiable, unless
accountancy groups come up with new measures.
In the best businesses today the market value of the business is three or
four times the tangible assets and, in a good manufacturing company, labour
costs should not be more than 10 per cent of the product price. That leaves
lots of unmeasured space. Shareholders will be more careful about long-term
money and more likely to want some money today rather than possibly more
money later.
Contrary, therefore, to most prescriptions for better corporate governance,
we may see companies edging further away from shareholders in an attempt to
give more emphasis to the long-term future of the business. Directors may
see themselves as mainly accountable to their own people who have a real
incentive to build a better future. To put it another way, when human
capital becomes more important than financial capital, it will be the human
capital which calls the tunes. This may be a gradual change but it will be
profound.
In the end, the driving motive for most senior managers is to build a
sustainable enterprise. To achieve this and to recognise their new
accountability to human capital, companies will look for ways to turn key
people into quasi-partners. Some will hope to do that by more consultation.
But ultimately partnership means money, not talk. That is likely to entail
not share option schemes, which are a form of risk-free betting, but genuine
share ownership, perhaps with double voting rights as in some continental
companies, and with substantial shares in each year's added value. This will
not be primarily an incentive for employees, rather will it be an expression
of their membership rights.
Some companies may decide to venture further down this membership route,
limiting voting rights to large investors (owning more than 1 per cent,
perhaps) or to their own people. It will always be a cautious experiment,
however, for fear of alienating the wider market which will not want to see
its rights eroded too far. The formal aim of the company would still be as
it has always been: 'to add value'. But value would no longer be determined
solely by the price of the shares, but by other measures of the long-term
health of the business - measures which would be more relevant to the
membership than to temporary, smaller investors.
To continue to add ever more value, companies will have to be 'inclusive',
building long-term relationships with customers, suppliers and the
community. But all the main constituents would then pull in one direction -
the sustainable future of the business.
Tomorrow's companies will do all this because they will need to - not
because of some ideological pressure. If they do not treat central people as
partners and members, those people - whose talents provide the intellectual
assets of the business - will be free to treat the company as a
stepping-stone.
Without the bonds of membership, companies will have to make do with 'actor
career' characters hired for projects or on short-term contracts and moving
on to other companies when the projects or contracts end. The modern
American executive is said to change jobs 10 times in a career. Modern
Britain may not be far behind. A world of such connections bodes ill for
wealth creation. Joseph Schumpeter predicted that capitalism would fail when
it ceased to draw on any sense of 'moral allegiance'. Britain faces that
danger now.
'Actors' careers' and individualist tracks also put the onus on the
individual to manage his or her life. If they choose to rent themselves to a
company, the company will milk them. If the individuals do not like the
milking they can always leave - or ask for more money to stay. That way the
' 1/2 x 2 x 3' formula translates as half as many people paid twice as well
to work three times as long. '24-7's' (24 hours a day, seven days a week)
they call them in Los Angeles. More accurately, they are cramming the
100,000 hours of a normal working life into 25 years instead of 50, which
makes for 75-hour weeks and burn-out at 45.
Milking assets to that extent makes only short-term sense. Work can become
addictive, until we lose ourselves in our busy-ness. But boring people are
wasting assets and addicted people lose perspective. A membership ethos
would encourage a company to take more care to cosset its assets, to invest
in them as well as to work them, to encourage such things as educational
terms and sabbaticals, maternity/paternity breaks, to allow people to
organise chunks of their lives in different ways, and to respect part-time
wisdom and expertise as much as full-time energy. If they do not, companies
may find that they are squeezing out most of their women, as well as some of
their men, who want a more balanced life.
The idea of membership is not the same as the life-time employment of Japan,
for the contract can be ended by either party, but it is edging that way.
The idea of a more restricted role for the temporary investor is not the
full continental European model, but it has the same vibrations.
Meanwhile the Japanese and continental Europeans are gradually loosening
their models of the company and of the capital market, becoming more like
Anglo-American examples. In an increasingly interconnected world,
evolutionary theory suggests different species tend to converge, while
retaining distinctive plumages. Given where the UK is starting from, it
would do us no harm to give evolution a push.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: An artist but not a rebel / Obituary of Derek Jarman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derek Jarman, who died on Saturday, was that rarity in cinema: an
independent film-maker who never sacrificed or hazarded his independence.
His record attests to a stubborn refusal to 'sell out': no other director in
our time has spent 20 years making acclaimed feature films without once
reaching a budget of Pounds 1m.
Yet in a movie age when the cry has been 'Is the money up on the screen?',
with Jarman the answer was always yes. In early films like Jubilee and The
Tempest, in late films like The Garden, Edward II and Wittgenstein, he
rejected star-casting and multiple locations to film with largely unknown
actors in tiny studios, abandoned warehouses or derelict country homes,
borrowed or rented and dressed up in the colours of his imagination.
The 'location' for Jarman's films was his own mind. He came to directing
from painting and designing (opera, ballet, Ken Russell's The Devils) and he
took the self-expressive spirit of the 1960s, the time of his studentship at
the Slade School of Art, into virtually all his later films. These began as
experimental shorts, shot on Super-8 and/or video to achieve Jarman's unique
early style: a dream-like, blurry staccato like paintings shimmering into
life.
Later, some of the improvisatory style and demotic working methods of these
shorts - diary-like records of friends and places Jarman loved - were
transmuted into his feature films. His first, Sebastiane, was made with
friends on a glorified working holiday in Sardinia: a gay confessio amantis
thinly disguised as the story of a Roman saint and playfully scripted in dog
Latin. This prototypical Jarman movie provoked the prototypical dual
response from viewers: delight from fans and outrage from those offended by
the male nudity, apparent plotlessness and historical/religious irreverence.
Later Jarman films brought a similar blend of gay anarchy and licensed
iconoclasm to Shakespeare (The Tempest), the Italian Renaissance
(Caravaggio), 20th-century philosophy (Wittgenstein), the Bible (The Garden)
and the English monarchy (Jubilee, Edward II).
Jarman insisted that he was no rebel: just an artist claiming the right to
survival and self-expression in a homophobic age; and the right to defend
the England he loved - that of Shakespeare, English literature and painting,
and the English countryside - by satirising the England he loathed. This,
for him, was the wasteland of new Toryism as perceived and depicted in his
anti-Thatcher broadside, The Last Of England.
A residual division of style, though, stayed in Jarman's work throughout his
career. While the free-form visual experimentation of his early shorts was
carried over into the daring effects of films like Imagining October, The
Angelic Conversation and The Last Of England, his films based on famous
texts or famous lives were more linear and accessible.
Even here, however, movie orthodoxy hardly threatened. Though the films had
scripts and professional actors and were shot in 35mm, they still startled
us with their seditious touches. Anachronism (motorbikes and pocket
calculators in Caravaggio); music-hall burlesque (Elizabeth Welch singing
'Stormy Weather' at the close of The Tempest); gay agitprop (demos and
banners in Edward II); rampant surrealism (a green Martian in Wittgenstein).
Jarman's humour and his delight in tactical aesthetic outrage gives even his
most 'serious' films the power of laughter and surprise. In his last years
he was the least self-pitying of all artists struck by Aids. His will and
stamina allowed him to carry on working long after doctors had despaired of
his health.
Even in Blue, his last, powerfully moving film, there is wit and wry
defiance as Jarman's spoken thoughts and memories play over that single,
unchanging colour on screen. Blue was for him the colour of infinity, the
colour of favourite flowers, the colour of the landscape elements he loved
(sea, sky). 'Blue', to those who knew him or his work, never seemed the
colour of his mood or emotions, nor those of his films. He was the most
affirmative iconoclast British cinema ever had.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: Slave to the cult of celebrity - The portraits of star
photographer Annie Leibovitz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MCCLURE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The over-muscled torso of Sylvester Stallone, which adorns a recent cover of
Vanity Fair, neatly illustrates both the best and worst aspects of Annie
Leibovitz's portraiture. As a brash, eye-catching incentive to purchase, it
is unsurpassed. On every other level, it is a sham.
Stallone poses nude as Rodin's The Thinker, although the gushing coverline,
'Sly's Body of Art', stresses his physical, rather than any cerebral,
attributes. Inside, further pictures credit a stylist, set designer, hair
and make-up artists, plus there are honourable mentions for 'jeans by Gianni
Versace and sheets by Ralph Lauren'. This is not so much an exposition of
the actor's psyche as a highly orchestrated fashion shoot.
None of which would matter unless a major retrospective at the National
Portrait Gallery, 'Annie Leibovitz Photographs 1970-1990', did not invite us
to view such work as having artistic value. Leibovitz herself makes the
distinction between her magazine work for Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone,
which makes up the bulk of the show, and her lucrative assignments for
American Express and The Gap. These she excludes on the grounds that they
are merely advertising, but there is little difference, either pictorially
or commercially, between a photograph of John Cleese endorsing a credit card
and last month's Vanity Fair cover of Roseanne Arnold, which provided timely
publicity for the publication of the actress's autobiography.
Leibovitz has been contributing to the magazine for more than a decade,
during which time she has become court photographer to the nobility of
popular culture. Her slick, colour portraits of actors, singers and
sportsmen in mildly provocative, staged poses have resurrected the
magazine's circulation figures and have already drawn more than 1m people to
this exhibition, which is touring Europe and the US.
But in helping to foster this cult of celebrity, Leibovitz has become its
slave. Just as Norman Parkinson was limited by royal protocol, so Leibovitz
faces similar restrictions from agents employed to perpetuate their clients'
personal mythology. In a Hollywood, where publicists call the shots and
journalists are blacklisted for penning unfavourable reviews, she would be
unwise not to acquiesce.
Faced with this restraint on creativity, Leibovitz relies on a variety of
concepts to inject life into the proceedings - Clint Eastwood is bound with
ropes; Goldie Hawn perches on an elephant's trunk; Jeff Koons is daubed with
gold paint from head to toe. Elaborate props and posturing are not
necessarily the answer. Her most percipient studies, such as a defiant Ella
Fitzgerald or a world-weary Vaclav Havel, are also the least flamboyant.
In these, she follows Bill Brandt's timeless advice to 'see the subject
first. Do not try to force it to be a picture of this, that or the other
thing. Stand apart from it. Then something will happen. The subject will
reveal itself'. There is certainly revelation in Leibovitz's portraits;
though not in the way Brandt intended. Like Stallone, many of her subjects
strip off for her lens, as if bared chests can be a substitute for bared
souls.
Too often, Leibovitz seems enthralled by her subjects, willing to pander to
their outsized egos. The exhibition is littered with subjects, crying out to
be satirised, who instead inhabit irony-free zones. Even those emblems of
excess, Liberace and Donald Trump, pictured in all their glorious
ostentation, suffer only self-inflicted wounds.
In her defence, Leibovitz has suggested that 'the surface can be as
revealing as anything else and sometimes that's all there is. With some
people it's not going to get any further'. A valid point, but by allowing
her subjects so much control of the image, she only adds lustre to this
surface. (Michael Jackson even gave advice on how to light him in the most
flattering manner.) Leibovitz calls such methods collaboration; collusion
might be more accurate.
Of course, she is by no means the first photographer to contribute to the
smooth running of Hollywood's publicity machine. Angus McBean confessed to
removing freckles and blemishes from his 1930s portraits of Vivien Leigh,
but drew the line at the practices of US film studio photographers 'who
retouched all character from faces in pursuit of apparent perfection'.
It was not always thus. During the 1970s, Leibovitz's reportage for Rolling
Stone captured the seamier, less airbrushed side of that awkward decade, as
she tagged along with debauched rock stars and disgraced presidents. Her
portraits of a dissipated Mick Jagger still tingle with the demonic energy
of his stage performance. Covering the Watergate scandal, Leibovitz was
present on the White House lawn in 1974 as Richard Nixon made his final,
ignoble departure by helicopter, guards quickly rolling away the
presidential red carpet.
These memorable pictures serve as a reproach to a talent gone astray. It is
time Leibovitz withdrew her own red carpet treatment for Hollywood's elite;
the formula is wearing thin.

What I want to see is Richard Wilson (aka Victor Meldrew but now playing the
rough diamond aesthete at Klinsky's) taking that 900cc Triumph round the
reverse-banking on Westway at, say, 55mph with his visor up. In John
Mortimer's auction house series Under The Hammer we keep getting macho poser
shots of Wilson straddling the machine at rest, and footage of some
anonymous person whirling around London on it. But I suspect that, unlike
the late Ralph Richardson, Wilson is not really one of us, a genuine
motorcyclist (9.00 ITV).
Earlier, if all goes well, you can watch Torvill and Dean as they attempt to
win the Olympic Ice Dance Championship again (7.30 BBC1). Even earlier comes
the first of this year's Young Musician Of The Year Masterclasses given by
clarinettist Michael Collins (7.20 BBC2).
The last in a generally good series of Cutting Edge documentaries is a 'day
in the life of' Gatwick Airport (9.00 C4). The final episode of Middlemarch
is repeated (10.25 BBC1).

FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: Rigoletto a clear winner - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among Nuria Espert's productions for the Royal Opera, her Rigoletto always
looked like a clear winner. Some five years on, it still does; it began its
fourth run on Saturday, expertly revived by Daniel Dooner. Ezio Frigerio's
sets loom as superbly as ever, exuding dankness and menace, lit to gloomy
perfection. I thought I remembered 'real' rain in the storm scene - none
this time; but perhaps that had been an illusion conjured up by the visible
gale-force pyrotechnics.
On the other hand, the naughty Duke and Maddalena appeared here to be
working up to a bout of toe-sucking: either that is new or we have become
newly sensitive to such possibilities. With Claire Powell's sultry, sulky
Maddalena and Francisco Araiza's ducal spiv, it seemed likely enough. It was
good to hear Araiza's lusty, forthright tenor again, after a long absence
from Covent Garden. A slight constriction on top notes suggested a passing
cold, but it mattered little, and his troubled soliloquy in Act 2 conveyed a
mature sense of loss.
Leo Nucci returns as Rigoletto, with the histrionics well controlled and a
magnificently scathing, desperate 'Cortigiani]'. His new Gilda is the Korean
soprano Young-ok Shin, pretty, touching and precociously subtle. Under
pressure the voice has (like some other far eastern sopranos) an electrical,
fast vibrato, curiously effective. Their sad last duet is perhaps too
brightly lit: that Grand Guignol exercise is better imagined than laid out
for close inspection.
There is a solid, chilly Sparafucile from Alastair Miles, and confident
support from John Dobson, David Ellis, Eric Garrett and Peter Sidhom as
various courtiers. The three principal roles will be taken by other singers
in the course of the run, as has become the way with Royal Opera revivals -
the Romanian baritone Alexandru Agache, the tenor Jerry Hadley and an
American newcomer, the soprano Maureen O'Flynn; and a different conductor,
Paul Wynne Griffiths, will lead the last two performances.
The current conductor, however, is a notable discovery. She is a 32-year-old
Australian, Simone Young. She makes her mark not by any gimmicks or
radically 'new' readings (for which Verdi's tightly built opera really
leaves no room), but by sheer professional command. There was plenty of
energy, without haste or hysteria - nor any uncertain moment; the orchestral
balance was impeccable; the singers enjoyed close, unfailing support. As the
storm progressed, the off-stage male choristers who do the wailing wind
slipped out of synch with the woodwind raindrops, but that amusing lapse was
the only one. We must hope that Berlin and Munich will leave this excellent
conductor time to visit Covent Garden often.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Monday Interview: Turning the moribund into mainstream - Ron
Brown, the US secretary of commerce, talks to Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne
in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There used to be a faintly down-at-heel air about the commerce department.
It put out a lot of economic statistics and data about people and the
weather but it rarely appeared a big player in government when matched
against the powerhouses of treasury, state department and even, as it
developed in influence over the last 20 years, the small office of the trade
representative.
Commerce secretaries were often political hacks or comfortable businessmen
who came and went, leaving not too much of a trace behind.
To enter Ron Brown's quarters is instantly to detect a difference. They are
as stylish and smart as the secretary himself, perhaps the most elegant man
in Washington. They resemble those of a plush lobbying law firm, one of
which, the aggressive Patton, Boggs and Blow, was his home for much of the
1980s. They are the offices of a quintessential Washington insider, right
down to the fish tanks, the computer terminals and big pictures, beyond
number, of Ron Brown and his many friends, from his president on downwards.
Simply because Ron Brown was just such a person, it puzzles that he should
have opted for dear old moribund commerce when, as one of the major
architects of Bill Clinton's election victory, his selection must surely
have been wider. 'Well, I won't say I wanted to be secretary of commerce
from the day I was born, but one of the things I always noticed was that
this was a department of enormous untapped potential. Anyway, something
about me likes challenges, it was enticing. And our campaign was all about
the economy and I thought this department could have an impact on it.'
That impact was certainly seen just last week when Ron Brown stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with his president to announce triumphantly the Dollars
6bn contract for the sale of commercial jets to Saudi Arabia. He was a
serious player in administration strategies for Nafta, the Uruguay Round and
the latest fraught negotiations with Japan.
His proudest achievement so far has been the establishment of a national
export strategy, which, if European reactions to the Saudi deal are anything
to go by, already has US competitors deeply worried. Its goal is Dollars
1,000bn in exports by the end of the century, nearly double current levels,
generating, he calculates, 6m new jobs at home.
'Government should not initiate contracts,' he says. 'That is up to the
private sector, but if it makes that judgment there should be aggressive
action on government's part to help them.' And why not, he goes on, for that
is exactly what the main US trading rivals have been doing for years.
He can come over as a supersalesman (he prefers the word 'advocate"), though
this would be grossly to misread his talents. His career has been varied
enough - and only his colour makes it relatively unusual. He grew up in the
Theresa Hotel when Harlem glittered and where his father was manager. His
education was at the better private schools in the north east and by 21 he
was a commissioned army lieutenant. .
A law degree from St John's University in New York got him on board the
civil rights movement, with the Urban League. He moved on to be chief
counsel of the Senate judiciary committee under Edward Kennedy, worked for
his abortive 1980 campaign and then moved on to Patton, Boggs and Blow,
where his clients ranged from Japanese corporations to Haiti's Duvalier
family and where he began to make serious money - and some enemies. (The New
York Times came close to opposing his nomination a year ago mostly because
he had been that ultimate object of mistrust, a lobbyist).
In 1988 he managed the Rev Jesse Jackson's bid for the presidency, and he
was still seen mostly as a tool of the Kennedy-Jackson liberal axis when,
against many odds, he was elected Democratic Party national chairman early
in 1989. This induced undisguised delight among Republicans. George Will,
the conservative columnist, wrote at the time: 'Democrats are already
turning briskly to the business of losing the 1992 election and some of them
believe that the coming election of Ronald Brown as party chairman will be a
big step in that direction.'
Four years later a Democratic president was inaugurated. What he did in
those four years as party chairman - raising money, giving Democrats a sense
of purpose and ultimately uniting the many warring factions behind the man
he saw as a winner - he is now seeking to replicate in government and inside
the commerce department.
He did not have to demand a seat at the administration high policy table,
because Mr Clinton's theological belief in collegiality gave him an
automatic place. Like a good cardinal, his opinions are pretty
indistinguishable from the rest. 'We've been consistent for 13 months, we
want targeted, results-oriented trade policies.'
On Japan, this most political of operators expresses interest in Tokyo's
unfolding drama but adds that US policy prior to the summit 10 days ago
could not be determined 'to the depths of interpreting every nuance in
domestic Japanese politics.' More important was the necessity of getting
Japan to abide by its agreements - in the framework negotiations that broke
down at the summit and over Motorola's cellular phone exports.
But it has not been all guts and glory for Ron Brown. It was only a few
weeks back that he was cleared of charges that he had solicited money in
return for helping to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam, finally ended
February 3. He claims he was not 'deterred or distracted' but then says
Washington, which he knows like the back of his hand, 'is getting meaner and
worse.' Still, 'I don't feel victimised, I'm the kind of person that moves
on.' To the state department perhaps? Ron Brown also knows when to smile and
say nothing.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics and telecommunications company, will be headed
by a younger president than has been the case for some time when Hisashi
Kaneko takes over from Tadahiro Sekimoto who has been at the top for an
unusually long 14 years, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Kaneko, 61, has long been considered a natural successor to Sekimoto, 68,
who, as executive chairman, will concentrate his energies on activities in
the wider business community.
The new president, who is currently executive vice president, followed a
similar career path to that of his mentor, and worked for a long time on the
telecomunications
side of NEC's businesses. His rather uninspiring personal style has won him
the nickname of 'mini-Sekimoto', according to one Japanese newspaper.
Kaneko graduated from the prestigious University of Tokyo's engineering
department and joined NEC in 1956. After managing the company's Central
Research Lab, Kaneko moved to the US to become president and chief operating
officer of NEC in the US in 1989.
Kaneko takes over at a less than opportune time for NEC, which is suffering
from the economic downturn as well as increased competition, but the company
seems to have weathered the worst of the bad times.
The new president's leadership and vision will be tested in the years ahead;
NEC will be particularly pressed to develop new market areas as its
dominance in the domestic PC market is threatened from overseas.

FT  21 FEB 94 / People: Jenrette eases up at Equitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After nursing the Equitable through some of its blackest hours, Richard
Jenrette, chairman of the 135-year-old US insurance group, is easing his
grip on the reins of power and allowing a new generation of managers a
chance, writes Richard Waters.
Jenrette, 65 in April, last week gave up the chairmanship of Equitable's US
life assurance subsidiary - though he remains chairman and chief executive
of the whole group. The move allows Joseph Melone, 62, the subsidiary's
chief executive, to become chairman, in turn making room for James Benson,
47, to become president and chief operating officer.
Benson, a marketing expert who learnt the trade at Pacific Mutual Life, was
brought in less than a year ago by Melone (himself a former president of
Prudential Insurance) to drive the life business forward. Now that Equitable
has sorted out the mess in its balance sheet, Melone says it is looking to
make its capital grow 'the old-fashioned way - by making money'.
For Jenrette - a founder of Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette, the investment bank
now owned by Equitable - the 1990s has proved a busy decade. Just months
after being thrust into the top seat, he brought in French insurer Axa as a
49 per cent shareholder in 1991 (when losses plunged to nearly Dollars 1bn)
and took the insurance group public the next year. The question now is: how
long will he stay? Last week's announcement was studiously vague on the
matter, saying only that Jenrette had 'no near-term plans to retire'.

FT  21 FEB 94 / People: Monetary institute truly European
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Though Germany's Gunter Baer, 53, the secretary-general of the European
central bank governors' committee, lost out to France's Robert Raymond in
the race for the director general's job at the newly created European
Monetary Institute, his deputy, Hanspeter Scheller, 51, has picked up the
consolation prize of heading Raymond's general secretariat.
Scheller, who started his central banking career at the Bundesbank, has been
a member of the secretariat of the Bank for International Settlements since
the 1970s. He is one of three new faces who will run the EMI when it finally
settles down in its yet to be found headquarters in Frankfurt.
The EMI has turned to the Dutch central bank for its head of monetary,
economic and statistics department. Gert Jan Hogeweg, 47, who runs the
payments systems policy department of De Nederlandsche Bank. Before that he
did a stint as the Netherlands' alternate executive director at the
International Monetary Fund between 1987 and 1991.
Meanwhile, Jim Etherington, 39, (below), who joined the Bank of England
straight from school, has been appointed head of the EMI's information and
communications systems department. He has been managing the Bank's
information technology operation servicing the policy, markets and
supervision area.
The latest clutch of appointments has filled most of the key jobs in the
EMI's top management team. It still needs to recruit a head of
administration and a head of reserve management. Filling the latter is not
felt to be particularly urgent since it is unlikely that the EMI will be
managing a large amount of reserves in the short-term.
The rash of appointments at the EMI has had a knock-on effect at the BIS.
Baer, who had been the EMI's acting director general, will take over from
Giampietro Morelli, the BIS's secretary general, when he retires in August.
Guy Noppen, Belgium's executive director at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, joins the BIS secretariat in March and will
assume the Bank's administrative responsibilities. Meanwhile, William White,
deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, is joining the BIS and will take over
as head of the monetary and economics department when Horst Bockelmann
retires in April 1995.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel: A breath of fuggy air - Policies on smoking
and cabin freshness differ from airline to airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smoke gets in your eyes and up your nose. And so do bits of fluff, hair,
skin particles and volatile emanations from the malodorous passengers around
you. Taking a long-haul flight is more than just a matter of a comfortable
seat and gourmet food.
Airlines differ in how they treat smokers and how often they change the air
in the cabin.
On the smoking front, they tend to divide into two camps: the anti-smoking
Anglo-Saxon countries, and their former colonies; and the pro-smoking rest
of the world. On the issue of smoking in aircraft, France would appear to be
an honorary Anglo-Saxon country.
In the 'anti' corner, US carriers forbid smoking on all domestic flights.
British Airways has not allowed smoking on its domestic flights since 1988,
SAS bans smoking on flights within Scandinavia, and Singapore Airlines has
smoke-free short-haul routes on its Silk Air subsidiary.
These rules are not as strict for long-haul international flights, perhaps
because airlines recognise that it is harder for tobacco addicts to go
without for eight or 10 hours.
Many airlines have no-smoking flights only on routes where there are at
least two daily flights: smoking is banned on one, and allowed on the other.
Such flights are available from BA, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines
between Europe and Asia, and on many US carriers across the Atlantic or
Pacific.
For short-haul international flights, carriers are more divided. While SAS
still allows smoking on flights outside Scandinavia, Air France last month
banned smoking on flights of less than two hours. BA plans to prohibit
smoking on flights of less than 90 minutes from this summer: more than 400
flights a week will be affected between the UK and much of northern Europe.
Such changes of policy at BA and Air France contrast with the attitude of
German carrier Lufthansa. It experimented with no-smoking flights in 1990,
but abandoned the idea in the face of public hostility. Those in favour of
an individual's right to smoke overcame those arguing that the health and
comfort of others were more important, says the carrier.
Many Asian and south European carriers have not even experimented with
no-smoking policies, perhaps because smoking is more popular in those
regions.
Is it possible for an airline to please both supporters and opponents of
smoking? Air France is trying: it has a special smoking compartment on
flights to Japan and South Korea. Economy-class smokers sit at the back of
the aircraft, separated from other passengers by thick curtains.
While non-smokers may applaud efforts like this, they might be less pleased
by the issue of the freshness of the air itself.
Only US carriers have statistics about cabin air freshness at their
fingertips. Most other carriers contacted by the FT had to consult their
engineering departments, and often did not know precise figures.
The results of the survey show that, when it comes to air freshness, the
type of aircraft matters at least as much as who owns it.
It is not easy to change cabin air frequently. At 40,000ft, the external air
can be minus 60`C and almost completely dry. It must be heated by 80`C and
have moisture added before it is pumped into the cabin.
This all uses fuel, so the latest Boeing and Airbus aircraft, introduced
since the mid-1980s, try to cut down on the waste by recycling some warm and
relatively moist cabin air. Airlines insist that this does no harm to
passengers. The air is filtered using a mesh that catches many bacteria.
Sleeping people extract very little oxygen, so the air the second time round
should be just as capable of sustaining life as it was the first time.
Nevertheless, those who want completely fresh air circulating around them
should avoid travelling in new aircraft, such as the Boeing 747-400 and
Airbus A320, while smaller aircraft tend to change the air more frequently.
Travellers paying for the most expensive seats will get better air quality
than those with cheap tickets. The air in an aircraft flows from the front
to the back; the further forward you are, the fresher the air, unless there
are smokers in front. Moreover, with fewer passengers per square metre in
the more expensive seats, each has more fresh air.
As if that were not enough, one airline has just made the fresh air class
distinction even greater. US carrier Northwest last month banned smoking in
all first-class cabins.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel: High-cost connections - The price of using
cards to make phone calls from hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business travellers once had to accept extortionate hotel telephone charges
as a fact of life. Then came the calling card, enabling them to avoid hotel
rates by using freephone or special connection numbers, which credit the
charge to a phone or credit card account.
Not to be outwitted, many hotels have reacted by barring the access numbers
and placing a hefty levy - euphemistically called a 'connection fee' - on
those wanting to dial access numbers via hotel operators. Travellers
intending to spend much time on the phone should check on hotel policy. One
call could save a large part of the final bill.
In the US, where more than 100m citizens now have calling cards, most hotels
long ago caved into consumer demand and allowed calling card holders to dial
direct. The standard access charge is 75 cents. Access codes for ATT and
the other carriers are often advertised in bedrooms.
By contrast, London hotels generally still try to hold on to their extra
income from phone charges.
The Dorchester was the worst offender in a random survey of six central
London hotels, levying a Pounds 2.50 premium on any call via an 0800
freephone number. The Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch charges a Pounds 2
connection fee for all access numbers for charge cards, including 0500, 0800
and 144 for BT. The Regent's Park Hilton charges Pounds 1.50, and the
Holiday Inn at King's Cross Pounds 1.
Two of the six levy no charge. The Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane does
not bar any numbers. Better still, the Beaufort Hotel in Knightsbridge
neither bars numbers nor charges any mark-up from standard BT tariffs for
direct-dialled calls. 'We believe we are the only hotel in London to charge
guests straight BT prices, nothing extra,' it says.
BT and Mercury say there is little they can do except 'try to persuade'
hotels to charge lower fees. Holders of American Express cards in the UK
will be able to use them as phone calling cards under a deal signed by Amex
and Mercury, the UK phone company, last week.
After applying for a personal number, card holders can charge calls to their
Amex account at Mercury calling card rates - which are generally lower than
BT's but higher than US cards for transatlantic calls. Corporate card
holders are eligible immediately; all 1m Amex card holders in the UK can
apply later this year.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Management: Staff cover proves a liability: Rising insurance
costs for UK business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British businesses increasingly face an uphill task in finding insurance
cover for employees who suffer accidents or become ill through their work.
Employers' liability insurance, which is compulsory for UK companies, has
already become much more expensive in the past three years. Next year the
situation could get worse if, as expected, insurers reduce the scope of
cover offered in typical policies, because of moves by their own reinsurance
companies to restrict protection.
According to the UK risk managers association, Airmic, the issue ranks
alongside the environment and terrorism as among the most pressing facing
insurance buyers.
'It is a problem area,' says Alan Fleming, executive director of Airmic. He
estimates that employers' liability insurance can amount to 40 per cent of
overall insurance costs for some companies.
Premium rates for manual workers have risen by an average of at least 20 to
30 per cent annually in recent years, with rates rising in some cases from
perhaps 0.2 per cent to between 5 per cent and 8 per cent of payroll. The
more serious threat is that employers face even steeper increases for their
white collar workers; rates are rising from 0.01 per cent to as much as 0.3
per cent of payroll.
The background to all this is a rise in claims costs, which reflects a
number of political and social trends. New official health and safety
requirements and the greater willingness of workers, especially when
organised in trade unions, to claim damages in the courts have led to a
surge in disease claims. These now account for between 25 per cent and 40
per cent of the Pounds 500m paid each year in employers' liability claims by
UK insurance companies, compared to less than 20 per cent 10 years ago.
The picture is expected to deteriorate further as claims from victims of new
conditions - such as repetitive strain injury (RSI) and stress - come to the
courts.
A recent award of Pounds 79,000 in an RSI case involving a former Inland
Revenue typist is likely to encourage trade unions which are backing action
by other injured workers and has highlighted what James Hopper, employers'
liability specialist with Sedgwick, the insurance broker, recently qualified
as a 'potential epidemic'.
The biggest headache of all could be finding an insurer in the first place.
A number of companies have withdrawn from the market and no longer offer
'standalone' policies - and more are likely to follow suit. Reinsurers have
become concerned about the scale of potential losses following claims
stemming from the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in 1988.
They have consequently begun to curb the traditionally unlimited cover they
offer insurance companies. Insurers now expect reinsurers to limit cover to
between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m per occurrence, when they renew their
annual policies for 1995. This means insurers may have to introduce changes
into their own contracts as they come up for renewal later this year.
What can companies do? Derek Howie, assistant liability manager for Eagle
Star, the BAT Industries subsidiary, predicts the emergence of a new 'excess
of loss' market where corporate buyers will be able to obtain cover above
the limits made available from their traditional insurers.
But risk managers, brokers and insurers expect the new combination of
circumstances to lead to greater interest in self-insurance, with many
buyers increasing the amount of risk they leave uninsured or self-insured.
Already many larger UK companies cover all claims under a certain level  -
with a limit of Pounds 100,000 typical for some large companies.
'Basically, it can allow cost savings. Companies are managing predictable
claims of a modest size themselves rather than handing over responsibility
to insurance companies,' says John Stoker, a consultant who works with
Tillinghast, the actuaries and management consultants.
Self-insurance can help cut legal bills, which add thousands of pounds to
costs. The self-insurance option is frequently accompanied by a more
pro-active approach to claims management. Companies can also reduce their
employers' liability costs by 'recognising when people have a real claim and
doing everything they can to settle it quickly,' explains Stoker. Trying to
resist all claims is like 'pushing water uphill', he comments.
Another option is to create a captive company, a specially created
subsidiary dedicated to insuring the risks of the parent and its
subsidiaries. Forming a captive insurance company can be expensive, partly
because captive managers must arrange for policies to be 'fronted' by an
insurance company licensed by the Department of Trade and Industry.
According to Hopper, this guarantee can cost between 5 per cent and 10 per
cent of the premium paid. Claims handling charges also add to the expense.
Howie at Eagle Star points out that insurers can provide valuable experience
in advising employers on the complex legal issues surrounding some claims.
Even so, self-insurance can still be an attractive option for many buyers,
especially larger companies. 'In the short term there is not a lot of money
going out,' explains Hopper.
Above all, the shrinkage in insurance cover will encourage companies to find
ways of controlling risk through improvements in management and safety
procedures.
Liz Taylor, risk manager of Harrisons and Crosfield, the conglomerate, and a
former Airmic president, recommends adoption of 'the best possible standards
of health and safety'.
The point is that if employers are unable to buy financial protection for
loss at an acceptable price, they may be forced to step up actions to
prevent losses in the first place.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Management: Fast mover in a changing world - Bessel Kok's
efforts to push Belgacom from bureaucratic leviathan to autonomous
enterprise  / Euromanager to watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bessel Kok admits that Belgacom's image was a standing joke when he took
over as chief executive of Belgium's state-owned telecommunications group at
the beginning of 1992. Delays in connecting subscribers were 'extravagant' -
some 50,000 people were waiting for telephones. The mobile telephone service
was 'lousy' and Belgacom, formerly called RTT, was seen as an unfriendly,
bureaucratic leviathan. 'That's pretty heavy as a core service problem,'
says Kok.
His task - to transform Belgacom into an autonomous enterprise, free of
direct government control - has been further complicated by European
Commission plans for complete liberalisation of ordinary telephone calls by
1998. At the same time, the cash-hungry Belgian finance ministry has started
to size up the company for privatisation, and telecoms competitors have
begun forging international alliances.
But on January 5 this year, Kok announced that Belgacom had achieved the
goals of its ambitious 1992-93 strategy: it had reduced the time taken to
connect most new customers to 20 days - and set a target of five days by the
end of this year, launched a new image, and established a modern, digital
mobile telephone network with Pacific Telesis International, a subsidiary of
PacTel, the US telecommunications group. 'Some of you didn't believe we were
going to meet this deadline,' he told journalists. 'But we have.'
Kok came to Belgacom from Swift, the global money transmission network for
banks, where he was chief executive for seven years. A dedicated chess fan
and professor of strategic management at Brussels' Flemish University, he
arrived with private-sector preconceptions about Belgacom's inefficient
bureaucracy. However, he was 'absolutely astonished' by the attitude of most
of the company's 26,000 staff.
'The company had a very strong willingness to change,' says Kok. 'It went
very deep in the organisation. And if you really analyse it, that's logical:
it isn't funny to be perceived by the majority of the public as a sleepy
organisation that doesn't listen.'
Kok's management style is direct. He began Belgacom's metamorphosis with a
letter to staff telling them 'tomorrow will not be like yesterday' and that
the old monopoly certainties were being undermined by technological advances
and pan-European liberalisation. 'As an organisation, we believe that this
is irreversible,' Kok said. 'As far as our company is concerned, we do not
believe that there will be a return to what we call the old times.'
Since Kok's arrival the group's 4m subscribers have become 'clients', whose
needs are paramount. A marketing department was set up with 100 staff and a
referendum issued to customers to find out what they thought about Belgacom.
The 60,000 who replied said the biggest problem was still the long wait for
service, from installation of a telephone to a simple directory inquiry. Kok
has moved fast to find solutions to these problems.
'Belgacom was late in the process of transformation,' he says. 'That's why
we were in a hurry. The Dutch, French, Scandinavians, even the Swiss,
started their transformation programmes earlier than we did, which was a
pity because in the late 1960s Belgacom was one of the leading operators in
Europe.'
Kok has tried the tempers of his political and boardroom bosses, some of
whom he believes were still steeped in the public sector culture. In late
1992, only 11 months into the job, his management - particularly of the
financial, personnel and mobile telephone dossiers - came under fire from
the board. Kok says he had difficulty coping with the interventionist
attitude of some directors and admits that at first he felt he had more
support from below than above.
'It was extremely difficult for me to implement immediately what I call a
private-sector model of authority and duties,' says Kok. 'In the beginning,
the board perceived its authority as going far more into operational
responsibilities than is done in the private sector.' Kok says the situation
has been 'improved but not resolved'. Certainly his position no longer seems
as precarious as it was painted 18 months ago.
He is no stranger to combat between executive and non-executive directors.
At Swift, which he joined in 1973, he struggled in vain with the
organisation's dominant bank shareholders, who resisted his proposals to
restructure the board, invest more power in the executive directors, and
expand the network to users other than banks.
At Belgacom, Kok also has to contend with the possibility that the
government may launch a premature privatisation. The finance ministry has
repeatedly hinted at partial flotation as part of its modest four-year
privatisation programme, which ends in 1996.
That is a short-term challenge which Kok could clearly do without. Although
a fast worker, he believes a hasty privatisation could do more harm than
good. As he put it in a speech in December last year: 'Privatisation should
be based on a clear decision of the government to go for it and then be
built on a scenario of careful trade-offs (between investment, social and
budgetary concerns) and, especially, appropriate timing.'
Kok's main priority now is to seek other international partners. He has
already overcome some internal opposition. His executive committee warned
him that giving Pacific Telesis a share of the mobile telephone joint
venture was 'giving the jewels away and linking up with potential
competition'. As it turned out, the two companies were able to transform
Belgium's mobile network in five months.

FT  21 FEB 94 / British Steel customers consider legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steel fabricators are considering legal action against British Steel after
the company was fined Ecu32m (Pounds 24.3m) by the European Commission last
week for allegedly taking part in a cartel that rigged the market for beams
and girders.
The fabricators - which buy beams from British Steel, cut and weld them and
then erect them on building sites - have asked their representative
organisation, the British Constructional Steelwork Association, to see
whether there are grounds for legal action.
Mr Derek Tordoff, association director, said member companies were worried
that they may have paid too much for the beams between 1984 and 1990, when
the commission says a well-organised cartel was operating.
British Steel, which plans to appeal against the commission's judgment, said
the facts did not support any legal action by the fabricators.
The association hopes to discuss the issue with British Steel, which is the
only supplier in the UK of beams used in construction. It manufactures them
at its Teesside works.
Mr Tordoff stressed that the association was not trying to pick a fight with
British Steel and admitted it was in a delicate position.
The steelmaker, the association and its members have successfully worked
together to market steel frames in buildings. Last year, they were used in
62 per cent of buildings of two or more storeys compared with only 30 per
cent in 1980.
In addition, both the fabricators and British Steel are fighting steel
subsidies in Spain and Italy which are underpinning imports of fabrications
into the UK market.
Some fabricators believe they may have been paying Pounds 50 a tonne too
much for their beams from 1984 to 1990.
For a small operator using 30,000 tonnes over that period, the overpayment
would have been Pounds 1.5m.
British Steel says effective UK prices for beams rose by only 9 per cent
between 1986 and 1990, less than the rise in the retail prices index. It
said the fabricators' problems stemmed from the recession, which had caused
business to dry up after the period when the cartel was alleged to have
operated.

FT  21 FEB 94 / TUC urges rise in disabled quota
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress yesterday urged the government to increase the
minimum proportion of disabled people that companies have to employ, which
is at present 3 per cent of a workforce.
It said the actual average figure was 0.8 per cent for public-sector
employers and 0.7 per cent for private companies, but that legal action was
rarely taken to enforce the quota.
It said Britain had one of the lowest percentages of disabled workers in
Europe and called for laws to combat discrimination against disabled people
trying to find work.

FT  21 FEB 94 / School absence tables introduced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government league tables for authorised absences and the length of the
school week will be published for all schools in England and Wales this
year.
The decision, to be announced today by Mr John Patten, the education

FT  21 FEB 94 / Save  Prosper to cut card rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Save  Prosper, the investment house, is to cut the interest rates on its
Visa card to below 1 per cent from the beginning of March, Andrew Jack
writes.
The charge of 0.95 per cent a month, which equates to annualised interest of
13.9 per cent, is believed to be the lowest rate charged since credit cards
were launched in the late 1960s. Save  Prosper caused a stir in the sector
last September when it launched its credit card at rates substantially below
the industry average.
The investment house said: 'This is to show that we react to cuts in
interest rates and are much more responsive than the larger issuers.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Manchester prepares to receive angels: Plans to attract rich
investors to small business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 100 wealthy people will gather in Manchester this week to seek
angelic status.
They want to be 'business angels' - individuals who back small companies to
help them grow and thereby grow richer themselves. The aspiring angels hope
a local scheme will help them find businesses with potential.
Capital Access - run by Greater Manchester Business Innovation Centre - has
already enrolled 14 angels. They have so far made Pounds 2.8m of their own
money available for investment in unquoted companies under the government's
new Enterprise Investment Scheme - if suitable candidates can be found.
'This is the difficult part,' says Mr Philip Ellison, who runs the
innovation centre, 'since there appears to be no shortage of angels.' The
centre is acting as marriage broker, assessing high-risk, hightechnology
projects to select applicants for investment.
He had planned a small, private seminar for about 30 people on Wednesday to
promote the scheme. But demand forced the event's expansion to more than 100
places, surprising the sponsors - Pannell Kerr Foster, the accountancy firm,
and the Manchester office of Davies Arnold Cooper, a corporate law firm. The
scheme itself is backed by Manchester Chamber of Commerce and National
Westminster Bank, which has seconded Mr Paul Cochrane, a specialist in
risk-assessment, to work on it full-time.
He will make sure angels are rewarded for their good deeds with tax breaks.
However, Mr Cochrane warns: 'Our advice is, don't make investments to save
tax but for positive reasons, such as trying for real growth. Once in, the
taxation arrangements can be tailored for maximum benefit.'
This message will be reinforced on Wednesday by Mr Peter Cookson, one of
only two of the angels already in Capital Access willing to speak at the
seminar and the only one willing to be interviewed.
Mr Cookson, a chartered accountant, will not say how much he is worth, but
he made his money from being part of two management buy-outs. The first, in
1983, involved a Hanson subsidiary.
He says: 'The Enterprise Investment Scheme only allows 20 per cent tax
relief, compared with 40 per cent under the old Business Expansion Scheme,
which it replaces. You can invest up to Pounds 100,000 per deal, where each
deal's total investment package is below Pounds 1m. The potential tax
savings are not enough in themselves to be much of a driving force.
'The big advantage of the new rules, however, is that investors can become
involved, where they could not under BES. If you can take an active part in
growing the business, it's a way of removing some of the risk from unquoted
shares, especially if you have managerial experience.
'I will only look at companies where I can add value, such as through
advice, guidance and the benefit of having done it before. If someone just
wanted a sleeping partner, I would not be interested. I also want to like
the people involved. The other thing I shall be saying on Wednesday is only
invest what you are prepared to lose.'
Of the 14 angels, all but one want to be active. They would take minority
stakes of up to 25 per cent, or buy redeemable stock to encourage the
business they back to greater efforts so they can buy the equity back.
Most angels are likely to be fee-earning, non-executive directors. Some
deals may involve co-investment with an institution, such as a regional
venture capital fund, with the angel representing the co-investors on the
board.

FT  21 FEB 94 / East London Labour split may aid BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects of the far-right British National party strengthening its position
in May's London council elections have been increased by divisions among
Labour councillors in Tower Hamlets.
In September the BNP took its first local authority seat by winning a Tower
Hamlets council by-election.
It won one of the three seats in Millwall ward from Labour after fighting
its campaign on a platform of 'rights for whites'.
Mr Ted Johns, a Labour councillor in Millwall, last week resigned the Labour
whip and announced his intention to stand as a candidate for the newly
formed East London People's Alliance in the May elections.
The alliance, which has the support of Labour members unhappy about the
party's performance in the wake of the BNP by-election victory, plans to
field candidates elsewhere in Tower Hamlets.
Anti-racist organisations expect the BNP to contest about 12 of the 50 Tower
Hamlets council seats in May.
The party, which has been campaigning hard in the borough since its victory
in September, stands to benefit if the new alliance causes the Labour and
Liberal Democrat votes to be spread more thinly.
If a split in the Labour vote caused by Mr Johns's resignation enabled the
BNP to win all three Millwall seats it would, under Tower Hamlets' devolved
structure, control the Isle of Dogs Neighbourhood, which provides the
council's services in the south of the borough.
Mr Johns said yesterday he had been warned by colleagues that the East
London People's Alliance risked splitting the vote and strengthening the
BNP.
However, he blamed in-fighting in both the Labour party and the council's
controlling Liberal Democrat group since the BNP victory for causing
disillusion among electors and assisting the BNP's cause.
Mr Johns said: 'I will support whatever group has the best chance of
defeating the BNP.
'I believe the new alliance has a good chance of top-slicing support across
the parties.'
An inquiry after the by-election by Lord Lester QC, a Liberal Democrat peer,
found that leaflets produced by some of the Liberal Democrat party's
activists had pandered to racist prejudice.
Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats accepted the findings of the inquiry earlier
this month only after being threatened with suspension from the national
party.
September's by-election took place against a background of severe racial
tension in Tower Hamlets, and community leaders say attacks on members of
the Asian community and other racially motivated incidents have increased
since then.

FT  21 FEB 94 / South-west regroups forces after military blow: A look at
three counties' efforts to diversify their defence-dominated economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month staff will move into a wisteria-clad regency building in
Chippenham, Wiltshire, as part of one initiative to tackle the biggest
challenge facing the south-west's economy - diversification away from
defence.
The south-west has been identified by the Department of Trade and Industry
as having the highest defence dependency in the country. Within that region
Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Avon are seen as highly vulnerable to cuts in
defence industries and military services.
The three counties have more than 70 military bases and Ministry of Defence
civilian centres, 45 large defence manufacturers and hundreds of suppliers.
Defence-related employment is put at 110,000 people or more than 11 per cent
of the working population. But in Wiltshire alone, 11 military bases are
closing or running down in the next few years.
Faced with this pay-off from the peace dividend, the three counties formed a
unique collaboration last year to bid jointly for European Konver funds,
which are intended to aid areas suffering from the rundown in defence
spending. The bid quoted forecasts that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost
in the three counties by the year 2000.
In December the south-west was awarded the largest single tranche of the
funds, Pounds 2.5m of the total Pounds 15.5m UK allocation. Avon,
Gloucestershire and Wiltshire won the biggest share in the south-west with a
grant of Pounds 1.3m. Mr Richard Brown, chief executive of the Western
Development Partnership, an economic forum involved in the bid, says: 'We
got the money because we had a strategy, but also because of the partnership
approach.'
The Konver money, which has to be matched locally, is now starting to be
allocated to specific projects. Among these is the Chippenham regency
building, in which a business development centre is being set up with Pounds
100,000 of European funding over two years. The centre's partners include
the county council, which helped to buy the building, Wiltshire Training and
Enterprise Council, and Workout, a charity which advises redundant MoD
staff.
In addition to training and consultancy services the centre will provide
help in the take-up of new technology. Mr Norman Hayes, of Great Western
Enterprise, one of the partners, says it will work closely with Chippenham
Technical College and in particular aims to support companies employing
fewer than 150 people. 'We want them to have the advantage of every possible
resource to adapt their products to meet market demand as they swing away
from defence,' he says.
Other Konver projects in the three counties include feasibility studies for
the reuse of redundant military bases and a business-networking scheme. One
of the most significant projects, which won a grant of Pounds 240,000, is
for a technology and innovation management team, co-ordinated by Western
Development Partnership.
Its aim is to develop a flow of technology between industry and
higher-education institutions. It will offer advice on new product
development and marketing and refer small and medium-size companies to
colleges or other institutions for help with, for example, product testing.
A team of three counsellors will tour companies, providing free advice for
up to a day.
One idea is to provide technology and innovation vouchers up to a value of
Pounds 600. Awarded at the discretion of the counsellors, companies will be
able to exchange the vouchers at colleges or research centres to meet half
the cost of specialist work and services.
The Konver funding is the first time the three counties have benefited from
any government or European-funded initiatives for economic diversification.
But, compared with the scale of the task in adapting labour skills and
encouraging companies to innovate, there is a belief that Konver is only
skimming the surface.
'The amount of money which has been won for this region is welcome but
inadequate,' says Ms Linda Skinner, director of the Centre for Innovation
and Industry at the University of the West of England in Bristol. 'We will
be pressing hard for more resources to flow.
'Our research shows that, at present, many businesses are not aware that
they are defence-dependent, particularly where they are second and third
level in a supply chain.'
Mr Adrian Kendry, of the university's research unit in defence economics,
says: 'One senses that the Konver programme is being used by the British
government as the lowest common denominator in getting involved in any
serious restructuring. While the Konver programme is laudable, it fails to
address the magnitude of what is required.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Debate on worker democracy urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions should reopen the debate on worker democracy in British industry, Mr
Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said at the
weekend.
He said at a London conference that schemes to increase employee involvement
should cover all workers and not just union members.
He criticised the attempt made nearly 20 years ago, spearheaded by one of
his predecessors, Mr Jack Jones, to introduce union democracy by appointing
union shop stewards to company boards. 'We failed to carry the workers with
us then,' said Mr Morris. 'We did not consult them or ask who they wanted to
represent them.'
Mr Morris said that if works councils were introduced into industry they
should not be exclusively for trade unionists. He added that workers might
well elect trade unionists to works councils, but it would be up to the
unions to convince workers to join them as members.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Boardrooms pressed on standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government-sponsored guide-lines are published today which aim to increase
the professionalism of company directors.
The guidelines were commissioned by the Department of Employment last year
in response to corporate scandals and to concerns that many company boards
do not function properly.
They say chief executives need up to 25 personal attributes including
energy, imagination and openness if they are to be effective.
'I'd be surprised if too many companies were living up to these standards at
the moment,' said Mr Victor Dulewicz of the Henley Management College. 'Most
would admit there is scope for improvement.'
The draft standards, drawn up by the college and the Institute of Directors,
cover every aspect of the skills, composition and behaviour of boards of
directors.
The guidelines say directors have four primary tasks: to establish a
company's vision, mission and values; to set strategy and structure; to
supervise management; and to be responsible to stakeholders.
The standards also establish principles for chairmen to ensure that the
structure of the board is correct and is run in an efficient manner.
The guidelines are likely to meet opposition from many companies which feel
that the behaviour of boards is something that should vary from one company
to another and does not lend itself to fixed rules.
Mr John Harper, development director at the institute and co-author of the
report, said that although the standards did not hold out a promise to make
every company outstandingly successful, they offered a generally applicable
checklist against which companies could measure their performance.
Mr Harper said the lists of requirements for directors were based on the
views of hundreds of board directors interviewed over the past year. He said
that if one board member lacked certain attributes, other board members
should be found who possessed them.
The guidelines are being circulated for discussion and a final version will
be drawn up in the autumn.
The standards, which will be non-binding, are being seen as complementary to
the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance which
has laid down guidelines on the accountability of directors of quoted
companies.

FT  21 FEB 94 / CBI attacks Clarke over complexity of finance bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to be warned today that the regulatory
complexity of this year's finance bill will hit 'the innocent as well as the
guilty' and impose 'additional costs' on businesses.
Mr Howard Davies, the Confederation of British Industry's director-general,
has written to Mr Clarke calling for a review of the way new taxes are
drafted and enacted. He is joined by the British Chambers of Commerce.
Mr Davies says 'the massive length and the drafting complexity' of this
year's bill highlights the inadequacies of existing procedures.
'We are not complaining about the government's need to close tax loopholes
which permit abuses of the system,' Mr Davies says. 'But the regulatory
burden imposed by a bill of this magnitude hits the innocent as well as the
guilty and its complexity imposes additional costs on hard-pressed firms
whose managers' time would be better spent on more productive work.'
The Treasury rejected the CBI's criticisms. 'The bill introduced legislation
which was believed to be necessary to help business and bring about a
sustainable recovery,' it said.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said: 'We understand the need for a unified Budget but things have
got out of hand when no businessman has a chance of understanding the tax
system. Ironically, we have a 244-clause finance bill published within days
of the de-regulation bill.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / EU environment laws will 'cost companies billions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs to British companies of complying with European Union
environmental policy are continuing to rise and will run into billions of
pounds, says a report published today.
Mr Adrian Wilkes, author of the report by Environmental Policy Consultants,
a London-based consultancy, says: 'A torrent of policy proposals is about to
be unleashed, presenting British business with an unprecedented challenge.'
The survey, which identifies 96 environmental policy proposals in the
pipeline, says all companies will be affected by tighter controls on
pollution, the need to use energy more efficiently and requirements to
disclose information.
The report argues that phasing out HCFCs - chemicals that deplete the
atmosphere's ozone layer - could cost the UK food industry Pounds 500m.
'Britain's political campaign to stop the momentum of Brussels policy-making
has failed,' says Mr Wilkes. Ten days ago Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the
environmental commissioner, repeated his refusal to give the UK more time to
comply with water directives.
Environmentalists yesterday attacked the report's conclusions. Mr Andrew
Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said:
'It is the member countries and the European Council of Ministers who are
driving this regulation along - it is wrong to blame the (European)
Commission.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Motorcycle sales optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorcycle sales should bottom out this year at 40,000 units, ending nearly
15 years of decline from the 315,000 in 1980, the Motor Cycle Industry
Association said yesterday.
The year started well with January sales rising 11.8 per cent to 2,626
compared with the corresponding month a year earlier. The figures reflect a
fundamental change in the nature of the market.
Sales of small-capacity machines including mopeds, which made up the bulk of
1980s sales, have tumbled as increasing affluence has wiped out their role
as providers of cheap utility transport.
'We cannot ignore the fact that our market is changing and becoming more
leisure-oriented,' said Mrs Monica Dickman, who chairs the industry's market
information and forecasting committee.
Industry research shows that half of all riders are now classified in the
top three socio-economic groups and that the average age of motorcyclists
has risen sharply, with more than 70 per cent aged 26 or over.
A high proportion of large-capacity machines costing Pounds 5,000 or more is
partially compensating dealers financially for sharply reduced sales.

FT  21 FEB 94 / SIB wants pensions change: 'Cooling-off' period of 14 days
proposed for transfer schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'cooling-off' period is likely to be introduced in sales of personal
pensions to people transferring out of employers' schemes. The proposal
follows recommendations being drawn up by the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog.
The 'period of reflection' would mean that there would be a delay of at
least 14 days between a customer taking the decision to transfer a lump sum,
and the sum itself being transferred.
The recommendations draw on the consultation paper published by SIB last
year about cancellation rights. They also build on the standards set out in
the enforcement guidance issued in 1992 by Lautro, the self-regulating
organisation for the life assurance industry, and Fimbra, the
self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers.
An interim statement from the network of committees advising SIB on measures
to encourage better standards of selling in pension transfer cases is
expected in a week's time. But a full statement will not come until the
proposals have been approved by SIB's board at its meeting in March.
The work was started because of concern about the mis-selling of pension
transfers. A pilot study last year found evidence of widespread
non-compliance with regulators' standards.
SIB's steering group, which is made up of regulators, meets today to discuss
recommendations from a working party. These will then go later in the week
to the advisory committee chaired by Sir Douglas Wass, a former permanent
secretary at the Treasury.
They include plans for the regulators to authorise methods of analysing
transfer details in order to ensure greater standardisation of the systems
used in these complex calculations.
There are also likely to be measures to ensure that regulators are in a
better position to know which of the organisations they regulate are
carrying out pension transfers.
This could mean that special permission from the regulator would be required
to carry out pension transfer business. Some of those involved in the work
believe that the special permission requirement should apply to any business
dealing with occupational schemes.

FT  21 FEB 94 / GMB urges police to 'feel collars'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GMB general union has urged the Serious Fraud Office to investigate
companies that have profited by persuading people to transfer into private
pension plans while disregarding a legal requirement to give best advice.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary, said he was writing to the SFO calling
for an investigation. He said: 'They should start at the top. The fat-cat
directors of the insurance companies knew what was going on. They set up the
personal-pension plans, they organised the commission systems, they failed
to train the salesmen properly, and they failed to operate proper
supervision.'
He told a weekend conference in Epsom, Surrey, that it was time for the
police to become involved. He said that 'millions of people have been
connned out of thousands of pounds each' by insurance company sales staff
peddling 'second-rate' personal pensions.
Police should enter the boardrooms of companies involved, he said, and 'feel
a few collars'. He criticised the composition of the steering group set up
by the Securities and Investments Board in December to try to establish how
many people were worse off. No trade union or consumer representatives were
included in the group.
People who had been made redundant had proved easy targets for the insurance
companies, he said. 'Almost no one can calculate how much their existing
pension will be worth when they retire. So we are all easy prey to a
salesman with a plausible line in patter.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Sharp increase in van financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp increases have been recorded in the number of used and new commercial
vehicles being bought on hire purchase, providing a clear pointer to
returning confidence among small businesses, John Griffiths writes.
Statistics from HPI, the credit-monitoring organisation, show that finance
agreements in January on new light commercials jumped 77.2 per cent last
month on a year-on-year basis. Finance agreements on new trucks rose by 63.8
per cent on January last year.
Finance agreements on used light commercials, mainly Ford Transit-type panel
vans and those based on cars, rose by 46.7 per cent and on used trucks by 63
per cent.
The increases in finance deals are well in excess of those for the new light
commercial vehicle market as a whole, indicating that bigger operators have
yet to start replacing their fleets on a large scale. Total sales last month
of new panel vans rose by 12 per cent compared with a year ago, but those of
new light vans were down 12 per cent.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Barclays says recovery can withstand tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery is strong enough to withstand April's tax rises, says Barclays
Bank, in spite of last week's poor economic statistics.
In an upbeat economic review published today, Barclays says interest rates
are close to their low point and are unlikely to go below 5 per cent.
Mr Alan Davies, Barclays' chief economist, says: 'There has been little
general appreciation of just how far the economy has moved away from the
recession.'
He says recent data 'should not detract from the fact that the overall
recovery has been stronger than expected a year ago. Despite some
disappointment with last week's statistics, the balance of evidence still
suggests strengthening demand and output.'
Barclays predicts growth in UK gross domestic product of 2.7 per cent this
year, rising to 2.9 per cent in 1995. Inflation is forecast to reach 3.2 per
cent by the end of this year and 4.2 per cent by the end of 1995.
Unemployment is expected to fall to 2.55m by the end of this year.
Mr Davies says resilient consumer spending and an improvement in the
corporate sector's financial position point to a strengthening recovery.
Also, 'UK exporters are well placed to build on the resilient performance of
the past year'.
Barclays' view of the prospects for the developed economies is the most
optimistic for three years. Mr Davies says: 'Growth will be somewhat
stronger in 1994, with the continuing upturn in the United States being
joined by recoveries in Japan and Europe in response to lower interest
rates.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Manufacturing jobs 'continue to fall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of jobs in manufacturing is continuing to fall and the outlook
continues to look uncertain, says a report on employment trends in the last
quarter of 1993.
The survey, published today by the AEEU engineering and electrical union and
based on information from the union's local offices, found only one company
in the survey with job vacancies in the period while 15 per cent made
redundancies.
Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said: 'Our survey shows employers are acting
nervously while talking about confidence in the recovery. Our members are
fighting for this recovery. It is time the employers started to do the
same.'
Over the whole of last year one-in-five companies in the AEEU survey
reported redundancies compared with one in 25 with vacancies.
The survey also found a fall in the number of companies reporting good
prospects for orders. They dropped to 17.6 per cent in the fourth quarter,
down from 27.8 per cent in the previous three months.
The survey sample of 413 companies covered more than 40,000 employees.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Names begin long journey through courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court will this week consider the first of 38 legal actions by
loss-making Names which would have been settled in Lloyd's unsuccessful
Pounds 900m offer.
The case is being brought by 366 Names - the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the insurance market - who were members of Pulbrook
syndicate 334 and lost Pounds 44m in the 1985 year of account. It will start
on Wednesday and is expected to last four weeks. The Names are suing the
Pulbrook agency, which managed the syndicate and is now part of the Merrett
Group, and 11 separate members' agents who placed them on the syndicate.
The syndicate specialised in 'long-tail' insurance business in which claims
often emerge many years after inception of the policy. It had a stamp
capacity - the amount of premiums it can accept under Lloyd's rules - of
Pounds 22.2m.
The syndicate has a large exposure to pollution which accounts for 76 per
cent of all its reserves. Chatset, the firm which analyses the results of
the Lloyd's market, says the syndicate's losses could reach more than Pounds
120m, or about Pounds 60,000 for every Pounds 10,000 committed by each of
its Names.
The court is also set to rule this week in a case by two Names alleging
negligence by members' agents in the selection of syndicates. The case - in
which Mr Justice Gatehouse will give judgment - is one of a number launched
by individual Names outside action groups. Mr David Tiplady, one of two
solicitors involved in the case, said it 'could open the gate for other
cases'.
Also this week Mr Justice Cresswell will begin a review of the timetabling
and other aspects of litigation planned by Names. He took over
responsibility for the cases following the appointment of Mr Justice Saville
to the Court of Appeal in January.
The biggest legal action by Names - involving 3,000 Gooda Walker Names -
will begin on April 26. Some 1,950 Feltrim Names expect their case to come
to court in October.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Ulster talks 'will not wait' for DUP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday insisted that neither Sinn Fein
nor the hardline Democratic Unionist party will be allowed to hold up the
next phase of talks on the future of Northern Ireland agreed at the weekend
by the two countries' prime ministers.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he believed there were
'still grounds for reasonable hope' that Sinn Fein would respond positively
to the Downing Street peace declaration. But he stressed that talks - to be
based on the document - would not wait for its decision. He added: 'We are
ready to go at any time.'
His suggestion that Mr Ian Paisley's DUP would also be unable to veto
political progress was immediately backed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary.
Sir Patrick said: 'We should not permit the process to be halted by the
action of those who are eligible to join in but who say, 'No we are not
coming'.' The DUP has refused to join the talks unless the British
government abandons the Downing Street declaration.
Mr Reynolds, speaking on BBC television, said his meeting on Saturday with
Mr John Major, the prime minister, had allayed concerns that future talks
might be narrowly based on an internal political settlement in Ulster.
Mr Reynolds said both sides now had a clearly agreed starting point for the
next talks, which would embrace the so-called three-stranded process. He
said he believed the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
which has not yet committed itself to the talks, would be 'content and
happy' with the outcome of the weekend talks.
It is understood that the SDLP, in an unpublicised session, met Sir Patrick
last week to discuss his 'check-list' of ideas for political progress which
have been submitted to Dublin.
Although London has, in return for assurances about the scope of the talks,
persuaded Dublin to commit itself to pressing on with them, both governments
will maintain a low-key approach at least until after Sinn Fein's annual
conference outside Dublin next weekend.
The next inter-governmental conference is scheduled for March 10.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Lilley faces call to kill welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Adam Smith Institute, the think-tank that pioneered Thatcherite policies
in the 1980s, plans to put Mr Peter Lilley, the rightwing social security
secretary, on the spot next week by calling for the end of the welfare
state.
The Conservative party's leading free-market campaigners are planning an
assault on its welfare state policies, believing ministers have lost the
will to carry through their long-term review of public spending.
The institute will argue that a full range of benefits - such as
unemployment and invalidity allowances - should be privatised and handled by
insurance companies.
It also calls on the government to push ahead with plans to allow more
people to opt out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps). It
proposes that the government should borrow money on the international debt
market so that it can pay more people to quit the scheme as soon as
possible.
Department of Social Security officials yesterday sought to distance Mr
Lilley from some of the institute's 'unworkable proposals' which they fear
could embarrass the government before the local and European elections.
The institute's pamphlet, written by its president Mr Madsen Pirie, is
likely to give a new impetus to the hard core of Tory backbenchers who are
increasingly frustrated at what they see as the timidity with which the
government is pursuing Thatcherite reforms.
A leading member of the Thatcherite 92 Group said: 'Many Tory MPs will be
sympathetic to the institute's call for the end of the welfare state. We
would like Mr Lilley to speed up his review of social security spending.'
Another backbencher dismissed government concerns about the timing of a
controversial document before the local and European elections in May and
June. 'We should not stop thinking about the future just because there are
difficult elections ahead' he said.
Mr Lilley is understood to believe that borrowing money now to help people
contract out of Serps has an attraction because the government could repay
the loan in 20 or 30 years time with the larger sums that had been saved.
However, he is concerned about the problem of paying high interest rates on
short-term borrowings of capital that could only be paid back over decades.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, recently said that the fundamental
review of public spending initiated last year by Mr Michael Portillo, the
chief secretary to the Treasury, had not had a strong enough impact on the
last Budget.
Another rightwing Tory MP claimed yesterday that Mr Portillo's review of
areas such as Home Office spending had not been pushed through strongly
enough. He said the chief secretary had called for a sweeping reassessment
only to find substantial funds had been granted for prison building.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Labour to urge broader role for private finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party will today argue that private finance should be extended
beyond transport and infrastructure in a consultative paper on
public-private partnerships.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor and one of the authors of the new plan,
said the party had 'stolen a march on the Tories' by calling for an
extension of private finance to hospitals, education and inner-city
projects.
The plan is set out in a Labour document called Financing Infrastructure
Investment - Promoting a Partnership between Public and Private Finance.
Labour has long called for private investment for transport infrastructure
projects.
Its latest policy for a public-private partnership is intended to replace
its traditional stance of support for the remaining state-owned
corporations.
Labour's paper says: 'Britain badly needs capital investment across the
whole range of our infrastructure, from the railways to childcare
facilities.
'One potent way of providing it is through promoting a partnership between
public and private finance.'
Mr Brown believes it has proved difficult in practice to bring the elements
together. He will argue today that the government must lead in promoting
partnership between public and private sectors.
The document says: 'We are consulting on a way of setting appropriate profit
performance measures for such bodies.'
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary and another of the
document's authors, said: 'What the paper does is take Treasury rules by the
scruff of the neck and give them a very firm shake in order to open up the
possibility of much greater investment in public enterprise and public
services.'
The document was criticised by Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrats' Treasury
spokesman, who accused Labour of joining the Tories in hoping that private
finance would rescue them from tough decisions on tax and spending.
Everyone, including the Liberal Democrats, wanted more private capital to go
into public transport, schools and hospitals, Mr Beith said.
'But at the end of the day you cannot duck the need for significant public
finance, because many of the vital projects cannot produce a commercial
return, and others require a Treasury guarantee because the private sector
simply does not want the level of risk involved.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Seeking a safe grave for deadly remains: George Graham
assesses an international tussle over how to dispose of spent uranium
acceptably
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weighed against the hundreds of tonnes of plutonium and bomb-grade uranium
now being recovered from nuclear reactors and missiles around the world,
17.5 tonnes of highly enriched uranium from a few dozen European research
reactors might seem small.
But a five-year gap, during which the US stopped taking back the spent HEU
it had supplied to these reactors, has created a crisis with ramifications
far beyond the world of nuclear research.
The row over spent fuel has its origins in a bargain struck by the US, in
the 1950s, and renewed in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To
discourage other countries from embarking on nuclear bomb research, the US
would help them to benefit from non-military applications of nuclear
technology, such as the production of medical isotopes or neutron-scattering
investigations of the structure of metals or ceramics.
To keep highly enriched uranium, which fuels some research reactors and
which could be used to make a nuclear bomb, in safe hands, the US agreed to
take back the used fuel that it had supplied.
In 1978, it went a step further, with the Reduced Enrichment for Research
and Test Reactors programme, or RERTR, under which operators of reactors
were encouraged to convert from HEU to low-enriched uranium which could not
be directly used for bombs.
RERTR has had considerable success, and only four European research reactors
have not begun at least to convert to LEU. 'It's one of the unsung victories
of non-proliferation,' says Mr Alan Kuperman of the Nuclear Control
Institute, a Washington anti-proliferation group.
In 1988, however, the US left European reactor operators in the lurch when
it stopped accepting spent HEU, after a law suit brought by the Sierra Club,
a San Francisco-based ecology group, had challenged the environmental
safeguards surrounding the disposal of the fuel.
The US State Department pressed hard for a resumption of the spent fuel
programme.
'A breakdown of the international consensus on conversion of research and
test reactors to LEU, and a return to an HEU fuel economy, would undermine
15 years of intensive US non-proliferation efforts on this matter and
substantially reduce the ability of the US to influence nuclear policy in
bilateral and international fora,' Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of
state, warned.
But the US Energy Department let the standstill on accepting spent fuel drag
on until last summer, when Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, announced a
new three-part policy. This comprised:
A special waiver of environmental review requirements for reactors facing a
real emergency.
An accelerated environmental assessment to allow the US to take back a
limited amount of spent fuel from reactors facing near-term difficulties.
A full environmental impact statement to allow the US to resume taking back
all the spent HEU it has supplied, and to take back spent LEU for a 10-year
period as an incentive to more reactors to convert from HEU to LEU.
The environmental assessment, due to be completed by the end of next month,
proposes the acceptance of 448 spent fuel elements from reactors in Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland,
for storage at the Energy Department's Savannah River facility in South
Carolina.
The nine reactors face a variety of problems that mean they cannot wait
until the longer environmental impact statement, covering the acceptance of
about 15,000 fuel elements, has been completed at the end of 1995. Some have
simply run out of storage space for spent fuel; others face regulatory
constraints.
They could be pushed into abandoning the RERTR programme and converting back
to HEU, or could be forced to shut down.
Two operators, Germany's GKSS and Belgium's SCK/CEN, have already resorted
to shipping spent HEU for reprocessing at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's
Dounreay plant, in Scotland.
Although Mrs O'Leary gave emergency clearance for SCK/CEN last year, the
Belgian reactor chose Dounreay.
US officials say they have no qualms about the physical safety of Dounreay
but they worry that reprocessing, which the US itself abandoned in 1988,
would perpetuate the use of HEU.
The Belgian plant cannot convert to LEU for technical reasons involving the
level of neutron flux it requires, but is frustrated at the difficulties of
dealing with the US as a supplier of fuel.
'We prefer to continue to be supplied by the US but, if these
discontinuities persist, we may have to look to other suppliers, including
Russia,' warns Dr Carl Malbrain, director general of SCK/CEN.
GKSS has converted to LEU, which cannot be reprocessed, but has told the US
that it has so little faith in its long-term reliability that it may shift
back to HEU so that it can continue to use Dounreay.
For many plants, however, converting back is not even an option, because the
Dounreay plant has to send back the resulting reprocessed fuel and
radioactive waste to the country of origin.
This rules out countries such as Denmark and Austria, which do not use
nuclear power and so have no plan for long-term storage of highly
radioactive waste.
'We are extremely dependent on a solution that is basically doing what we
were doing for the last 20 years,' says Dr Klaus Singer, director of the
Risoe reactor in Denmark.
European reactor operators say there has been a noticeable improvement since
the Clinton administration took over in the US at the beginning of 1993,
though they are unsure as to whether this is due to new people and policies
or because the problem had become so serious that it could no longer be
avoided.
They were encouraged by a meeting in Washington 10 days ago about the
short-term acceptance of their spent fuel, but many doubt whether the
longer-term environmental impact statement will be completed on time in
1995.
'It may take longer, like everything the Department of Energy has dealt with
so far. That's why there is a mixture of optimism and pessimism: there is no
reason for not being optimistic about the long-term outcome, but it will
take time,' says Dr Singer.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Venezuela bank head named as depositors fume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuela government yesterday named Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of the
country's national oil company PDVSA, to head its intervention board at
Banco Latino, the second-largest Venezuelan bank, which failed last month.
He will have to face the increasingly militant demands of depositors seeking
access to their funds and try to carry out a government plan to re-float the
bank.
Mr Roosen's term as head of PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies,
was about to expire. President Rafael Caldera, who took office on February
2, has not yet named a successor.
Before he took the top job at PDVSA, Mr Roosen was education minister and a
senior executive at Empresas Polar, one of the world's largest beer
producers.
The appointment of Mr Roosen, a respected manager, represents a positive
step for the new administration, which is facing a spate of economic,
financial and social problems.
However, still with the unfolding banking crisis, Mr Caldera is also
grappling with political opposition to his efforts to replace the
superintendent of banks and the head of the deposit guarantee fund (Fogade).
The failure of Banco Latino sent has shock waves through Venezuela's
financial system. The government has had to use scarce financial resources
to repay many small depositors at Banco Latino and support other banks that
suffered from unusually large withdrawals in the wake of the Banco Latino
closure on January 14.
The government said last week that four other financial institutions had
received large sums of official financial assistance due to liquidity
problems.
Although neither the government nor the banks will say so publicly, this
amounts to a technical intervention in the institutions, which include three
commercial banks and another financial entity.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is seeking to resolve a nuclear fuel dispute that has shaken its
relations with operators of European reactors and has threatened the
country's credibility in nuclear non-proliferation negotiations due next
year, reports George Graham in Washington.
After five years of foot-dragging by successive US administrations, a draft
Department of Energy report has recommended that the US should immediately
take back spent nuclear fuel from nine European research reactors, some of
which could be forced to shut if they were unable to dispose of some of
their used fuel.
The US stopped taking back the fuel in 1988. In the view of Europeans, it
thus reneged on a decades-old bargain by which the European research
reactors agreed to convert from high-enriched uranium, which could be used
to make bombs, to low-enriched uranium.
If the US were seen not to be keeping its side of the nuclear bargain, that
could seriously weaken its efforts to persuade other countries to renew the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is due to be reviewed at an
international conference next year.
US and European officials say they are confident that remaining objections
by some environmentalists - and from the state of South Carolina, where the
spent fuel would end up - can be resolved by the end of March under an
accelerated procedure to assess the environmental consequences.
'In general, we are feeling very confident that we will be able to initiate
the spent fuel acceptance that is proposed in the environmental assessment,'
says Mr Charles Head of the US Energy Department.
This would allow shipment of up to 448 fuel elements to begin this summer
after a five-year gap, relieving the reactor operators' short-term problems.
However, a longer-term solution will require the completion of a full
environmental impact statement. This is a bureaucratic obstacle course
expected to drag on at least until the end of 1995.
Meanwhile, some reactor operators are growing increasingly irritated at US
unreliability. 'They haven't kept to any time limits,' complains Dr Klaus
Singer, director of Denmark's Risoe reactor.

US President Bill Clinton and Mr John Major, UK prime minister, are to meet
next Monday in Pittsburgh, in a gesture to the time spent by Mr Major's
father and grandfather in that area.
The two will travel back together from western Pennsylvania to Washington.
Mr Major will then spend the night at the White House, as the first foreign
leader to be invited to do so since Mr Clinton took office.
'I know the president is looking forward to it,' a White House official
said.
The arrangements for Mr Major's visit are seen as an effort to smooth over
the apparent rift between the US and the UK.
Besides differences of political philosophy between Mr Clinton and Mr Major,
their two governments have appeared at odds over Bosnia.
Also, friction was exacerbated by the Clinton administration's recent
decision to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to visit the US this
month.
Mr Major's father, Tom Ball, sailed from Liverpool to Philadelphia in the
1880s with his father, a master builder who worked at the Carnegie steel
works in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains.

FT  21 FEB 94 / China political repression 'increasing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asia Watch, the international human rights group, has accused China of
increasing political repression throughout the country, especially in Tibet
where most recent arrests have taken place.
A 664-page report documents more than 200 arrests of dissidents in 1993 and
is certain to intensify pressure on China at a sensitive moment in its
dealings with the West over human rights issues.
The report coincides with a heightened campaign by international human
rights organisations to block renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation
trading status in the US.
President Bill Clinton, who has called for 'overall, significant
improvement' in China's human rights behaviour, is due to decide by June
whether to renew the MFN status.
China is also under pressure at the current session in Geneva of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights. This is in spite of its recent efforts
to counter international criticism by releasing well known dissidents.
Mr Sidney Jones, executive director of the US-based Asia Watch, called at
the weekend for 'continued pressure' on China on human rights issues. His
statement reflected concerns that the US is moving towards MFN renewal
without securing substantial concessions.
'There is clear evidence such pressure has been effective in the past,' he
said. 'Any move now to abandon that pressure would send a terrible signal to
Beijing - open season on peaceful dissent.'
Asia Watch said its lengthy report, entitled Detained in China and Tibet,
'shows clearly that political repression is increasing, not decreasing, and
that it extends to virtually every province in China and throughout the
Tibetan plateau.'
Among specific Asia Watch criticisms were:
1993 was the 'worst' year for political arrests since the crackdown that
followed the 1989 Tiananmen massacre with 250 cases, compared with last
year's release of 37 dissidents.
80 per cent of the new political arrests occurred in Tibet, where the
authorities embarked on an 'intensified' campaign of repression against
Buddhist monks and nuns involved in pro-independence activities.
The number of people detained for 'peaceful political and religious
activities' is far higher than that 3,317 figure given by China as the
number of sentenced 'counter-revolutionaries'. The authorities say there are
'no political prisoners in China'.
Chinese standards of justice remain abysmally low by international
standards, with limited prospects of a fair trial for those accused of
'counter-revolutionary crime'.
Torture is widely practised both to secure 'confessions' and to maintain
control in China's extensive prison and labour-camp system.
Asia Watch said 'a most pressing and immediate need' was to secure regular
access for organisations like the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) to work for better treatment of those in detention.
It also called for more determined international efforts to uphold Article
12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 'ensure that no one is
arbitrarily detained in the first place'.

<TEXT>
Pakistani businessmen are traditionally inclined to blame political turmoil
for their sufferings and commercial difficulties. But political infighting
and uncertainty bring the reverse results for the country's two mobile
telephone companies.
Mobile phones, previously an important status symbol for Pakistani
politicians, have become invaluable political tools for times of crisis when
politicians have to outsmart their rivals.
Next Wednesday's vote of no confidence against Mr Sabir Shah, Chief Minister
of the North West Frontier Province, has put politicians at loggerheads.
However, the phone companies are expecting a 15 to 20 per cent increase in
revenues. The move to oust Mr Shah has the support of Ms Benazir Bhutto,
prime minister, and may end with the chief minister's downfall. Mr Shah is
backed by the Moslem League party of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader.
Tempers have been running high. Mr Sharif's supporters have warned of an
armed confrontation and some have urged their followers to physically resist
any move to replace the Shah government. Both sides have accused each other
of 'horse-trading' and efforts to bribe MPs to make them change sides.
'Mobile phones help to minimise horse-trading. Members of the house can be
taken away to safe places. They can still keep in touch with friends, but
its much harder for anyone to approach them and offer money,' says an
opposition MP in Islamabad. 'Every political being wants a mobile phone.
They feel that it can't be tapped. They feel secure about it,' says Mr
Iftikhar Gillani, another opposition MP.
However, mobile phones remain beyond the reach of ordinary Pakistanis. The
two companies - Paktel and Instaphone provide a service to only 25,000
clients - a tiny proportion in a population of 120m.
Charging between Rs1,000 (Pounds 22.50) and Rs2,000 in a flat fee allowing
up to 450 minutes of free airtime per month, the mobile companies are almost
three times as expensive as the conventional phone network. But costs are
not deterring new investors from entering the market - a third phone company
is expected soon.

<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, has arrived back in the colony after
an official visit to Australia to be promptly greeted by warnings from China
about his plans for political reform.
The criticism from Beijing came as a prelude to an important week for Mr
Patten and his proposals for democratic reform in Hong Kong.
The first of two bills enshrining his plans for limited democracy in Hong
Kong will be voted on in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Wednesday. On
Friday, he is expected to publish a second, more controversial, bill which
provides for more democracy.
Alongside the publication of his second bill, the government is also
expected to issue an official account of the failed negotiations between
Britain and China on the issue of Hong Kong's political development. These
negotiations ended last November after 17 rounds of talks had failed to
produce any agreement.
On Wednesday, LegCo is likely to pass Mr Patten's first bill unamended,
government officials believe.

Elections in the East Malaysia state of Sabah have precipitated a battle
between local politicians and the federal government led by Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister.
In the weekend elections, the locally based Sabah Unity Party (PBS) narrowly
defeated Dr Mahathir's National Front coalition, winning 25 seats in the
48-seat state assembly. But when Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the leader of
the PBS and Sabah chief minister for the last nine years, went to be sworn
in for another five-year term, he was forbidden entry to the governor's
mansion.
At first the governor, a federal government appointee, was said to be unsure
of who to appoint chief minister. He was then said to be sick and
unavailable to carry out his duties.
The PBS said there was a plot to deny the party its position as leader of
Sabah's government. Sabah is one of only two states in the Malaysian
federation which is not aligned with the National Front. Dr Mahathir has
made no secret of his antipathy towards the PBS and to Mr Pairin in
particular.
Last night, almost 24 four hours after the result was announced, Mr Pairin
was still waiting outside the locked gates of the governor's mansion. The
governor announced that a swearing-in ceremony would take place on Monday,
but did not say who was to be appointed chief minister.
Meanwhile, Dr Mahathir said he had received reports that Mr Pairin had
locked up several elected PBS members of the assembly for fear that they
would defect to the National Front. 'They should be given the right to
decide which party to support,' said Dr Mahathir.
The prime minister said the police might be forced to intervene if the
members were being forcibly detained.
The weekend's events mark another chapter in the colourful and often chaotic
politics of Sabah, the former British North Borneo. The PBS has accused the
National Front of money politics on a massive scale.
'Money was virtually being thrown from helicopters and distributed freely in
coffee shops,' said Mr Pairin of the National Front's campaign.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Japan tyre production suffers sharp fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tyre production in Japan, the world's second largest market, last year
experienced its worst decline since the second world war.
The manufacturers' plight was exacerbated by poor demand, falling prices,
and a deteriorating product mix as consumers bought cheaper tyres, according
to the Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers' Association (Jatma).
The industry is suffering from rapidly falling demand in the domestic car
manufacturers' market as well as the replacement market. Production fell
from 166m units to 150m units.
Tyre shipments to domestic vehicle constructors fell 12.1 per cent to 50m
units last year. The fall mirrors a 10.2 per cent drop in Japanese vehicle
production last year, according to recent data released by the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Japanese vehicle exports collapsed
11.5 per cent last year. Jatma said automotive makers had also been
particularly aggressive in driving down tyre prices.
The domestic replacement tyre market also plummeted from 67.6m to 60.9m
units. The association added that mass merchandisers, which aggressively
discount prices, had increased their share to nearly 20 per cent of the
replacement market.
Imports have also been adding to the Japanese industry's troubles. Although
imports fell about 5 per cent to slightly less than 14m units, foreign
manufacturers increased their share of the market which dropped 9.8 per
cent.
The US was the largest importer in 1992 with 5m units, followed by Australia
with 1.97m units, Taiwan with 1.2m units and Korea with 1m units. Japanese
tyre exports fell only 1.2 per cent from 37.4m to 37m, in spite of the
strong yen.
Mr Akira Suzuki, Jatma's executive director, said no plants had closed over
the last 12 months, but extended maintenance periods had cut operating rates
from more than 90 per cent in 1992 to just over 80 per cent last year.
He expected Japanese companies to increase manufacturing capacity in
south-east Asia where costs are lower and demand is rising sharply.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Tough decisions lie ahead for Kuwaitis: Oil prices are weak
and parliament is strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With oil prices near a five-year low, an unfamiliar sound is emanating from
the Gulf states: the creak of tightening belts.
Saudi Arabia began this year pledging to cut government spending by a fifth.
Oman said it must trim its budget by 10 per cent. Qatar is cutting where it
can. In recent weeks, Kuwait has joined in. Kuwait's finance minister,
central bank governor and others have all signalled the need for big cuts in
state spending.
Each Gulf government faces a tough task, since either cutting spending or
raising revenues through higher fees on state-provided services (income
taxes in the Gulf are politically inconceivable) would mark the first time
in recent history that these 'oil rich' kingdoms, emirates and sheikhdoms
have had to face eroding the panoply of benefits each offers their
nationals.
Kuwait's task, however, is perhaps the stiffest since unlike its neighbours
the government has an elected parliament to deal with. And it already
appears that the opposition-dominated National Assembly is in no mood to
fall easily in line with the government's austerity calls.
Such calls have been issuing with increasing shrillness from Kuwaiti
policymakers - a measure partly of the worsening outlook for state finances,
but partly also of the government's appreciation that, for the first time in
its experience, it must persuade a strong and recalcitrant parliament. Mr
Nasser al-Rodhan, the finance minister, has recently begun using such
uncharacteristic Kuwaiti words as 'urgent reforms' and 'sacrifices'.
The reason for such calls is plain enough. Kuwait had already budgeted for a
KD1.2bn (Pounds 2.7bn) fiscal deficit for 1993-94 before oil prices
weakened. In January, however, Mr al-Rodhan revealed that at the midpoint of
Kuwait's June-July fiscal year, the state had already reached 67 per cent of
the budgeted deficit. Worse, soft crude prices forced the government to
revise its calculus for oil revenues - 89 per cent of state income - from
1.74m barrels per day of oil sold at an average Dollars 15 a barrel, to 2m
barrels a day sold at Dollars 10.50 a barrel.
This implies a big cut in revenues, though since the official budget
includes neither defence spending nor investment income, it is impossible
accurately to forecast the budgetary gap for 1993-94. However, senior
officials say they expect Kuwait to manage this deficit from its own
resources, partly through domestic treasury bill sales and partly from
overseas investment income.
Kuwait's overseas holdings were slashed from just under Dollars 100bn before
the Gulf war to nearer Dollars 35bn today, in a fire-sale to finance the
war's costs. But the remaining holdings earned a return of around 20 per
cent in 1993, thanks largely to bullish world equity markets. 'Last year our
assets grew at a rate more than enough to pay for the deficit,' says Mr Ali
Rashid al-Badr, managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority.
But problems lie ahead. Kuwait cannot rely on continued buoyancy in world
equity markets any more than on a sharp recovery in crude prices. But state
spending will rise in
1994-95 as Kuwait starts repaying principal on the Dollars 5.5bn syndicated
loan taken out after the Gulf war, adding Dollars 2.7bn to annual outlays.
Under such additional pressure, Kuwait apparently has little option but to
cut spending elsewhere, or to raise revenues. Either would mean impinging on
the high salaries, subsidised services and other comforts which put Kuwait
among the most padded welfare states in the world.
More than 95 per cent of employed Kuwaitis, for instance, work in the public
sector. Salaries, accordingly, devour 52 per cent of government spending.
Healthcare, power, petrol, water and telephone calls are so heavily
subsidised as to be virtually free. But senior government figures believe
this is unsustainable. Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, the central bank governor,
says: 'Kuwaitis will have to suffer over the next two to three years - we
have no choice.'
The problem will be convincing Kuwait's National Assembly, which, through a
combination of its own industriousness and the diminished authority of the
ruling al-Sabah family since the Gulf war, has become the most powerful in
the state's history. It has already passed laws mandating parliamentary
scrutiny of some state investments, has investigated allegations of
corruption and mismanagement in Kuwait's Spanish investments and is seeking
further to expand its powers of veto and supervision.
Government budget proposals will have to be approved by the National
Assembly in spring. But talk of cuts and other radical solutions to Kuwait's
economic straits is unlikely to win much sympathy. The government has begun
to air such notions as privatisation and direct foreign investment, even in
the country's strategic oil industry. But MPs see privatisation largely as a
process likely to cost Kuwaitis jobs. Talk of even limited foreign
investment in the banking sector was met earlier this month with instinctive
cries of 'neocolonialism' among MPs.
As for the need to cut spending, or raise state revenues, few MPs seem to
consider this message has got across to most Kuwaitis, and fewer show much
inclination to be associated with such unpopular decisions. 'There's not yet
the feeling we must do anything, certainly not that we should make
sacrifices,' says Mr Abdulla al-Nibari, an opposition MP. He also echoes a
widely held view that a government associated with alleged fraud and
mismanagement in the state's multi-billion-dollar investments would find
itself on shaky ground if it tried to persuade Kuwaitis to cut their living
standards.
A tough and perhaps immobilising struggle between the government and the
assembly is therefore in prospect. With this in sight, many leaders of
Kuwaiti society, particularly senior members of Kuwait's main merchant
families, have been lobbying the ruling family to shake up the system and
pre-empt a debilitating political impasse. In private consultations with
Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the prime minister and crown prince, they are
understood to have expressed disappointment with his apparent inability to
impose himself on either his cabinet colleagues or parliament itself.
The next step in what promises to be an intricate ballet by Kuwait's
cautious ruling family, its dogged parliament, anxious economic policymakers
and some increasingly frustrated merchants may well be a cabinet shake-up.
Kuwait newspapers quoted 'highly informed sources' earlier this month as
saying the 16-member cabinet would be shuffled after the present holy month
of Ramadan to enable some much needed 'quick decision-making'.
All of this is bound to be persuading Kuwait's equally financially pressed
neighbours that the last thing they need on top of cash flow problems is an
elected parliament.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Kenya lifts curbs on borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Kenya has lifted restrictions on local borrowings by foreign-controlled
companies, and plans to repeal remaining foreign exchange controls by the
end of the year.
The move was announced at the weekend by Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance
minister.
It is the latest step in a reform programme designed to attract foreign
investment, restore confidence among aid donors and revive growth. Earlier
in the week, in an interview in Nairobi with the Financial Times, the
minister said that the government hoped to remove all foreign exchange
controls by the end of the year.
But Mr Mudavadi warned that economic growth would be hard hit by the
country's drought. President Daniel arap Moi has appealed for international
help for a Dollars 60m (Pounds 41m) programme to feed about a fifth of
Kenya's 26m people.
In his statement lifting the local borrowing restrictions, the minister
said: 'Commercial banks will be expected to exercise their prudential credit
policy in assessing the viability of each borrower.'
The statement also allowed unlimited borrowing by Kenyans resident abroad to
finance investment in Kenya. This would include working capital provided
interest charged did not exceed two percentage points above Libor (London
inter-bank offered rate).
Kenyans with foreign exchange earnings, including non-export earnings, may
now open foreign currency accounts with banks in Kenya and exporters may
hold wholly-foreign retention accounts.
Previously, exporters were allowed to hold 50 per cent of their earnings in
hard currency. Mr Mudavadi said existing retention accounts would be
converted to resident foreign currency accounts but exporters were still
required to surrender proceeds within 90 days of receiving them.
The International Monetary Fund has told Sudan it has launched the process
to terminate its IMF membership, Reuter reports from Khartoum.
The government-owned al-Ingaz al-Watani newspaper yesterday reported that
Sudan had, however, been given the chance to answer before a final decision
was taken.
The finance minister, Mr Abdalla Hassan Ahmad, said the fund's technical
experts would meet soon to consider Sudan's response. Sudan would be the
first country to be thrown out of the fund since it was created shortly
after the second world war.

SOUTH KOREA
South Koreans have expressed concern about US press coverage of the North
Korean nuclear issue, which at times has been alarmist - such as a detailed
scenario for a Second Korean War published in the New York Times early this
month. Mr Han Soon-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, privately
protested about the sensational reporting to US officials when he visited
Washington last week.
In an interpretation that reflects traditional anti-US sentiments, some
Korean media have suggested that the US press reports are part of a campaign
by 'American hardliners' to raise tensions on the Korean peninsula. Their
goal is to persuade Seoul to buy more US weapons, such as the Patriot
missiles that Washington recently announced would be sent to South Korea.
'If a war occurs on the peninsula, the Koreans' survival would be at stake.
But a war here would have little effect on the destiny of America across the
ocean and would rather serve to boost the sagging business of the US defence
industry,' said the national Yonhap news agency.
That view was also reflected in a cartoon in Hankuk Ilbo following North
Korea's announcement last week that it would accept renewed international
nuclear inspections. It shows customs official waving down a truck bearing
Patriot missiles from the US. 'Please stop. North Korea has accepted nuclear
inspections,' says the guard. 'Gee, now where am I going to sell them?'
replies the driver.
'No one can deny that there has been a disparity between Korea and the US in
the perception of the North Korean nuclear issue,' said Dong-Ah Ilbo. 'The
US has been dealing with the problem from a standpoint of global strategy
aimed at ensuring the stability of the nuclear non-proliferation system.
Korea has been handling the issue as a special condition within the
framework of relations between the two Koreas.'
Chosun Ilbo pointed out that differences between Seoul and Washington also
rest on the South Korean perception that it has been sidelined during the
negotiations on the nuclear issue, which have focused on contacts between
North Korea and the US.
POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC
In stark contrast to the hue and cry of the press in Austria, Hungary and
Bulgaria about Bosnia, Poland and the Czech Republic have been almost silent
this week over Nato's ultimatum on air strikes. As the Nato deadline neared,
only the Gazeta Wyborcza, a Polish daily read by around 5m Poles, devoted a
commentary to the subject. The columnist noted that the threat to use force
meant that the 'western world was beginning to rebuild its political,
military and moral credibility'. The paper added that Russia was fighting to
retain credibility as a regional power in the Balkans. 'After being
completely eliminated from the Middle East and after eliminating itself, for
lack of money, from the third world, Moscow is now concentrating on
organising a sphere of influence in its closest neighbourhood,' it said.
This, according to the writer, would include Serbia.
Gazeta Wyborcza adds that the Nato threat, if followed through, would be the
alliance's first military action since its formation in 1949. It would also
mean that Nato would be extending its sphere of influence to Bosnia, a
welcome precedent for Poland, which wants to be covered by Nato's umbrella.
While most Czech newspapers approved with reservations Nato's ultimatum,
domestic interest has focused on the contrasting views of President Vaclav
Havel, who strongly supported Nato's decision, and Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus, who was cool towards Nato involvement. Mr Klaus expressed fears about
foreign intervention, warned of rising violence and said he was 'fully
convinced' that Nato would not make air strikes against Serb positions.
As with most things, Czech concerns tend to be predominantly parochial,
explaining the considerable coverage given to the dispute.
In an article headlined The Protracted Malaise of Foreign Policy the
independent daily Mlada Fronta Denes argued 'the Czech state cannot afford
differences of opinion between its president and premier on the possible
bombardment of a not-so-remote European country'.
The left-wing Rude Pravo warned that subsequent attempts to present the
difference as merely one of emphasis could only put into question the
reliability of official pronouncements on important issues. And the
right-wing Telegraf said Mr Klaus's approach had done the Czech Republic no
good. 'Keeping a certain distance from the conflict does not improve, to say
the least, the Czech Republic's reputation abroad,' the paper said.
SWEDEN
The ski-boot is on the other foot, and it hurts. While Norway revels noisily
in the glory of staging the winter Olympics in Lillehammer - and the
repeated triumphs of Norwegian athletes - neighbouring Sweden is feeling
more than a little put out. As the elder of the Nordic countries (Stockholm
ruled Norway until 1905), Sweden is unused to seeing its smaller cousins
dominate the international limelight. It bowed gracefully last autumn when
Norway brought Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation together for
their historic peace agreement, but magnanimity has been wearing thin over
the past week as Norway has stacked up gold medal after gold medal while
Sweden has so far won none.
A pained reporter for Dagens Nyheter, the biggest selling morning newspaper,
bewailed that the relegation of Sweden's Pernilla 'Pillan' Wiberg to fourth
place in the Super-G slalom had deprived him of the chance to write about
'the girl who was to lift us out of the Norwegian vale of tears that
Lillehammer signifies for us Swedes'. Expressen, a tabloid, put it more
bluntly: 'Swedes only cheer when a Norwegian falls down,' it said,
introducing an article by an ethnologist analysing why Sweden was doing so
badly.
Under a front-page picture in Friday's Dagens Nyheter of a failed Swedish
cross-country skier wistfully watching Norwegian Bjorn Daehlie collect his
gold medal, reporter Ake Ekdahl, his tongue only slightly in his cheek,
pointed the finger of blame at Prime Minister Carl Bildt. 'Bildt knew last
autumn,' said the headline as Ekdahl revealed that the government was warned
months ago of the coming humiliation of the 'blue and gold flag' but did
nothing about it. The message was that Sweden should spend more on training
its sportsmen and women.

<TEXT>
An agreement ending Yemen's seven-month political crisis was signed in
Jordan yesterday with the aim of averting civil war and the collapse of
Yemen's fragile unification between north and south.
The agreement was signed by Yemen's two main leaders, President Ali Abdullah
Saleh and Vice President Ali Salem al-Biedh, but Jordan's King Hussein had
to literally force the two rivals to shake hands.
The crisis began in August 1993 when Mr Biedh left the capital, Sana'a, in
the north for his political base, Aden, in the former South Yemen.
Frustrated by what he saw as a centralisation of power in the north, a lack
of security in the country and mismanagement of the economy, he threatened
to reverse the 1990 union between the two former Yemens unless the
government adopted a programme of national reform.
The document signed in Amman goes some way to meeting Mr Biedh's demands but
diplomats in Sana'a were not confident it would hold.
King Hussein's mediation in the dispute is being portrayed in Amman as a
boost to Jordan's standing in the Arab world after the marginalisation which
followed the Gulf war in 1990. The ceremony was witnessed by dignitaries
including Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in
the largest political gathering in Amman since the 1987 Arab League summit.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Nigeria to face debt arrears pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LAGOS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British government officials are expected to express concern about Nigeria's
growing external debt arrears, in talks in London today with Mr Kalu Kalu,
the country's finance minister.
Arrears on Nigeria's Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) external debt exceed Dollars
6bn and are expected to reach Dollars 8.5bn by the end of this year. The
military government's decision to revalue the naira in last January's budget
and reintroduce an import licensing system has deepened the rift with the
International Monetary Fund. Most creditors now rule out an early policy
agreement with the Fund, on which debt rescheduling would be conditional.
Mr Kalu, who arrived in London at the weekend, is on a 10-day visit to
London, Washington and Paris in an attempt to restore confidence in General
Sani Abacha's regime.
Gen Abacha dropped plans for a handover to an elected civilian government,
prompting western governments to introduce limited sanctions, including visa
restrictions.
During his meetings Mr Kalu will try to convince officials that Nigeria will
keep its promise to remove the budget deficit, and that government controls
on the economy will be relaxed by the middle of this year.
He is also likely to point out that the decline in oil prices has wiped at
least 30 per cent off Nigeria's export earnings in the past 12 months.
Western creditors were dismayed when the 1994 budget pegged interest rates
well below inflation, centralised the allocation of foreign exchange and
fixed the exchange rate at twice its market value.
Over half Nigeria's external debt and nearly all the arrears are owed to the
Paris Club, which has linked debt relief to economic policies approved by
the the IMF.
Economists have raised doubts about the forecast balanced budget which makes
no provision for servicing domestic debt, which officials estimate at N370bn
(Pounds 11.5bn).
Mr Kalu, who as finance minister in 1986 argued strongly for economic
reforms based on a market-determined exchange rate, has put his reputation
at stake since his appointment to the ministry by General Abacha.
Most observers saw the budget as incompatible with the private views of Mr
Kalu, who has worked for the World Bank. Many fear that control of policy
making is in the hands of a clique of populist politicians who oppose Mr
Kalu's prescription for economic deregulation.

The murder of 15 African National Congress election campaigners at the
weekend cast a shadow over preparations for South Africa's first all-race
poll, while constitutional negotiations aimed at averting a right-wing
election boycott appeared to have foundered.
An important session of multi-party constitutional talks will go ahead today
to pass final amendments to the 1993 constitution in an effort to
accommodate the right wing by strengthening the powers of regional
governments and creating the possibility of an Afrikaner homeland after the
elections.
The African National Congress is to hold last-minute meetings with two of
the three members of the right-wing Freedom Alliance - the government of the
black homeland of Bophuthatswana and the Afrikaner Volksfront - before
today's session, but negotiators were not optimistic.
They said it appeared that the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi would not accept the amendments, and prospects for persuading the
other two groups to contest elections were also slim, though some moderate
members of each group might split from their hardline leaders. This would
weaken the right politically, but might not substantially affect right-wing
opposition to elections.
The risks of failure were highlighted when two 12-year-olds, 10 teenagers
and three young adults were shot and stabbed to death on Saturday before an
ANC voter-education drive in the rural Natal village of Creighton. Local ANC
chairman Harry Gwala blamed supporters of Chief Buthelezi, who is
campaigning for a boycott of the election.
In a fighting speech yesterday to some 20,000 supporters the chief told his
supporters they might have to die for their beliefs. He vowed never to
submit to ANC dominance, saying an ANC government would oppress his people
more cruelly than the white apartheid government had done. 'It is far more
noble to resist evil and die if necessary for what you believe in than to
live in chains,' he said.
Chief Buthelezi is not alone in his opposition. Mr Lucas Mangope, leader of
the Bophuthatswana homeland, warned in an address on Saturday that he would
accept nothing less than self-determination for his Batswana tribe.
'If this means an intensification of the long-running campaign to. . .
topple my government then we will fight fire with fire,' he said.
Mr Mangope and Chief Buthelezi have joined forces in the Freedom Alliance
with white conservatives including former army chief Constand Viljoen's
Afrikaner Volksfront. The Afrikaans newspaper Rapport said yesterday it had
documents detailing AVF plans for a civil war if the election goes ahead,
although the AVF said these were not genuine.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spanish government and regional authorities face crucial talks this week on
the future of a Japanese-controlled car plant in the southern town of
Linares, where roughly half the population took to the streets in a protest
at the weekend.
The threatened closure of Santana Motor, a subsidiary of Suzuki making
four-wheel-drive vehicles, could become a big political issue four months
before regional elections in Andalucia, a stronghold of the country's ruling
Socialists and home territory of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister.
The demonstration on Saturday, involving an estimated 25,000 to 30,000
townspeople, was provoked by Santana's announcement that it was seeking
protection from creditors after heavy losses.
The Santana plant employs 2,400 and is the only large factory in the area
since the disappearance of the town's mining. About 60 per cent of the
Linares people are reckoned to depend on it.
Mr Juan Manuel Eguigaray, industry minister, is to meet management today.
Suzuki, which owns about 80 per cent of the company, said it was willing to
plough in Pts5.27bn (Pounds 25.4m) to cover losses from the start of last
year, but no more. The Madrid stock exchange commission suspended trading in
Santana shares on Friday.
Unions blamed the Socialist regional authorities, the Madrid government and
Suzuki. They accused the company of 'blackmail' and of using the workforce
as hostages to obtain subsidies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Support for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has fallen below
50 per cent for the first time since he took office last March, according to
a poll published yesterday, reports John Ridding in Paris.
The IFOP poll, in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the percentage of
voters satisfied with Mr Balladur had fallen by nine points to 47 per cent
over the past month. The proportion of dissatisfied voters increased by 10
points to 43 per cent.
This followed other polls of the past few weeks which have shown a decline
from an unusually high approval of more than 60 per cent. They appear to
reflect concerns about the government's failure to curb the rise in
unemployment, as well as issues such as the fishermen's strike this month.
Political analysts pointed out that support for Mr Balladur remains high,
compared with previous French prime ministers and his international
counterparts.
The decline in his popularity has, however, given heart to political
opponents. Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party leader, who trails Mr Balladur
in the polls, said the political left would be in a position to challenge
the prime minister in presidential elections due in May next year. Mr
Balladur has also faced criticism within the coalition government over the
economy.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Dutch propose first tax on mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Netherlands is set to become the first country in the world to levy a
special tax on mobile telephones.
The Dutch government is proposing to impose a 7.5 per cent tax on the
profits of companies operating new digital cellular networks, when licences
are issued this year.
The tax has been approved by the Dutch cabinet over objections from the
business community, but it has still to be endorsed by parliament. If it
passes, the two operators of networks built to the pan-European digital GSM
standard will be obliged to pay the tax.
The GSM tax may be taken as a precedent for similar levies elsewhere. The
practice of auctioning cellular mobile licences is well established but, as
mobile telephony moves into the mass consumer market, the medium-term
revenue potential of a special tax is considerable.
The Dutch government argues that the tax will be fair because it plans to
allow only two GSM operators. These are KPN, the state post and
telecommunications company which is slated for privatisation in June, and a
second, private-sector operator which will be chosen in the second half of
1994. The government considered, but rejected, a proposal to charge each
operator an up-front fee of about Fl 500m (Pounds 172m).
Greece, with GDP barely a quarter that of the Netherlands, two years ago
raised the equivalent of Pounds 110m each for two GSM licences. The US
expects to raise more than Dollars 10bn next year in an auction of licences
for Personal Communications Services, a new cellular technology.
The Dutch levy would be on pre-tax profits. Payments would be
tax-deductible, taking the effective rate down to about 5 per cent. There
would be no immediate revenue because it would take operators a few years to
achieve profitability.
The proposed tax, devised by the Dutch Finance Ministry, has been attacked
by KPN and business groups as a 'penalty on innovation' when the Netherlands
is already behind other western European countries in the introduction of
GSM networks. It has also been criticised by the Labour party, the junior
partner in the governing coalition, and by the right-wing Liberals.
However, the prospect of the tax does not appear to have deterred potential
bidders. KPN expects to launch its network in July and competition for the
second licence will be fierce. The three main Dutch banks - ABN Amro, ING
and Rabobank - are expected to put in bids with local and international
telecoms partners.
The second operator is unlikely to get its own GSM network off the ground
before 1995, but KPN will be required to open its network to its competitor
while this second network is being built.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's engineering industry will face its worst labour conflict in more
than 10 years if employers persist with their demands for a pay freeze and
an end to holiday bonuses, Mr Klaus Zwickel, president of the IG Metall
union, warned at the weekend.
The union had enough reserves to fund stoppages for several weeks, despite
the cost of DM41m (Pounds 16.1m) a week for every 100,000 people called out,
he said.
Bracing members for selective strikes, expected to start in the second week
of March, Mr Zwickel said talks could resume only if employers tabled a firm
new offer.
However, industry officials showed no signs of obliging. Mr Dieter Kirchner,
chief executive of the Gesamtmetall employers' association, said he no
longer believed a peaceful settlement was possible. IG Metall had removed
the prospect by demanding the employers should surrender their position as a
precondition for further talks, he added.
The union's national leadership is due to meet in Frankfurt today to select
the region in which to call the first strike ballot. The old industrial
heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Hesse and the northern part of
Baden-Wurttemberg, are among the most likely targets.
The choice will depend on the union's chances of causing maximum national
disruption by cutting off supplies of parts and equipment for factories
elsewhere, and regional leaders' reports on the likelihood of winning
maximum backing in a ballot. Strike action requires a 75 per cent Yes vote.
Despite the apparent inevitability of stoppages, observers suggest the
conflict will be short-lived, although bitter. Employers have warned they
will resort to lock-outs at non-striking factories affected by stoppages
elsewhere.
If no negotiated solution is found in the period between the ballot and the
start of strikes, industry observers expect the two sides to agree to
binding arbitration sooner rather than later.
Both sides have already shown considerable flexibility. The union has
backtracked on original claims for wage rises of up to 6 per cent, while
employers have relaxed their insistence on the scrapping of holiday bonuses,
worth some 75 per cent of a month's pay.
The main difficulty has arisen over the issue of how workers should be paid
for working flexible hours - between 30 and 40 hours a week according to
individual factories' needs.
Although both sides have already accepted this in principle as the most
suitable means of slowing the rate of job cuts, Gesamtmetall claims the
union's demands will raise hourly pay rates and unit labour costs.
The employers justified their original proposals, based on a nil pay
increase, with claims that German wages were making the whole industry
uncompetitive.
Labour costs in the automotive industry, for example, are now almost double
those in the UK.
Although the figures are not strictly comparable, since social contributions
account for 43 per cent of German wage bills compared with 27 per cent in
Britain, such disparities are blamed for the wave of engineering job cuts,
running at around 30,000 a month.
The most damaging engineering strike in recent history was in 1984, when IG
Metall led stoppages for several weeks in pursuit of reduced working time.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today faces one of the greatest challenges of his
long career in German politics: to persuade his own Christian Democratic
Union to shake off a mood of deep pessimism and believe that it can win the
general election in October.
The odds are against him when some 1,000 delegates assemble in Hamburg for
the three-day party conference to launch an eight-month marathon election
campaign. The CDU is trailing behind the rival Social Democratic party (SPD)
in the opinion polls, and Mr Kohl's own popularity stands even lower.
The latest poll by the Allensbach institute put the CDU and the Christian
Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian sister party, on a combined 35.1 per cent
in both halves of the country, against 40.9 per cent for the SPD. As for the
chancellor's personal rating, it stood at 26 per cent last week, against 35
per cent for Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful challenger leading the SPD.
A large majority of electors now expects a change of government in October,
and even in the ruling parties there is no majority in favour of maintaining
the current coalition between CDU, CSU and the liberal Free Democratic party
(FDP).
Reports from local party organisers around the country suggest gloom about
Mr Kohl's prospects, not only for re-election as chancellor in eight months,
but also for the CDU to stage a comeback in a string of local and state
polls over the intervening months.
Yet Mr Kohl is clearly intending to rely on his own irrepressible
self-confidence, and an attitude of extraordinary calm and composure, to
shrug off all fears of defeat.
In two interviews last week, he showed a refusal to pay attention to the
polls, or to national pessimism about the economic recession and rising
unemployment.
The Allensbach opinion poll also showed one other key trend in Mr Kohl's
favour: voters are starting to drift back to the main parties - both SPD and
CDU - from the protest parties. The extreme right-wing Republicans showed a
drop in support of almost half, from 4.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, and the
Greens showed a fall from 10.2 per cent to 9 per cent. The SPD was up four
percentage points on the previous poll in December, and the CDU by two
points.
In spite of a large grumbling minority within the CDU about Mr Kohl's lack
of direction in his leadership, and his own unpopularity, no one expects any
serious attempt at a coup against him at the party conference.
The official aim is to endorse a new basic political programme for the
party, its first new draft since 1978, and in particular, the first for a
unified Germany.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Disputes on details may hinder EU enlargement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concern is growing that negotiations to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and
Norway into the European Union by next January could sink into a quagmire of
detail, during the final stretch of ministerial talks starting today in
Brussels.
The two-day talks between foreign ministers of the 12 and the four
applicants will be followed by marathon negotiations over February 25-28,
and probably a third attempt in early March.
Unless a deal is finalised by the second week of March, the European
Parliament will be unable to examine the accession treaty and the referenda
all four candidates have promised their voters could be blown off course.
In spite of some softening by both sides on central issues such as
agriculture and regional subsidies, tough bargaining on secondary issues and
on money is spreading pessimism among negotiators.
Mr Esko Aho, the Finnish prime minister, said on Friday that EU prime
ministers' support for enlargement had not percolated down to the
negotiating table.
One EU negotiator said at the weekend it was becoming 'more and more
difficult to get a deal within the Union,' especially on how much money the
relatively rich candidates should put into the EU budget, on fishing rights,
and on subsidies to Nordic and Alpine farmers and the thinly populated
Arctic regions of Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Spain is leading attempts to get the new members' net financial
contributions to the EU funnelled into regional aid for southern member
states. But the European Commission's plan to set the four's net EU charges
at a modest Ecu1.7bn (Pounds 1.3bn) is building resistance to a solution on
agriculture and regional aid that the four applicants could sell to their
voters.
Attitudes are hardening inside the 12, moreover, because Sweden says it can
pay only 40 per cent of its estimated annual Ecu765m net contribution in the
first three years of membership, while Austria too wants to phase in its net

Spain, with support from the UK, wants guarantees that EU expansion will not
dilute the existing rules enabling alliances within the 12 to block measures
affecting their national interests.
Nevertheless, negotiators expect early progress on issues such as
restrictions on buying holiday homes in the candidate countries, on scaling
down Nordic alcohol monopolies, and on Nordic duty-free regimes.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Defiant Serbs drink toast to Russia: Soldiers were confident
Nato deadline would pass without air strikes

Bosnian Serb forces, coolly defiant to the last, laid plans for campfire
barbecues and night skiing on the hills around Sarajevo yesterday, confident
Nato's deadline would pass without air strikes on their remaining guns, AP
reports from Pale.
'We want to make it easier for Nato planes to spot us,' joked a Serb officer
as he outlined plans for roasting oxen and lambs over fires on Mount
Trebevic, overlooking Sarajevo.
Hundreds of Serbs chanting 'Greater Serbia' and 'Long Live Russia' gave a
heroes' welcome to their Orthodox Slav brothers - Russian peacekeepers en
route to Sarajevo - as they arrived in this Bosnian Serb stronghold, about
10 miles to the south-east.
Home-made brandy, bread and salt were passed in traditional welcome as
soldiers and Serbs alike exulted. 'We feel safe now, because they're our
brothers,' said a 15-year-old Serb girl, weeping with joy. 'Everybody here
feels the same.'
It was a Russian pledge last Thursday to bring the 400 peacekeepers to
Sarajevo that enabled Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to
promise to withdraw the heavy guns that have besieged and bombarded the
Bosnian capital for almost two years.
Mr Karadzic himself was among the crowd shaking hands with the Russian
soldiers, who held out three fingers in the traditional Serb victory sign.
Children clambered over the trucks and armoured personnel carriers in the
67-vehicle Russian convoy, saluting the soldiers.
The Bosnian Serb Olympics, being held in memory of the Sarajevo Olympics 10
years ago, scheduled night skiing on the slopes of Mount Jahorina just five
hours before Nato's ultimatum expired at midnight GMT.
In Grbavica, a Serb-held section of southern Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb forces
showed no fear of Nato bombs.
'We are not afraid. we can fight back their infantry attacks with our
7.62-calibre automatic rifles, which are not supposed to be under UN
control,' said Second Lt Danko Przulj, speaking in a bunker built in what
used to be a heating plant.
His bunker is only 70 yards from Bosnian government troop positions across
the Miljacka river that flows through Sarajevo. From two loopholes, the
buildings housing Sarajevo defenders could be clearly seen.
'The latest ceasefire has been respected by both sides,' said Lt Przulj. 'It
was never as quiet as it has been in the past 10 days.'
Grbavica streets saw heavy fighting between former neighbours in May 1992,
early into Sarajevo's 22-month siege. Damaged buildings stand in mute
testimony to destroyed friendship and joint life in multi-ethnic Sarajevo.
Black plastic covers about 50 feet high hang like curtains between
buildings, shielding residents from the government snipers who residents
claimed have killed many Grbavica civilians.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Roar of jets amplifies Nato threat

   AVIANO AIR BASE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a huge hangar at Aviano, a northern Italian frontline air base for Nato
operations over Bosnia, the defence ministers of France, Italy, the
Netherlands, the UK and the US yesterday approved final plans for attack
missions over Sarajevo. The ministers met just hours before the UN and Nato
commanders decided early today that air strikes were not necessary 'at this
stage'.
Throughout the day, the ministers spoke of 'comforting signs' of Serb
compliance with the UN ultimatum. But they also made it clear their
determination to use force if necessary.
On the timing of any attack mission, the ministers have been cautious.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said verification on the ground
was essential and it would not be possible to know if the Serbs had properly
complied with the withdrawal requirements precisely at midnight.
This suggested that commanders on the ground were being given discretion to
check the positions of weapons and that any military action would be delayed
for some hours - if not considerably longer.
The threat to use force was emphasised by the thunderous roar of US F-16 and
F-18 jets as they took off for reconnaissance missions over the war zone
before and during the ministers' press conference yesterday afternoon.
Mr Walter Perry, in his first important overseas mission since becoming US
defence secretary, said he was fully satisfied by Nato's combat-readiness.
He also said the rules of engagement had been agreed among the US allies.
The US is supplying just over half the 226 combat and support aircraft
involved in the Bosnian operations.
However, he admitted that bad weather over Sarajevo was 'a significant
handicap'. For the past month operations have been limited and some of the
pilots here have said in private that with poor visibility, precision
operations are difficult despite the technology available.
Mr Perry himself said that even if weather was a limiting factor this would
not stop Nato action. In a communique after their meeting, held with Nato
commanders and a representative of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, the
ministers stated their determination 'to support actions to end the
slaughter of innocent civilians in Sarajevo and reinvigorate the peace
negotiations'.
The ministers refused to be drawn on whether the Serbs had abused the spirit
of their agreement to withdraw by concentrating their heavy weapons in
strategic sites or in areas which were heavily populated - thus complicating
any combat mission by Nato. However, they said UN forces on the spot would
be able to take control of those Serb weapons which were not in the
designated places, and they would also have the authority to disable them.
The operations are being co-ordinated by Admiral Michael Boorda, the
commander of Nato's southern flank, from his headquarters outside Naples.
The Italians as neighbours of former Yugoslavia have been excluded from any
combat role, but yesterday Mr Fabbio Fabri, defence minister, said Italy
would put all its resources at the disposal of Nato forces. He also played
down the threat of an attack or terrorist operations by Serb extremists
against Italy.
The peculiar nature of the war on western Europe's doorstep was highlighted
in Aviano by the big Sunday crowds which gathered to see the activity at the
air base. Many families with children watched as US jets, fully loaded with
bombs and missiles, took off and landed. These aircraft with the same
ordnance could be in action within hours and were less than 30 minutes'
flying time away from Sarajevo.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Moscow 'cannot follow' the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Britain's leading political scientists has sharply attacked
expectations that the former Soviet Union could become a fully fledged
market economy, arguing that it does not have the legal and cultural
infrastructure which allowed such a development in the west.
In a pamphlet published today, Dr John Gray of Oxford University claims that
western governments are mistaken to think that Russia will converge smoothly
on a western model of economic development.
In particular, he attacks recent attempts by economists such as Dr Jeffrey
Sachs to transform the Soviet economy by means of 'shock therapy'.
These countries, he says, 'lack almost entirely the legal and institutional
infrastructure of the market on which economic take-off was based'. But he
also argues that these legal and institutional structures cannot be created
quickly by policymakers.
He argues that such institutions are 'human practices that always come
deeply embedded in matrices of cultural tradition'. They 'are like natural
languages in that it is their very nature to be plural and diverse.'

together Armenia and Azerbaijan

<TEXT>
A breakthrough in the five-year-old conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, the
Armenian-dominated enclave in Azerbaijan, may be in sight. This follows a
Russian-arranged ceasefire agreed at the weekend and a proposal for a
meeting of leaders of the two warring neighbours early next month.
The Azeri leadership said in the capital, Baku, yesterday that defence
ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia had agreed in Moscow with General Pavel
Grachev, Russian defence minister, on an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal
of the forces of both sides to predetermined positions.
A complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from Azerbaijan would depend on
further negotiations.
The agreement came after further fierce fighting between Armenian and Azeri
forces in the region of Kelbadjar on the borders of Nagorno Karabakh.
Armenian forces now occupy 25 per cent of Azeri territory on both sides of
the Karabakh enclave and more than 1m Azeris have been made refugees, most
of them living in tents around Baku.
In an interview yesterday Azeri President Haydar Aliev was cautious, saying
that 'there have been many ceasefires - the important question is the total
withdrawal of the Armenians from our territory and then we can talk about
Nagorno Karabakh.'
Mr Aliev, the former Communist party leader of Azerbaijan who returned to
power last year in a bloodless coup, said that Nagorno Karabakh, which has
declared its independence, must be recognised as part of Azerbaijan.
'After that, discussions on its status are open,' he said. 'We can agree to
many kinds of status and as president I guarantee all rights to the
Armenians living there.'
Mr Vafa Gulizade, the presidential adviser on foreign affairs, said that
'the most important thing about this agreement is that it is guaranteed by
the Russians. The Russians can force the Armenians to withdraw if they want,
because Armenia is entirely dependent on Russia for its survival.'
The two neighbouring countries, whose hostilities have escalated since the
Armenian parliament declared Nagorno Karabakh part of Armenia four years
ago, are now both members of the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent
States.
Both, especially Armenia, remain closely tied to the Russian economy.
However, Azerbaijan possesses very large oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. A
contract with a western consortium of oil companies, led by British
Petroleum, but with the probable participation of the Russian state oil
company Lukoil, is expected to be signed shortly.
Mr Aliev is due to arrive in London tomorrow for talks with Mr John Major,
the prime minister.
He said the talks aimed at 'bringing about a better understanding in the
west of Azerbaijan's position, especially on Nagorno Karabakh.'

Weary of war and broken promises, Sarajevans shrugged in resignation
yesterday as word spread that not all Serb siege guns would be surrendered
by midnight in accordance with the Nato ultimatum, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
'I haven't had high hopes since day one of the ultimatum,' said Alen
Becirbegovic, 22, a soldier in the Moslem-led Bosnian army. 'The Nato threat
wasn't strong enough. The Serbs outwitted Nato and the United Nations.'
'What's left of these weapons should be bombed,' said 27-year-old Anis
Mehic, a student. 'Ultimatums should be carried out in full measure.
Otherwise we are just spinning in small circles.'
The weather lifted in Sarajevo yesterday after several days of snow and the
streets were crowded with people pulling sledges loaded with jerry cans of
water, relief parcels and firewood scrounged from the city's supply of
shell-blasted buildings.
As residents trudged down snowy lanes, Nato jets roared overhead taking
advantage of clearing skies for last-minute reconnaissance flights.

Mr Arkady Volsky, chief of a Russian industrialists' and entrepreneurs'
union, called at the weekend for western capital to support what he called
the new government's attempts to restore 'basic organisation' to the economy
in order to continue reforms.
Mr Volsky, a close associate of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
who has called for 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation and more state
intervention in the economy, denied Russia lacked the right political and
economic conditions to receive large-scale financial assistance.
He also called for 'international compensation' to Russia for 'billions of
dollars' it had lost because of its adherence to sanctions against the
former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya.
Mr Chernomyrdin has continued to issue conflicting signals about the
intentions of his new economic team of former industrial managers. 'They are
scared of being blamed for fuelling inflation. They do not know what to do.
They have made promises but no decisions,' said one reformer still in the
government.
On Friday, Mr Chernomyrdin signed a document bringing closer a controversial
monetary union with neighbouring Belarus. Although the terms of the proposed
union have yet to be made public, this project will inevitably mean
increased pressure on Russia's finances.
In an attempt to lessen the burden of neighbouring republics, Russia last
year cut energy supplies to the Commonwealth of Independent States by 40 per
cent for oil and 25 per cent for gas, according to official figures
published yesterday.
Mr Chernomyrdin also reassured Ukraine that Russia had no desire to take
back the Crimean peninsula after Crimea's new president, who has promised a
referendum on reunification with Russia, asked a former Russian deputy
premier to head his government.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Romania acts against pyramid craze: Branch closure hinders
efforts to keep money pouring in to controversial scheme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Romanian authorities have taken public measures against Caritas, the
money-spinning pyramid scheme, for the first time in its 22-month existence.
The scheme's branch at Snagov, outside Bucharest, was open for just eight
days before local authorities found a reason to close it last week. Caritas,
which at its peak last year attracted some Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) in
deposits from a total of 4m Romanians, did not have a legal lease on its
premises, they said.
The move foils a bid by Mr Ion Stoica, the head of Caritas, to keep money
coming into the scheme by opening new branches around the country.
Mr Stoica was forced to move further afield after investor confidence in the
Transylvanian town of Cluj, where he founded his 'society for mutual help',
evaporated when the scheme stopped making regular payments in the autumn.
Since then only a handful of the hundreds of thousands who were promised a
seven-fold return on their money in three months have received their
'winnings'.
Many have been left penniless after investing their life's savings in the
scheme in the hope of protecting themselves against annual inflation of 300
per cent and rising poverty.
Mr Stoica, on the other hand, is believed to have collected Dollars 100m in
commissions alone.
Press reports of poverty-stricken investors and warnings from President Ion
Iliescu have not been enough to kill off the Caritas craze.
Thousands of naive and desperate Romanians have continued to put cash into
new branches or in the many other similar schemes which have sprung up in
its wake.
At Snagov, some 5,600 investors sank the equivalent of Dollars 840,000 into
the Caritas branch within just four days of its opening, according to
company ledgers examined by financial police.
Many said depositing early would increase their chance of winning. 'I was
one of the first in Cluj and I won 500,000 lei (Pounds 231),' one factory
worker said. 'That's why I'm here again at the beginning.'
Others had lost money in Cluj but, spurred on by Mr Stoica's promise to
relaunch the scheme in Bucharest, now hoped to become winners.
Mr Stoica's promise was relayed to the country in a half-hour interview on
state-controlled television aired at prime time which would have cost
Dollars 20,000 if run as a commercial. Free advertising time is just one of
the many favours Mr Stoica has enjoyed on the way to amassing his fortune.
In Cluj, Caritas enjoyed the patronage of the mayor, Mr Gheorghe Funar, who
is also president of the Romanian parliament's largest nationalist party.
Caritas, which was given offices in the town's sports stadium, boomed after
Mr Funar endorsed it alongside Mr Stoica on television and at rallies.
'Donations' from the scheme paid for the mayor's grandiose public works
schemes.
Mr Funar's party is now negotiating with the ruling party to form a new
governing coalition. In recent weeks, local authorities in other towns have
closed down smaller rival pyramid schemes and arrested organisers on grounds
of fraud and embezzlement.
But Mr Stoica, who says he has a list of MPs and other senior officials who
have profited from Caritas, remains free.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Kozyrev warns east Europe about Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy prime minister and Moscow's special
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, brokers agreements in Sarajevo, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, travels around eastern Europe.
Fresh from long talks with Greek officials, who continue to prevent oil
deliveries reaching neighbouring Macedonia, Mr Kozyrev yesterday met Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, travels to Budapest today, and
arrives in Warsaw tomorrow.
The agenda is clear. The Russians want to explain Moscow's role in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. But they also want to tell Prague, Budapest and Warsaw
that Nato's Partnership for Peace could be jeopardised if Nato launches air
strikes on Sarajevo.
The Partnership for Peace envisages closer military co-operation, but no
eventual membership or any kind of security guarantee for the countries of
eastern Europe Against this background of growing Russian involvement in the
Bosnian crisis, military strategists believe that if the US does not play a
role in reaching a negotiated political settlement, a new balance of power
will emerge in Europe with Russia playing a more dominant role at the
expense of the east Europeans.
Czech President Vaclav Havel has repeatedly said the Bosnian war has exposed
Europe's inability to deal with the post-cold war era: the western response
may encourage future nationalists and populists in eastern Europe capable of
exploiting divisions among European capitals.
'Kozyrev will be told what the Czechs think,' a senior military strategist
said. 'Mr Klaus, who has no illusions about the European Union, will tell
Moscow that Prague will deal with Russia, but on its own terms.'
In Budapest, diplomats are very disappointed with Nato's stance on Bosnia.
'We allowed them to fly Awacs over our territory. Then they simply gave the
impression they expected us to allow them to fly Awacs over Hungary for the
air strikes without any kind of proper consultation. We refused,' a
Hungarian diplomat said. 'Yet when we ask for a decent Partnership for
Peace, the door is only half opened.'
Moscow may be grateful for Hungary's refusal. But Budapest had its own
motives: the fate of the 450,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority in Serbia.
'We would be pleased if Kozyrev could exert pressure on Serbia to recognise
the rights of the minority and ensure their safety,' the diplomat said. 'But
it should be the west which should shore up our democratic structures, while
Russia would probably want something in return if it helped us.' That might
involve Hungary's easing sanctions on Serbia, which Budapest would be loath
to concede.
Mr Kozyrev's trip to Warsaw will be even more delicate. The Poles have not
forgotten how President Boris Yeltsin last year said he opposed Poland
asking for Nato membership. 'Sometimes you think that Moscow does not
realise that we are an independent sovereign country,' a Polish Foreign
Ministry official said then.
Yet the Russian leadership, with Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the
far-right Russian Liberal Democratic party, in the background, realise that
the longer the west fails to live up to its promises and commitments for the
countries of eastern Europe, the greater the chance for feeding anti-western
sentiments within eastern Europe itself.
'We are extremely fortunate eastern Europe is stable, little thanks to us,'
a UK military expert said. 'The Bosnian crisis has shown eastern Europe the
weaknesses of western governments. They worry that if Washington does not
pull its weight in Bosnia, Russia could fill that vacuum, return to haunt
eastern Europe, and even turn the region into a cordon sanitaire. Remember,
Russia still has an imperial itch.'

FT  21 FEB 94 / Mirror group lifts bid for Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday increased its bid
for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and Independent on
Sunday, in an effort to gain a majority stake in the company.
The bid was raised from 261.6p to 350p a share, matching the sum paid
earlier this month by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland,
for 24.99 per cent of the company. The increased bid values Newspaper
Publishing at Pounds 73.65m.
The consortium controls nearly 48 per cent of Newspaper Publishing and hopes
the new offer will enable it to secure more than 50 per cent. Apart from
MGN, the consortium includes Newspaper Publishing's two largest existing
shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, and a group which
founded the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor in chief.
Newspaper Publishing said yesterday a committee of the board made up of
independent directors would discuss the improved bid today and there would
be a full board meeting on Thursday.
The consortium hoped the offer would be recommended 'with a view to ending
as soon as possible the present damaging uncertainty about the company's
future'. It said the independent directors had indicated the price was
acceptable. However it said its offer would be formally rejected because it
would not undertake to maintain the offer, on the same terms, in the event
of the bid being referred to, and cleared by, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is considering a
request from the consortium that it should be allowed to acquire a
controlling interest without an MMC inquiry. He could agree to this if he is
satisfied the newspapers are not economic as a going concern; he has set a
deadline of March 3 for comment on the proposal.
Mr O'Reilly could now attempt to increase his stake beyond 24.99 per cent -
25 per cent is the trigger for an MMC referral - on the grounds that an
inquiry is now, in any case, under consideration.
It is understood Mr O'Reilly has been told by the independent directors the
consortium bid will ultimately succeed if he fails to make a full bid.
Merely raising his stake to 30 per cent would not solve the company's
problems long term, he has been told.
The National Union of Journalists' branch at the newspapers said it could
still not support the MGN consortium bid because of the 'likely loss of up
to 250 jobs and the destruction of editorial independence'.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Postal workers reject productivity deal: Union fears Royal
Mail may now impose changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's postal workers have decisively rejected a national productivity
plan to improve the Royal Mail's efficiency and make it more commercial in
preparation for its eventual privatisation.
In a secret postal ballot they voted against the deal, against the advice of
their union, the Union of Communication Workers.
Only 33,194 supported the productivity plan, while 37,667 rejected it. A
total of 71,444 union members out of 128,874 returned completed ballot
papers.
Union leaders, deeply embarrassed by the rejection, are today due to meet
Royal Mail executives to discuss what they can do next. Mr Alan Johnson, the
UCW's general secretary, said yesterday: 'We need a period of calm
reflection.'
At national level, the UCW leadership has been working very closely with the
Post Office to make the organisation more commercial. The union's national
leadership has been willing to co-operate with the introduction of more
flexible working practices in sorting offices and mail delivery. The
productivity deal would have created a framework for local deals to
introduce more flexible shift patterns and working practices in sorting
offices.
In the aftermath of the unexpected defeat, union officials fear the Royal
Mail management may impose changes without union consent, in breach of
national agreements with the UCW. This could involve the unilateral
withdrawal by management of a number of interim productivity agreements
which came into force six years ago. UCW leaders are concerned that as a
result of the deal's defeat the Royal Mail will also refuse to negotiate any
further on the introduction of a shorter working week.
Mr Johnson said initial reports from the union's branches around the country
suggested many postal workers had found the proposed productivity scheme
'too complicated and half-baked'. The UCW hopes more talks can improve the
deal to make it more attractive.
Under the negotiated deal that was rejected, nearly half the postal workers
would have benefited financially from an increase in minimum pay rates. On
top of the basic 1.5 per cent pay rise, they would have received a further
1.5 to 1.6 per cent by agreeing to the productivity changes.
This would have ensured that the lowest paid workers in the Royal Mail
received an increase in their basic pay of twice the current rate of
inflation.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Nato lifts threat of early air strikes: UN finds substantial
withdrawal of Serb guns - West warns ultimatum remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tension over Bosnia eased early today as the United Nations said Nato air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo were unnecessary 'at this
stage'.
But western officials warned that the threat of air strikes remained unless
the Serbs continued to observe the Nato ultimatum issued earlier this month.
Soon after the deadline for ending the Serb artillery siege of the Bosnian
capital expired at midnight, the UN said there had been substantial
withdrawal or regrouping of the Serb heavy weapons.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia, said: 'On the
basis of the information available to me, and pending further verification,
I have decided that it is not necessary at this stage for me to request Nato
to use air power.'
In Washington, the White House said all Bosnian Serb heavy guns around
Sarajevo had been neutralised 'or soon should be'. As a result, UN and Nato
commanders had concluded no air strikes were necessary 'at this time', a
senior official said.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there had been effective
compliance with the Nato demand to remove heavy weapons more than 20km from
Sarajevo or put them under UN control under pain of air strikes. 'Nato's
resolve to end the shelling of Sarajevo does not end today,' he added. 'We
shall continue to verify compliance. . . We will remain vigilant.'
The military threat receded after the Nato alliance had assembled in Italy
and the Adriatic Sea the largest forces of air power since the Gulf war.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday urged Nato to go ahead with air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. It accused the UN of conniving with the
Serbs to avert air strikes.
In a bid to reassure the Moslems, General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander
in Bosnia, warned that if there were any breaches of the Nato ultimatum, 'I
will have no hesitation in calling air strikes'.
In relaxed remarks before the deadline, Gen Rose appeared concerned to
defuse tension. Asked where he would be at the midnight deadline, he told
reporters: 'In bed.'
Pentagon officials said that poor weather made it difficult to determine
immediately how many guns might still be within 20km of Sarajevo. Air
strikes were unlikely to be ordered before a complete assessment could be
made in the daylight today, they added.
But US officials warned that the Nato ultimatum was open-ended, and that air
strikes could be launched at any time if the Serbs did not continue to
comply. They also said western allies would this week discuss expanding the
Sarajevo ultimatum to ease the plight of other besieged Bosnian cities.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the 'next step is to
consider whether other places in Bosnia should have a comparable treatment',
including the towns of Srbrenica and Gorazde.
Shortly before the midnight deadline, 400 Russian UN peacekeeping troops
moved into Sarajevo to act as a buffer between Moslem-led forces in the
capital and the Serbs who have been besieging the city for 22 months. The
soldiers, in a convoy of 70 armoured vehicles, trucks and jeeps, were moved
from Croatia and will be followed by another 400 men from Russia.
Mr Worner thanked Russia for its role in Bosnia in the past few days, when
it lent its weight to secure Bosnian Serb agreement to withdraw heavy
weapons. 'The just and lasting peace that we must now try to achieve in
Bosnia involves close Russian involvement,' he added. 'We all must try to
maintain the momentum and reflect on further steps.'
President Bill Clinton phoned Russian president Boris Yeltsin yesterday and
told him he was encouraged by Serb efforts to comply with the Nato
ultimatum, a US official said.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister and Moscow's special
envoy in former Yugoslavia, warned earlier that Nato's Partnership for Peace
agreements with former Warsaw Pact states in eastern Europe could be one
casualty of any air strike. 'The point here is not air strikes; it is
peace,' he said.
As the west seeks ways to capitalise on the ceasefire around Sarajevo and
move the peace process forward, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary,
will today hold talks with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart. Senior
officials from the European Union, the US, Russia and the UN are due to meet
tomorrow in Bonn.
Mr Christopher said that finding a settlement which met the reasonable
requirements of the Bosnian Moslems was a high priority, and that the
apparent success of Nato's new resolve over Sarajevo would boost peace
talks.
Removal of the Serb artillery eases but does not end the siege of Sarajevo
and its 380,000 inhabitants. Serb forces still control all access to the
city, although UN troops are monitoring the latest ceasefire, which has
restored some degree of normality.

FT  21 FEB 94 / Financial markets braced for further turbulence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International financial markets look set for another bout of turbulence
today after the sell-off that caused heavy falls in US and European bond and
equity markets late last Friday.
One senior marketmaker in UK equities said yesterday that the FT-SE 100, the
London market's leading stocks, could probably be marked down by as much as
60 points at the opening to try to head off any attempted selling by the big
institutions.
He said that 3,355 on the FT-SE 100 would be a benchmark for market
sentiment: 'If it closes above 3,355 we should stabilise.' The FT-SE 100
closed at 3,382.6 last Friday. Wall Street is closed today - Presidents'
Day.
Last week's sell-off came as bond dealers took fright at talk of
exceptionally heavy selling of international bonds by some big US hedge
funds, which are involved in aggressive short-term trading but seek to
offset exposure to changes in market rates. This was compounded by worries
about what Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, will say to
Congress tomorrow in a review of monetary policy.
Asian centres will provide the first pointers to international market
performance today. In Tokyo, shares edged lower in thin morning trading,
with the Nikkei average down 18 at midday. Hong Kong stocks were sharply
down in early trade.
Mr Nick Knight, analyst at Nomura, the stockbroker, said: 'The Hong Kong
market is a critical and sensitive indicator of US money flows. If Hong Kong
is down 200 points we'll have a manageable fall in London but if it is
significantly larger than that, then it could be serious.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Civil service fast-stream entry system reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is reviewing one of the cornerstones of the British civil
service, the fast-stream entry system that assures a glittering career for
an elite of young high-flyers.
The Cabinet Office said yesterday that the review 'would look at the
strategic question of whether the civil service needs a fast-stream system
at all'.
For nearly 140 years the fast stream has picked out a small group of civil
servants at the start of their careers and virtually ensured that they are
Whitehall mandarins about 20 years later.
The system has been regularly attacked for ensuring that the civil service
is run by a like-minded group of white, middle-class males educated at
Oxford and Cambridge universities.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said in a parliamentary
written answer that the review would be completed by June.
The review follows calls from inside and outside Whitehall for changes to
the top structure of the civil service to bring it into line with the
management reforms of the past six years.
The creation of executive agencies to deliver central government services
has led ministers to look for private-sector skills in those who run them.
A recent Whitehall report into career management said that the fast-stream
system 'could encourage the worst aspects of elitism and, without care,
might perpetuate a set of skills more suitable to the past than the future'.
Mr John Garrett, Labour MP for Norwich South and a former member of the
Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said the announcement was the
first time ministers had admitted that the system needed changing.
'A crack has appeared in the facade,' he added. He said that civil service
reforms could have a big impact on elite career management in the private
sector.
Cabinet Office staff were more reserved about the announcement. An official
said: 'It shows we are a good, sensible employer, and this is a regular
review of whether our recruitment is up to best practice.'
The fast-stream system is administered by Recruitment and Assessment
Services, on behalf of the Civil Service Commissioners.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never have I felt so glad to return to London as I did last weekend. Good
old England; praise God for Naffshire. How snug things seemed. Comforting.
Familiar. A government of tired incompetents lecturing an electorate of
(mainly) idiots on how to comport themselves. Another Tory scandal.
Decrepitude. Banality.
I am a surprisingly simple soul: always highly amiable, a boon in office or
home. But I was in such a depressed state when I returned from Delhi last
weekend that I almost fell to the ground at Heathrow and kissed Naffshire's
sod, so pleased was I to be back.
I had not been to India before. I was there only briefly. But I was outraged
by what I saw - filth, pollution and poverty on a scale hard to stomach;
people milling wretchedly; the degradation of humanity on an eye-popping
scale.
I had to keep rubbing my eyes, for India seemed a parody of a country, so
unreal, so far off-course, that I felt I had strayed into a time-kink from
the middle of the next century, when population pressures will be exacting a
dreadful price for our inability to control our breeding.
By coincidence I was reading, while in Delhi, Aldous Huxley's Brave New
World Revisited. It was published in 1959, as Huxley's second opinion on the
phantasmagoric prophesies contained in his novel, Brave New World, written
in 1931.
I would guess that for every 1,000 who have read Brave New World, only a
handful have read Brave New World Revisited. You should try it, especially
if you have just handed a small boy, only five or six years old, one of
India's Untouchables, a few rupees in a Delhi street and have watched his
scabbed little face light up with a smile of disbelief.
Huxley was much exercised by over-population. This was not the space age but
the age of over-population. In the Brave New World of his fable, he wrote,
the problem of human numbers in relation to natural resources had been
effectively solved. But in the real world the problem was 'becoming graver
and more formidable with every passing year. It is against this grim
biological background that all the political, economic, cultural and
psychological dramas of our time are being played out.'
That quote is from the first chapter of Brave New World Revisited. It is in
the second chapter that Huxley really let rip, and he did so by venturing
into areas that are simply not discussed today.
In his Brave New World, he said, eugenics and dysgenics were practised
systematically: Betas, Alphas and even Alpha-pluses out of one set of
laboratory bottles; biologically inferior, almost sub-human, creatures from
another set.
In the real world, we did nothing systematic about our breeding. 'But in our
random and unregulated way we are not only over-populating our planet, we
are also, it would seem, making sure that these greater numbers shall be of
biologically poorer quality . . . Under the conditions now prevailing, every
advance in medicine will tend to be offset by a corresponding advance in the
survival rates of individuals cursed by some genetic insufficiency.'
Result: no improvement, or perhaps a deterioration, in average health
standards, and perhaps a decline in average intelligence. Going further,
Huxley quoted a Dr WH Sheldon as claiming that it was 'the fashion in some
academic circles to assure students that the alarm over differential
birth-rates is unfounded; that these problems are merely economic, or merely
educational, or merely religious, or merely cultural or something . . . This
is Pollyanna optimism. Reproductive delinquency is biological and basic.'
What chilled me especially as I stared through the windows of my tourist
coach in Delhi was Huxley's conclusion. 'What,' he asked, 'about the
congenitally insufficient organisms, whom our medicine and our social
services now preserve so that they may propagate their kind? . . . the
wholesale transmission to our descendants of the results of unfavourable
mutations, and the progressive contamination of the genetic pool from which
members of our species will have to draw, (is) obviously bad.'
Huxley didn't have any answers. But at least he asked the questions. Where
have those questions gone? Why have they been purged? Why the great silence?
I believe I know the answer. I think we have grown afraid. The thing that is
frightening us most is the sight of our own teeming shadows.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Private vices and publication: The fashion for posthumous
attacks on public figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The debunking biography is high fashion. Publishers now love nothing more
than a book which will prove that cherished public idols have not only feet
of clay, but are brittle through and through. Or rather, were brittle. Such
biographies could never survive the English laws on defamation, were it not
for the fact that dead men cannot sue.
This week Sir Stephen Spender, happily still with us, managed, through legal
action, to cause the pulping of an ostensible work of fiction which appeared
to be based on alleged homosexual relationships in his youth. But it must
irk Sir Stephen that he cannot guarantee his posthumous reputation. I am
prepared to bet that the temporarily stymied publisher of the fiction will
gleefully reprint the book immediately upon the poet's death, with a slogan
such as 'The book Sir Stephen Spender banned]'
This week two further examples of the genre have been serialised in the
newspapers. One is Roald Dahl, by Jeremy Treglown, to be published by Faber
and Faber in March. The other is John Arlott, a Memoir, by Timothy Arlott,
published by Andre Deutsch next Tuesday. Dahl, whose books for children give
more pleasure to their young readers than almost any other such writer since
the days of the Brothers Grimm, is portrayed by Jeremy Treglown as selfish,
ruthless and heartless.
In one episode Dahl is said to have fed his daughter a sleeping pill,
apparently so that he would be safe to have a telephone conversation with
one of his mistresses. Unfortunately for Dahl, the potion did not take
effect, his daughter overheard the conversation, and challenged her father.
The author, according to his biographer then addressed his daughter thus:
'You've always been trouble, you've always been a nosy little bitch. I want
you to get out of this house now.'
I am certainly not going to fault Treglown's research, still less his
motives. But will Willy Wonka's chocolate factory ever seem the same? At the
least, the product might taste a little more bitter.
The case of the Arlott biography is more poignant. The subject was one of
Britain's best loved broadcasters. His reputation was of a kind gentle and
generous man. The author who manages to drill a few holes in this picture is
John Arlott's son. Tim Arlott gives credit to his father where he believes
credit is due, but is ruthlessly honest about the great cricket
commentator's late years, describing him as: 'a selfish, demanding, limited
and impossible old man.'
I suspect that the majority of men become selfish, demanding and impossible
in their old age, unless they have managed to do so earlier. But some of the
stories that Timothy tells about his father are chilling nonetheless.
Perhaps there are some who will read Arlott junior's book and not be able to
recall the old boy's wonderfully generous commentaries. But I imagine that
for most of us, the revelations will seem insignificant compared to the
pleasure we gained from the outward manifestation of John Arlott's
character. Above all, none of it means that he was one whit a lesser man as
a professional; he managed never to inflict the darker side of his character
on to the public who adored him.
While I am sure that this will be the common reaction to young Arlott's
revelations, it is strange that such licence is not now being given to our
politicians. Most people seem to believe that Stephen Milligan's strange and
entirely solitary sexual practices would have rendered him unsuitable for
high office. Few people have said that it is an absurdity beyond measure
that another Conservative MP should have felt compelled to resign junior
office because he sent love poems to an assistant.
If we approved of what a politician did before we knew of his private vices,
we should continue to vote for him and his policies. If we did not like his
policies then we should never give our support, no matter how saintly his
private life. As has been said before, civilised society cannot survive
without a certain amount of hypocrisy.
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Private View: Sibyl of an age of anxiety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liz Greene, a Jungian psychotherapist, talks about the age of Aquarius
She was poised, a beautiful sibyl, under her own painting of a church hewn
from the rock in old Cappadocia. Her dark feline eyes were highlighted with
ochre, and there were long scratches on her bare forearms. Two fluffy
Burmese cats skidded about the floor.
In the centre of the contemporary-elegant room stood a bust of the emperor
Hadrian. Dionysiac masks grinned from the walls. Cretan snake-goddesses and
steatopygous figurines adorned the mantelpiece; a three-eyed Mexican cat
with human paws guarded the fireplace. We were in the house of Liz Greene,
doctor of psychology, Jungian analyst and scholar of astrology.
Dr Greene had been hesitant about this visit. Now she sat, quiet and
composed, on the edge of the sofa, occasionally leaning forward to light
another cigarette.
I asked her: Is the world suffering from Pre-Millennial Tension?
'Yes, certainly. But I call it collective anxiety. There is certainly an
enormous amount of it around.'
What is the anxiety about?
'I think you can only partly explain it by millennial fantasies - we have
very funny ideas about millennia. I think it is deeper than that. There are,
it seems to me, very profound changes taking place in people's perception of
reality.'
World-views, she said, had a finite span. 'And the world-view which we have
been relying on, the scientific world view, is showing serious signs of
wear.'
Why should we notice that?
'We still have a collective psyche. We are still plugged into, if you like,
a unified life which I think all human beings share. There is something
which connects us. It lies behind mass movements and the appearance, for
example, of the same mythologies in different parts of the world.'
Meanwhile, the 2,000-year-old moral fabric of Christianity was 'falling to
bits'.
Liz Greene speaks slowly and softly, like a sleepwalker, in a gentle
American accent acquired from a childhood in New Jersey. She went to
university in Boston and Los Angeles then, having an English father and
feeling culturally European, moved to England 20 years ago.
Was this pressure for change coming from humanity or from some cosmic or
divine force? They could not be separated, she replied. Psychology might use
neutral language 'but I don't see a lot of difference between what Jung
called 'the collective unconscious' and what religion calls God.'
Scientific knowledge prevented us from going back to the ancient world of
myth. We had lost something en route. 'You see a tremendous reaching out for
answers. People are desperate for something that will make the anxiety go
away.'
So they come to psychotherapists?
'They come to us, to astrologers, to priests, to fundamentalist religion, to
political ideology - they come to isms.'
Collective anxiety and cosmic pressure might just be inventions of the
psychiatric industry, I said: if not Pre-Millennial Tension, then
Post-Copernican Depression.
'That's an attitude one can take,' she said. 'I don't think it helps a lot.
It's like blaming advertising for something becoming popular.'
I had read a feminist theory that collective anxiety is a men's crisis. Was
the gender war, if such it be, a symptom?
Greene said she understood the idea but did not subscribe to it. 'I think
it's a symptom of scapegoating, the most characteristic manifestation of
anxiety.' She mentioned Germany and the Jews. 'It's particularly ugly but
very human.' Talk of gender wars bred hatred and made the problem worse.
I pointed to the pagan images around her room and asked if the occult played
some part in her worldview.
'The objects are here because I like them. The images of ancient gods are
symbols, not actualities and are imaged beautifully. That's why I collect
them, not because they are altars at which I sacrifice black chickens.' She
smiled suddenly, her mouth describing a great V. 'It has nothing to do with
magic or witchcraft. I mean, astrology was never occult.'
As everyone ought to know, our equinoctial point is shifting out of Pisces
into Aquarius. The Age of Aquarius starts about now, give or take 50 to 70
years depending on which star you pick.
Astrological shifts coincide with changes in religious beliefs, attitudes
and values, Greene said. Aquarius, being a collective type of sign, is
appropriate for conglomerate activity such as the European Union,
multinational companies, even superstores.
Are you saying there is a causal connection?
'No. I don't think that we are being made to do anything because it's the
Age of Aquarius. There isn't an 'out there' and an 'in here'. They're part
of the same thing. So planetary patterns do seem to synchronise with changes
that take place in individuals and collectives.'
She said there was a Uranus-Pluto conjunction, portending upheaval, in the
1960s. People may have been demonstrating in Paris, I objected, but what
upheavals were there in Indonesia or among Eskimos?
'I am not a world historian. You would expect to find something happening
but it would only happen within the structure that Indonesians or Eskimos
built.'
Orthodox scientists scream bloody murder about this kind of thing.
'That's their problem, not mine.' Now she actually laughed.
Liz Greene can afford to laugh. Probably half the world, including Ronald
Reagan, consults horoscopes. Nor are all modern scientists hostile. The
French researcher Michel Gauquelin is reported to have found compelling
statistical evidence of zodiacal congruity among individuals.
Does it matter how it works?
'Of course I would like to know, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.'
Do you expect the link to be discovered one day?
'Yes, I think it will. But I suspect it's going to require an opening up of
the scientific frame of reference for measurement.'
Liz Greene sometimes uses astrology to help her identify the probable crisis
points in her patients' lives. I asked if she was not worried she would
impose her unorthodox beliefs on vulnerable clients.
'Of course I'm concerned with that. I think any intelligent therapist is.'
That was why responsible analysts underwent analysis.
It may be just another symptom of our anxious transition to Aquarius that
psychotherapy has come in for a lot of stick. Therapists have been accused
of feeding off their clients, encouraging selfishness, even breaking up
families. I asked Liz Greene if she was aware of it.
'Well, I'm aware of Fay Weldon.' She laughed again. Weldon is bringing out a
novel, Affliction, based on the story of her husband's defection to a female
analyst. Greene was not sympathetic. 'He probably had a great many other
reasons for going. I think he heard what he'd been waiting to hear.'
Nor did people go to analysts casually, except perhaps in the Woody Allen
world, she said. It was too expensive for that, both emotionally and
financially.
How far should one person poke inside the personality of another?
'As much as the person needs. But I think the psyche limits itself. I think
we all have a kind of inner sanity which tells us when something is not
functioning properly and when it's OK.'
Is not introspection an unhealthy substitute for what used to be extrovert
worship of some deity?
'I don't think it's a substitute and I certainly wouldn't call it unhealthy.
But as we can no longer find God 'out there' it's not a bad idea to find
something like it inside, to discover some kind of inner morality or
integrity or ideal which is worth living for.'
Beneath the inner distress, she said, was something 'more intelligent than
the person is on the conscious level'.
What we used to call 'the soul'?
'Yes, if you like.'
Is psychotherapy a voyage of self-discovery for you as well?
'Certainly. I find people quite miraculous. My sense of - if you like - the
'soul' keeps getting reaffirmed every time I work with someone. You see
something mysterious and remarkable coming alive in them.'
Liz Greene studied stage and costume design but found the actors more
interesting than the plays. She also suffered a crisis at university and
problems with relationships. She would not tell me more.
I asked for her star sign. It is Virgo.
So your account of the world is one that suits your temperament?
'Of course it suits me or I wouldn't espouse it.'
You don't claim any more for it than that?
'I could be wrong.'
About the collective anxiety?
'I could be wrong about all of it. I can only tell you what I have observed.
I draw the conclusions that fit my frame of reference.
'Whether it's absolute truth I haven't the foggiest idea. But it is a very
rich and meaningful frame of reference, not only to me but has been for
4,000 years to minds far better equipped than mine. I'm in good company.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / The old Italian way to pacify Ireland: Max Wilkinson
considers a 16th century solution to the long-running conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I dreamed a dream of how to end the killing in Northern Ireland. No matter.
John Major is also sleepwalking: uncertain from one day to the next whether
he is talking to the bosses of the terrorists. And Gerry Adams is far away
in the land of nod if he thinks that easy victories on American TV can
sanctify murder or disguise the growing ascendancy of protestant gunmen.
Let us hope that both are dancing to a tune we cannot hear and that Ireland
will one day awaken to its harmony. Meanwhile, here is a different dream. It
begins with the ghost of Machiavelli, asking briskly: 'Why do you English
stay in Northern Ireland: for profit, sentiment, for glory or because you
fear the contagion of a religious war? Which side do you support? If
neither, why do you give them both money?' The spirit of that prince of
civil servants began to fade.
'Stay,' I cried. 'Everyone except our government knows that these are the
right questions. But how shall we answer?' He returned into focus, with the
sardonic smile which so irritated Lorenzo de' Medici.
'I have written,' he replied, 'That a foreign power cannot succeed by
generosity alone; for the people's gratitude is fickle. A liberal rule must
be tempered by severity. Hannibal, for example, avoided insurrection because
his fine qualities included extreme brutality . . .'
'No doubt, no doubt' I said, 'But we abandoned even the mildest torture
decades ago after The Sunday Times discovered that prisoners were being made
to stand against a wall . . .Yes, we have tried locking up all suspects,
including the innocent. But as you said in 1513, that sort of thing foments
unrest.'
'And you no longer exact tribute from their lands,' he mused.
'No,' I replied. 'English settlers were once rapacious. There was hunger and
oppression. But now the province is part of our kingdom, just like Kent or
Wales. The people there get the same benefits as in Great Britain even
though they generate less wealth.'
'So you must pay . . '
'Yes, Pounds 3,200m a year, plus another Pounds 400m for an army to stop
them killing each other. That is about Pounds 43 a week per head.'
Machiavelli looked puzzled, so I explained: 'We give every person in
Northern Ireland the equivalent of a 20kg sack of silver each year.'
His lip curled: 'You are much loved for this?'
'No. Powerful Americans believe the Irish are still enslaved and send them
money for explosives. The Irish think state benefits are theirs by right (as
people do in England). The protestants fear we will take away their
privileges, and the catholics grumble because so many cannot find work.
'You pay them even if they do not work?'
'Of course. Especially if they do not work.'
'Including the terrorists?'
'Perhaps, if they have no work.'
'Few successful rulers have paid rebels who kill their own soldiers,' he
said.
'But we are a democracy.'
'Nevertheless, your rulers must force both sides to understand how much is
being paid and exact conditions for the money. This cannot be done, you
agree, so long as Northern Ireland is treated like your Kent. Perhaps the
province could be given a kind of independence. The protestants should then
be warned that the grant will be cut unless they behave, and the catholics
would see that if they were to join the Republic they would be very much
poorer.'
'We tried this.'
'You must be more ruthless. And this time get rid of the terrorists. Kill or
imprison all that you prudently can. Bribe the rest. Give very large bribes
to the leaders; then they will control their comrades and inform on any who
break ranks. This will be much cheaper than paying Pounds 400m to your
soldiers. Of course these payments must be disguised: perhaps as a
rehabilitation fund run by Norwegians.'
'But this is totally unacceptable.'
'Then keep your dreams,' he said and faded into the dawn.

THE PAN PRINCIPLE by Fiona Pitt-Kethley
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 16.99, 315 pages
A DRY SHIP TO THE MOUNTAINS by Daniel Farson Michael Joseph Pounds 15.99,
246 pages
Her Baedeker in hand and her knickers round her ankles, Fiona Pitt-Kethley
travelled to Greece to research the god Pan and the places where he was
worshipped. Not a bad idea. Probably worth a travel book. Start in Arcadia,
Pan's undisputed birthplace, and carry on from there. Temples and
mountain-tops, ceremonies in sordid caves. How extremely jolly. A bit of
ancient sex, too, which could hardly harm one's sales.
But be warned: The Pan Principle is not a book for an elderly aunt about to
embark on a Swan Hellenic cruise of Greece and her islands, for it is
stuffed with sex - modern sex, always with strangers, sometimes satisfactory
yet sometimes, as in life, grubbily inorgasmic. The reason for this is that
Ms Pitt-Kethley, excessively fond of a bonk, has sauced the tale of her
journeyings with kiss-and-tell accounts of all the sexual rompings she
enjoyed along the way.
Nothing wrong with that, of course. She is not a pornographer. She just has
these needs, and is a fastidious reporter - describing, for example, with
detachment and insouciance, which colour condom she chose for which Greek
member.
And it is refreshing, at least initially, to encounter someone not prepared
to don the wan garb of the average travel writer - sick-making lyricism,
dishonest romanticism and egregious selectivity. Nine-tenths of this planet
is in a god-awful mess, but you would never guess it from most travel books.
At least Pitt-Kethley is honest. But the mind starts to wander as she
grapples with yet another native. First there is Spiros the accountant, with
whom she groans and sags in a pied-a-terre in Pyrgos. Spiros has his own
condoms, a brand called STOP, and, being an accountant, is so extremely
cautious that he uses a rubber band to hold the thing in place.
Next is Giovanni, an attractive museum guard with whom Pitt-Kethley couples
on the marble floor of the archaeological museum in Naples during one of her
trips home. (Do not bother to try it: it proved excessively painful.) Then
Nick, a physics lecturer; Demetrios, all foreplay; Georgios the biker, who
bites her, rather thuggishly. And so on and so forth.
A few stray males escape Pitt-Kethley's clasp, including two boys, hardly
old enough to be driving, who pick her up in a van between Stamata and
Marathon. They are soon all over her, but they do not get a jump - mainly,
she tells us primly, because she cannot stomach acne.
Occasionally, Pitt-Kethley offers us an anthropological insight. 'In Greece,
as in England,' she confides, 'the men are predominantly homosexual by
inclination.' And although there are plenty of good-looking men in Athens
and elsewhere, there is something wrong with Greek male bodies. Greek men
hate to walk, she says; they drive everywhere, which atrophies their legs.
She is equally sharp on Greek pollution, which is 'slowly but surely
damaging every outdoor work of art.' And sharp, too, on Greek officialdom.
In Delphi's tourist office she encounters a woman who is remarkably
proficient at not giving information in several languages, which leads the
author to observe that she has never yet heard any expression of regret for
Greek ignorance voiced by a Greek.
What with all the sex, Pitt-Kethley's search for the ithyphallic Pan, the
master of diverse roles, who was revived, in Edwardian times, as a figure
representing raw sex and the subconscious in all its power, is often lost
sight of, though she has her moments as a travel writer, not least when
describing the people of the tiny village of Ano Karyes, on Mount Lykaion,
one of the most beautiful and mysterious of Greek mountains, from the top of
which you can see all the mountain ranges of the Peloponnese.
Twenty years ago, unknown to most of the world, the people of Ano Karyes
decided to restart the Lykaian Games, which had a pedigree almost as
honourable as that of the Olympic Games. There are only 27 people left
living in Ano Karyes, but their passion for conservation is so inspiring,
says Pitt-Kethley, that since meeting them she has often wished they were
running the whole country.
In a ruminative finale, Pitt-Kethley concludes that Pan is dead in most of
Greece - dead of pollution and the self-created problems in which Greece
wallows. But she adds, not convincingly, that he is alive elsewhere, at
least for the time being.
After the exuberance and knowingness of Pitt-Kethley, Daniel Farson's A Dry
Ship to the Mountains sits tamely in the hand. Farson sets out to complete
his father's 1929 attempt to cross the Klukhor pass in the Caucasus on
horseback. At the age of 64, this great-nephew of Bram Stoker imagined he
would take a jolly cruise down the Volga and then an idyllic ride across the
mountains. That is not how things turned out.
He writes fairly charmingly. Trouble is, I read him immediately after
rolling with Pitt-Kethley. Every time Farson met a new male character, I at
once started wondering how he would rate in bed. The suspense was all but
fatal.

<TEXT>
THE RENAISSANCE PRINT by David Landau and Peter Parshall
Yale University Press
Pounds 45, 433 pages
The Renaissance print, north and south of the Alps, has largely been taken
for granted by art historians unless, as with Mantegna's engravings and
Durer's woodcuts, it is a significant part of an artist's oeuvre and
necessary to the completion of a monograph. Few have ever considered it as
art in its own right, both woven into painting and drawing, and standing
apart from them; nor have they enquired into its mass manufacture and
marketing, nor the artists to whom its technical development was a matter of
ardent intellectual and aesthetic concern.
David Landau, editor of Print Quarterly, and Peter Parshall, Professor of
art history at Portland, Oregon, have sought to remedy this, and with ten
years research have produced a book that covers the subject for a century or
so, from the print's first burgeoning in Flanders in the 1460s, to its
exploitation for the mechanical reproduction of Raphael's imagery, and from
the first crude woodblock to the elegant chiaroscuros of Ugo da Carpi and
Beccafumi.
Their approach is encyclopedic; we learn of the expanding manufacture of
paper from flax, as the market for wool declined and that for linen grew; we
learn of paper merchants at a Frankfurt fair, of inks from vine yeast or
burnt pitch, of printing presses established all along the Rhine and into
the Netherlands and Swabia, of family workshops in which wives and daughters
played their part and the works of other printmakers were sold, of networks
and of agents, and of Hungary as a source of copper for the plates; we are
even told of the use of prints as objects of portable and private devotion,
and of their enjoyment in privacy when the market proliferated into erotica
and pornography, not just in illustrating the illicit loves of gods, but
more directly - and the authors make their point with Raimondi's print of a
nude woman at pleasure with a ladies' comforter.
It is at an engaging pace at the beginning that we absorb the exciting basic
facts and glimpse Renaissance Europe feverishly exploiting a new commerce so
important to their prestige that such artists as Lucas Cranach and Urs Graf
may have been driven to falsify the dates of their prints so as to lay claim
to primacy in technical invention, but the pace is not sustained. The
complexities of the material defy the continuous text with which the authors
bind it, and like 18th century connoisseurs who know all the facts and are
fecund with ideas, but cannot organise either into a logical format, they
lose their grasp, and on recovery insert the material almost at random.
From page 65, not under his own name, but with the heading The Development
of a Tonal System, we have six pages devoted to the vexed matter of
Mantegna's prints; a little more appears on page 100, and another five full
pages are hidden in the subsequent chapter devoted to Marcantonio Raimondi
and Raphael; yet in these three passages the explanation of Mantegna's
techniques is far from clear, nor is the question of authenticity
satisfactorily addressed. Durer provides an even more continuous leitmotiv,
running right through the book - very late we learn that he gave his prints
in barter and payment, even as tips, and are treated to a discussion of
their financial worth and even of the coins that he carried in his purse -
but nowhere in the list of contents is he mentioned (nor is Mantegna),
though his compatriots Altdorfer, the Hopfers and Lutzelburger are.
The list of contents is one of the book's worst offences; with a confusion
of typefaces erratic in their relation to the importance of the subject, a
meaningless mixture of capitals and lower case, and absurd crowding, it is
inadequate, misleading and damnably unhelpful, and the serious reader
intending to use the book for reference must first set to the task of making
his own list, with cross-references. An editor should have seen to this, and
he should also have shaken the authors by the scruff; too often they write
carelessly, their grammar slovenly - 'there are only a couple of his plates
known' is typical, and 'more importantly' and other confusions of adjective
and adverb are a common irritant. No editor should have allowed to pass into
print the fuzzy thinking of the brief paragraph on Marcantonio and
Parmigianino in which appear 'almost certainly,' 'most scholars now agree
that,' 'more probably,' 'it is not unlikely that,'/'This is not improbable,
and it is also possible that,' 'would have been,' 'conceivably,' and
'probably rehearsed.'
A decade of labour by two diligent scholars does not of itself result in a
good book, particularly when they cannot spell (martial for marshal), cannot
write with any style that eases the reader through their torrent of
material, and are so jack-in-the-box with its presentation. The design of
the book is a disgrace - with a rigid spine its pages never lie flat, and of
the twin columns of small print, the inner invariably slides into the
gutter; crudely patched with little illustrations, few pages are comfortable
to the eye; and the sub-headings that mark the text's crucial shifts from
north to south of the Alps are too small to be seen when rifling swiftly
through the pages, as one must.
All this is more than irksome, for so absorbing a survey of so wide a field,
learned, technical, perceptive, and full of sudden and illuminating
insights, must be regarded as the most important work on the subject for
many years - certainly within my lifetime - but it could have been so much
more immediately useful had its publishers insisted on its being, not some
four hundred pages to be read as literature (with some four hundred
illustrations), but a stout reference book. We shall all use it as a
reference book, and every time we do so, we shall curse the press that
printed it.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Books: Poet hobbled by passion - The work of Stephen
Spender, 85 this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOLPHINS by Stephen Spender Faber and Faber Pounds 12.99 (Pounds 5.99
paperback) 46 pages
This month, the great cultural monument that is Sir Stephen Spender will be
85 years of age. It is now more than 30 years since the death of Louis
MacNeice, 20 since the deaths of WH Auden and C. Day Lewis and 10 since that
of Christopher Isherwood. Spender, the last surviving member of that
much-memorialised generation of the 1930s, has survived them all - and he
continues to write and review regularly to this day.
The poetry, however, has come very slowly. His last full collection, The
Generous Days, was published in 1971; his Collected Poems of 1985, though
containing some new works (including notable elegies to MacNeice and Auden)
was largely a re-presentation - often drastically re-worked  - of older
material.
In 'Worldsworth', the best poem of his new collection, Dolphins, he records
his first brush with poetry. In 1916 the Spenders were obliged to leave
their home on the cliffs near Sheringham, Norfolk after two stray German
bombs fell nearby. The family decamped to a farmhouse near Lake Derwentwater
and it was there that Spender, then seven years old, heard his father
reading Wordsworth in the garden. The vocabulary and the cadences of
romanticism became a life-long passion and it is a passion that has both
enriched and hobbled his poetry.
'Worldsworth' is just one of several autobiographical poems in this short
collection. Another, 'Air Raid', captures a moment in 1941 when a bomb, that
'unreasoning fury from an enemy's vision of life', destroys the outer walls
of a house, turning what had once been private and inside - a bath, a
wardrobe, books, the telephone - into a public spectacle. All that "tender
sensitive life" has been thrown away.
Variants upon this observation are the over-riding theme of the collection,
no matter how widely it may seem to range in subject matter  - from memories
of the first and second world wars, through elegies for dead friends, to a
long poem which examines the explosive relationship between Rimbaud and
Verlaine. What can be preserved of the intensities of the inner life in a
world that seems hell bent on its own annihilation? The poet, according to
Spender, acts as a mediator between the uniquely private self and the world
outside us. There is a lived, shared reality which is both general to
everyone and unique to each person, and it is poetry's task to describe it.
Unfortunately Spender's abilities in this book are rarely equal to his
vision. 'Air Raid' collapses at the end into cliche and verbal redundancy;
many of the other poems seem too casually written, as if they are little
more than notebook jottings. Only in the Wordsworthian blank verse of
'Worldsworth' do we find a sustained and excellent piece of writing from
beginning to end.
Sir Stephen Spender, cultural ambassador plenipotentiary, the memorialiser
of himself and his famous generation, journalist, editor, essayist,
university teacher and literary critic seems to have spent so much time
clinking glasses across tables and lurching from glittering lunch to equally
glittering dinner (anyone who doubts this should read his Journals
1939-1983) that it is a wonder he has had the time - or the powers of
concentration - to write any good poetry at all. The fact is, of course,
that he has written a little. But most critics would agree that he has not
achieved his life-long ambition to be a great poet. His more enduring
achievements have been elsewhere: as a writer of prose, for example, (an
autobiography, World within World, is his masterpiece). Here he has found a
way with words that is much more subtle, flexible and assured than most of
his poetry ever manages to be, marred as it so often is by a peculiar
stiffness and Shelleyan rhetoric. As a spokesman for liberal values, no
matter how hopelessly privileged the spokesman may at times seem to be,
Spender has also made his mark: to argue for the sacredness of the
individual and his impulses is, after all, one of the finest fruits of the
romantic movement.

IN THE TRAIL OF ODYSSEUS by Marianna Koromila
Michael Russell Pounds 14.95, 150 pages
Patrick Leigh Fermor's services to our understanding and love of Greece
extend beyond his magnificent travel books. His translation of The Cretan
Runner, for instance - the war memoir of George Psychoundakis, one of Leigh
Fermor's irregulars during the German Occupation - gave us one of the most
fascinating books about Crete. Now he has introduced the English edition of
another memoir by an 'ordinary' Greek. Like The Cretan Runner, In the Trail
of Odysseus is a surprise and a delight.
It is the life story of Yiankos Danielopoulos, who was born in merchant
prosperity in a small port on the Black Sea in 1899 and died in contented
poverty 88 years later on his small farm on Mt Hymettos near Athens. Yiankos
apparently wrote a version of autobiography in old age, which was then put
together and skilfully placed in context by Marianna Koromila.
It has been fluently translated by Nigel Clive and Leigh Fermor contributes
an introduction in his inimitable style. ('On the right a beech-forest
wavered inland to the foothills of the Great Balkan Range, and on the left,
beyond a steep tumble of rocks and a troop of cormorants, a sweep of green
water fled away to the skyline. It was getting dark; light snow began
fluttering down and suddenly revelation came . . .')
The interest, and indeed the importance, of this book is that it calls from
the shadows the least-known members of the Greek diaspora - the three
million Greeks of the Black Sea, before the dramas of this century drove
most of them back home to the Mediterranean.
These Greeks (can we call them Thracians?) of the Danube Delta, the Crimea,
Odessa, the Caucasus, Rostov-on-the-Don, etc., have never enjoyed the
attention which has rightly been given to their compatriots in Egypt or Asia
Minor. Here at last we have a portrait of a vigorous and thriving society of
traders and sailors, a picture of a bygone age in which villagers dance on
red-hot coals at the Feast of St Panteleimon, the children are all sent off
by sailing boat to school in Constantinople, and drunken Cossacks drown in
the cellars they have flooded with looted wine.
But Yiankos' life was to be one of repeated crisis and disruption, as he
suffered - with remarkable ebullience - the consequences of the Balkan Wars,
the first world war, the 1917 Soviet Revolution and its aftermath, the 1929
Crash, the second world war, and Yalta. Again and again he built up a
business and a home, whether in Constanza or Galatz or Rostov or the Sea of
Azov or Novorosisk or Constanza (again) or Bucharest, only to lose it all
and have to move on.
He changed nationality twice and profession 13 times and he was seven times
a refugee. He was a money changer, he owned a cafe and then a grocery store,
he was director of a state confectionery shop in Romania, and he finished up
a farmer in Attica. He survived the Bulgarians and their 'ethnic cleansing'
of Thracians in 1914, the Anarchists in 1917, the Bolsheviks in 1924, the
Iron Guard in 1940, the Stalinists in 1948. He made friends with the German
invaders in 1940 and with their Soviet successors in 1945. Always he
observed the golden rule of Greeks abroad - keep out of local politics.
In the end, says Koromila, not too fancifully, he followed the guidance of
Tiresias to Odysseus - to take an oar and to travel inland to the point
where the oar is thought by the locals to be a spade, and there to make his
home. In 1950 Yiankos brought his family back to the Mediterranean, as
refugees.
All of this is engrossing, but I am a little worried about Koromila's
insistence that Homer specifically set The Odyssey in the Black Sea, with
the Sirens in the Sea of Marmara and Hades located in the Cimmerian
Bosphorus at the foot of the Caucasus. This is surely an absurdly literal
interpretation of a great poetic myth - and anyhow, Odysseus was aiming for
Ithaca, which lies in the other direction. Does this explain why this
otherwise splendid slim volume is disgracefully devoid of a proper map?

GAZA FIRST:
THE SECRET NORWAY CHANNEL TO PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PLO
by Jane Corbin Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 213 pages
Rarely is a journalist's coup quite so comprehensive as the one scored last
September by Jane Corbin. Within hours of Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, and Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, shaking hands on the lawn of the White House, Corbin's account
of the secret negotiations which led to the deal was being screened by BBC
Panorama.
She has now attempted to flesh out her inevitably rather impressionistic
account with a more detailed narrative. The format, however, is similar and
the book has the accelerating pace of a political thriller.
The cast of characters - the Norwegian expediters, the Israeli amateurs and
later the professionals, and the senior PLO figures - occupy centre stage.
Their personal chemistry, swings of emotion, suspicions, eating habits,
dress styles and largely successful attempts to avoid media attention are
minutely chronicled.
So Terje Rod Larsen ( 'dresses with casual insouciance') and Mona Juul
('something wild and mysterious about her') are the Norwegian 'golden
couple' at the heart of the negotiations who sometimes exchange
'surreptitious glances of dismay'. Abu Ala is 'the Palestinian banker,
though no terrorist himself', who flies into occasional rages and must
always be given the biggest bedroom, while Uri Savir, the leading Israeli
negotiator, on his second day in Norway wanders about in jeans and T-shirt
asking: 'Where am I? Who am I? What am I doing here?'.
There is rather less detail on the actual substance of the negotiations, in
part because the process is continuing, but also because of the ambiguity
required by both sides in order in order to clinch an agreement which could
be sold to their domestic constituencies. Mutual recognition by Israel and
the PLO, implicit since the Madrid conference in 1991, was the explicit
achievement of the Oslo agreement. All the really contentious issues, such
as the future of Israeli settlements, the status of Jerusalem, and the right
of Palestinian refugees to return to their own state, have been shelved.
The resolution of those problems will depend on people who did not benefit
from the unique atmosphere created at the Norway meetings. Arafat is now
back at the centre of world attention, but also subject to greater
international scrutiny, while the deeply cautious Rabin is juggling his
every word against the stability of his coalition government.
The sudden death last month of Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian foreign
minister, tragically illustrated the enormous physical and emotional strains
imposed on his small team. They emerge as the true heroes. The others have
yet to prove that they are as selflessly and courageously committed to a
just and lasting peace.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Picasso put in perspective - This week saw the opening
of one of the most memorable exhibitions ever mounted by the Tate Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been many exhibitions of the work of Picasso the sculptor - most
notably the pioneering study undertaken for the Arts Council by Roland
Penrose in 1967, with the active co-operation of Picasso himself, then 86.
That, too, was shown at the Tate. But between that and this present exercise
there lies a profound difference.
Picasso: Painter/Sculptor is the first exhibition of such scale and
definitive ambition to take as its subject not either aspect as a distinct,
if complementary, practice, but rather each as necessary to the other, each
feeding off the other and integral to the one, constant, creative activity.
Picasso turned to sculpture for the first time, so far as is known, around
1906, a moment of transition that saw him moving from the sweeter symbolism
of his early career, blue and rose, to something much more raw and radical.
Now, in these gently modelled heads of his mistress and companion of those
early years, Fernande Olivier, we see him quietly looking sideways at his
contemporaries, Rodin, Maillol, Brancusi and Matisse. We also clearly see in
the paintings and drawings around us that he is looking back to the radical
pictorial devices of Cezanne, and to the formal simplicity and energy of
primitive Iberian and tribal sculpture.
And yet he remains entirely himself. Already, with the Demoiselles
d'Avignon, that savage precursor of cubism, in gestation and the simple
monumental heads and figures spread all about us, his own formal resolution
of his several interests begins to declare itself in all its revolutionary
confidence and authority.
The work of this first room and period alone makes the point for the entire
exhibition, as we move from the early sculptural nudes and heads to the
first extraordinary essays into cubism. And for the first time the point is
made, and made forcibly, that cubism was not simply an exercise in reforming
and reworking the idea of rendering space and form on a plane surface.
Rather it is the essential, albeit mutually contradictory, interdependence
of the flat and the round, the real and the proposed, that is being explored
and celebrated.
By 1909 and the Head of a Woman (Fernande), with its faceted, disrupted,
almost pictorial surfaces that would yet flatten and deny its own undeniable
mass and physical presence, we have what is still one of the most remarkable
and truly revolutionary works of the century. To confront it is to be thrown
straight back to the cubist drawings and paintings to which it relates. And
they again, by the very mass and weight, space and light that they conjure
up on the flat surface, throw us back directly to the sculpture.
Picasso was not always engaged with sculpture through that long career, but
it is now clear that there was a sculptural potential or possibility in
whatever he did. Whenever he was directly so engaged, the sculpture he
produced was always keyed closely in to whatever else was in hand, used
directly to clarify the painterly preoccupation.
But to use the distinction 'painterly' at all is almost to mistake the
point, for it is rather the artist's preoccupation that was ever to be
clarified, indifferently in terms of paint or clay, ink or paper, pot or
plaster as appropriate.
Here are two late cubist still-lifes of 1914, a glass on a shelf, a knife, a
scrap of newsprint, a piece of cheese, a decorative border - only one is
cobbled together of wood and fabric all painted up, and its glass a flat
piece of wood, its wine a neat pictorial trick. Again, in 1919, a
still-life, guitar and mirror, is set up at an open window at Saint-Raphael,
and a maquette of folded paper devised as its actual subject.
So the game goes on down the years - inside and outside, the modelled form,
the flat illusion, the painted surface that bespeaks the form, the form that
confounds itself.
Still-life is perhaps the key to it, if we take the term in the broadest
sense: the model, the cat, the pots and flowers, all the paraphernalia and
detritus of studio practice, the accumulation of work against the wall,
half-finished, half-forgotten. And constantly the work itself is fed back
into the work, the work of art as its own still life, as familiar in paint
as in the round - the woman's head, goat's skull, bottle, guitar.
How various the man is. Picasso was born in 1881. He embarked upon his
cubist adventure before he was 30 and he continued active into the 1970s.
And yet there are still those who would deny the worth of his achievement,
who consider him no more than a skilful and mischievous fraud. No one would
deny Picasso the mischief, but fraud, never. Given such full retrospective
scope as now, the quality of his transforming imagination and his technical
mastery alike are manifest in everything he did, as clear in every touch of
paint on a surface as in every twist or fold of paper, or pinch of clay or
plaster. A natural painter, an instinctive sculptor, his standing as the
commanding artist of our century is obvious and inescapable.
This exhibition has been selected and introduced by Elizabeth Cowling and
John Golding, and beautifully judged and installed. They have produced one
of those rare shows, sure to live on long in the memory.
Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until May 8: sponsored by Ernst  Young.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Passion meets corruption and farce - Andrew St George
finds provincial theatre very much alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Leeds, there is a fine new Death of a Salesman; at Manchester a weak new
play called The Lodger, and at Birmingham a welcome revival of The Atheist's
Tragedy.
Arthur Miller began writing Salesman (1949) in a wood shack he built in
Connecticut. He called the first draft The Inside of His Head. The West
Yorkshire Playhouse has a fine production directed by Matthew Warchus which
catches the passion and the pose of Miller's original.
As employment in the 1990s becomes less secure, Willy Loman is back in
fashion: it is absurd to expect loyalty from an employer when money is the
real issue.
Ken Stott finds a way through the part of Loman making him admirable and
contemptible, stupid to think that good individual work will be valued by an
institution. His is a good performance, knotty on his own, yet pliable with
others. Ellie Haddington plays Linda superbly: strong, uncomplaining and
baffled by what is slowly killing her husband. A fine performance like this
shifts the play towards Linda, making it her story too.
Warchus uses an open set crossed by events from Loman's past which still
seem real and have an effect: inside his head is just right. The second half
is inside the house looking out, making the wide stage into an intimate
family space.
Further south, we reach the bedsit suburbs of The Lodger at The Royal
Exchange Theatre, Manchester. The play won the 1992 Mobil play writing
competition run by the Royal Exchange. It is written by Simon Burke, an
accomplished television writer. This play suits itself to the literary
prize: it has sex, drugs, police corruption and romance in committee-winning
equilibrium, wrapped in a producer-friendly small cast.
Detective Constable Wise has a mortgage to pay and a room to rent. He takes
in Lois, who uses the DC's back bedroom for immoral purposes. Then Lois's
pimp turns up from King's Cross, and they go back into business. Finally,
enter DC Reed, Wise's colleague, who discovers what the ironically named
Wise has failed to do: the truth about Lois. Domestic violence ensues.
The strongest aspect of the production is Julian McGowan's fine set. It lays
out the twilight bedsit world as a fluorescent ground plan, like the glowing
ruins of an old domestic settlement worn down to the foundations. The walls
light up as the action moves.
The two principals, Julia Ford (Lois) and Philip Jackson (Wise) conjure a
workable relationship from the script. In the programme Burke describes the
play as 'indeed nasty brutish and short'; good to have Burke on Hobbes, but
it should be more of all three.
Machiavelli is the philosopher of choice at Birmingham Rep's otiose
production of Cyril Tourneur's Atheist's Tragedy (c. 1606-11). This ripping
revenge horror is carried by the excellent Gerard Murphy as the scheming
D'Amville. This is an unusual play, bravely staged and worth seeing for
Murphy alone.
Seen as a whole, this piece of Jacobean horror runs of sophisticated lines;
watching it is like seeing a proof of Chaos Theory in the theatre where a
small event changes the whole picture.
The play is so wild, careening from terror to farce in a single leap, that
Anthony Clark's direction is caught flat- footed. There is an unnecessary
X-Rated brothel scene, and some sub-Hamlet goings-on in a graveyard which
slip out of control.
Tourneur's characters here represent nothing more than themselves, instead
of the viewpoints he meant them for. Their semi-modern costumes leave them
midway between Renaissance swagger and Cowardly poise.
The farce and horror mix uneasily: 'Draw out mine eyeballs and make envious
fortune play at tennis with them.' The latinate language is straight from
Jonson and the sentiment direct from Shakespeare: 'Our own constructions are
the authors of our misery.'

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Movie marathons fight it out - At the Berlin Film
Festival Nigel Andrews is caught between the pleasure principle and art
through pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's two retrospectives are devoted to Erich Von Stroheim and Sophia
Loren: strange - nay mind-boggling - bedfellows. Erich's is the face louring
from the posters with monocle, army cap and interrogation-room stare.
Sophia's is the face with sunripe pout and cascading Mediterranean locks.
The twinning is surely symbolic. Put Prussian strictness with Mediterranean
hedonism and what do you get? Something like the 44th Berlin Filmfestspiele
itself. The festival, like most of world cinema today, is caught between
pleasure-principle picturegoing and the old ethic of art through pain.
Nowhere is the tension greater than in the two main movie-marathons, both
French.
Jacques Rivette's six-hour, two-part Jeanne La Pucelle was shown within the
same 24 hours as Alain Resnais's 4 3/4 -hour, two-film diptych Smoking and
No Smoking, based on Alan Ayckbourn's play cycle Intimate Exchanges.
Both films flirt with avant-gardism while simultaneously wooing le grand
public. Rivette's epic passes Joan of Arc's story through the deconstruction
machine: no windy heroics, much blending of Brechtian tableaux with
Bressonian line-delivery. (Never let the voice range beyond one octave.) But
the film is still a surprising dollop of colour, accessibility and class
performances from the hitherto hermetic Rivette.
Resnais, 30 years after Marienbad, is still exploring the paradoxes of time
and memory. But this time it is 'Last Year In Hutton Buscel'. Here in
Ayckbourn's twee north-east English town (Scarborough by another name, but
all conjured on a soundstage), a headmaster (Pierre Arditti) and his wife
(Sabine Azema) and six other characters (all played by Arditti and Azema)
play Musical Destinies with a story scripted for multiple-choice
developments. Now she runs off with the gardener; now she doesn't. Now he
falls in love with the daily help; now he doesn't. Resnais/Ayckbourn keep
pressing that narrative rewind button.
I thought Rivette won the Old French Masters prizefight. Resnais keeps
dancing over the same stretch of canvas until interest yields to tedium. But
Rivette, boxing clever with history, makes his Joan (superbly played by
Sandrine Bonnaire) both a myth-glamourised icon and a modern girl fighting
for sexual-political equality. The film is accurate, it claims, to every dot
and comma of researched history. Hence no doubt its teasing rhythm,
alternating a quotidian banality of bills and meals and social minutiae with
the horrors and heroisms of war.
Shown in the noncompetitive Panorama section, Rivette's film is not in the
running for prizes. The favourite Golden Bear challengers so far are
Krszystof Kieslowski's Three Colours White and Tomas Gutierrez Alea's
Strawberry And Chocolate from Cuba.
The Polish film is part two of Kieslowski's tricouleur trilogy, tackling
'Equality' after his Blue dealt with 'Liberty.' (You need a computer to keep
up with all the diptychs, trilogies and films fleuves of modern cinema). For
a movie called White this comedy is bracingly black. It is very funny about
life in 'liberated' Eastern Europe, where the Warsovian hero (Zbiegniew
Zamachowski), scheming to lure his estranged French girlfriend over from
Paris, can buy anything on the markets of the New Capitalism from used cars
to dead bodies. All come in handy as the plot shifts gear all the way from
gentle romance to cynical overdrive.
Strawberry And Chocolate is also free with the gear-shift. For romance, here
is one-sided gay passion between young Diego (Jorge Perrugorria), an artist
whose high-camp manners and high-risk artworks attract the attentions of the
State, and the 'straight' young Communist David (Vladimir Cruz) sent in to
sound him out or set him right. For cynicism, here are buckets of witty
scorn thrown over the prejudices and repressive edicts of Castro's Cuba.
But Berlin has long been the cinematic capital of gay liberation. The most
fanfared American competition entry here is Philadelphia, with
Oscar-nominated Tom Hanks fighting Aids and homophobia from a Hollywood
hospital bed. Also rallying to the demo have been Zero Patience ('first ever
Aids musical'), Grief (almost first ever Aids comedy), Go Fire (no Aids, but
lots of lesbians) and Coming Out Under Fire and One Nation Under God
(gayness and anti-gayness in America and points East).
Moral: a city with the world's most famous fallen Wall knows all about
barriers between people and how to deal with them. Ironically, the one
barrier Berlin is still struggling to demolish, cinematically, is that
between East and West. Every year the festival proclaims its chief loyalty
to Europe, especially the neglected movie cultures of the former East; then
it exasperates everyone by filling the cinemas with films from the US.
This has two effects. It gives Berlin a schizoid personality: paying lip
service to Our Art while showcasing Their Entertainment. And it allows
Hollywood bounce and professionalism to expose the inadequacies of much
modern Euro-fare.
Who wants to sit through another dog-eared, chain-smoking French policier
even when lent spurious novelty value by a bisexual woman sleuth (Anemone in
Tonie Marshall's Pas Tres Catholique); or a damp-squib German satire about
film-making (Reinhard Munster's Back To Square One); or another Russian
movie attempting to revive the stylistic ghost of Tarkovsky (Aleksandr
Sokurov's Whispering Pages)?
Even Asia, regular miracle-worker at recent Euro-festivals, has failed to
deliver the goods at Berlin '94. Try China-Hong Kong's Competition-opener
Sparkling Fox, a sort of reject Aesop fable hijacked by the Orient, or
Japan's 800 Two-Lap Runners, all about the existential tremors of school
track-racing.
By contrast America, even outside the Competition, gave us DW Pennebaker's
humming docu-feature about the Clinton presidential campaign The War Room;
Francois Girard's massively witty mock-biopic 32 Short Films About Glenn
Gould, a sort of musicological Citizen Kane; and my favourite fringe lunacy
at Berlin to date, the documentary Tigrero.
Though this has a Finnish director, Miko Kaurismaki, the stars, story and
inspiration all come from across the Atlantic. We watch US film-makers Sam
Fuller and Jim Jarmusch revisit the Brazilian jungle where Sam, 40 years
ago, shot footage for an aborted John Wayne movie, the eponymous Tigrero.
Scratching around for memories and survivors, their double act plays like a
lost-in-the-forest version of Waiting For Godot. Jarmusch is droll and
deadpan; Fuller is crackpot and garrulous; the scenery is surreal; and the
Indians stand around wondering what has hit them and how long the Mad People
from Hollywood are staying. At Berlin, as far as many of us in this jungle
are concerned, they can stay indefinitely.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: All change at Arts Council - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anthony Everitt, who resigned yesterday as secretary general of the Arts
Council with one year of his contract still to run, has done the wise thing.
It is unlikely that Lord Gowrie, who takes over as chairman on April 1,
would have wanted his contract renewed. Everitt can now depart on the same
day as Lord Palumbo, and an era will come to an end.
The two men can be proud of the money they squeezed out of the government
over the years; less happy about the initiatives they launched which tended
to flounder or cause uproar. It was not specifically the fracas over the
London orchestras' funding which prompted Everitt's decision, but the
debacle came to symbolise indecisiveness at the top.
Significantly, all four men concerned with trying to create a super
orchestra - Lord Palumbo, Everitt, music director Ken Baird, and head of the
music panel Bryan Magee - are going or gone. Five Council members are also
due to retire. Grey Gowrie has a clear playing field in terms of personnel
and no obvious organisational nightmares. Everitt, who is returning to his
old life as a journalist, commented ruefully yesterday that, after spending
all this time in committees working out new structures, his successor can
enjoy himself with the arts.
Thoughts naturally turn to his successor. It is unlikely that his deputy
Mary Allen will rise to the post. The front runners must be Colin Tweedy,
who has run ABSA for over ten years and earned a bigger job; Timothy Mason,
once boss of the Scottish Arts Council and now licking the London Arts Board
into shape; and Mike Elliott of West Midland Arts, with Clive Priestley,
management consultant turned arts lover, as outsider.
It looked nasty on Wednesday night as the crowd pressed round the building.
A security guard tried to calm things with a megaphone, but with little
success. Tempers were frayed; there was real anger.
The disgruntled throng was the Friends of the Tate being forbidden entry to
the Picasso exhibition. The Tate had completely misjudged the numbers
anxious to see the show at the members' private evening. Six thousand turned
up; the gates had to be closed and hundreds went away frustrated. Millbank
was locked solid and became a no go area for taxis.
The Picasso show could be the most successful in the Tate's history. On the
first day paid admissions exceeded 3,500, which suggests a total attendance
approaching 300,000. Only the 1976 Constable exhibition, which attracted
313,000, is likely to prove more popular.
Don't phone Alan Ayckbourn over the next few days: the nation's most
performed living playwright is setting the week aside to create his 47nd
play. At the moment it is shaping up as a work of Hitchcockian menace, but
that could change. His last play started as a time travel comedy and then
turned nasty.
Ayckbourn was in Rome this week, which was a surprise since he hates
travelling and rarely leaves Scarborough. But as Montblanc, the luxury pen
people, was awarding him Dollars 25,000 as the European winner of its annual
culture prize, he made the trip. The money goes straight into his special
cause, the removal of his theatre, the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round,
from its cramped premises in a former school into a refurbished 1930s Odeon
cinema.
With luck the new theatre will open in the heart of Scarborough next spring.
There will be a small studio space seating up to 200, and a bigger area,
seating 400, and still in-the-round. The project costs Pounds 4.3m.
Ayckbourn has raised Pounds 2.4m and is not proud. 'We want one big sponsor
and will sell the name. I'm quite happy for it to be called after Mrs
Toshiba's granny'.
Ayckbourn has no wish to concentrate all his energies as artistic director
of the theatre. 'I've got at present two or three ideas banging around in my
head.' The plays will still flow. But fund raising is his current
pre-occupation. 'It's hard to prime the rusty Yorkshire pump. When I
approach local businessmen they say 'if its going to be that good, why are
you doing it here?''.

FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Anti-abortionists linked to theft of 'The Scream'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theft of Norway's most famous work of art took a bizarre twist this week
when two ex-communicated, anti-abortion activist priests from the country's
state Lutheran church hinted they may be connected to the crime.
Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' was stolen last Saturday from Norway's National
Gallery in Oslo. The painting had been moved to the first floor of the
gallery to allow easier access to a collection of Munch's emotionally
charged works during a special exhibition coinciding with the Lillehammer
Winter Olympics.
The theft, which took less than one minute and was filmed by video
surveillance cameras, has deeply embarrassed the government and caused a
public outcry in Norway over lax security of the country's art treasures.
On Thursday an anonymous fax linked to Borre Knudsen and Ludvig Nessa, the
two former priests, was sent to the Norwegian press. It showed a drawing of
a foetus with a woman, echoing 'The Scream', and asked the question: 'Which
is of greater value a child or a painting?'
Knudsen, interviewed on NRK national radio, said he would be willing to
steal 'The Scream' to promote his views. He suggested Munch's painting could
be recovered if the controversial anti-abortion film The Silent Scream was
shown on national television.
The investigation continues but many are sceptical about the activists'
connection to the theft and believe the pair may have sought to link
themselves to the theft in a ploy to gain media attention during the Winter
Olympics.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Malaysian PM says 'die is cast' over trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an early end to the Malaysian government's ban on trade with the UK
receded last night, when Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister,
said there would be 'no contracts in exchange for British Press freedom to
tell lies'.
In his most detailed explanation to date of the reasons for the ban, Dr
Mahathir says in a letter to the Financial Times that the 'die is cast'.
Malaysia decided three weeks ago to deny any future government contracts to
British companies because of its anger at British press reports of alleged
bribes offered to Malaysian politicians and disclosures of a link between a
Pounds 1bn defence contract won in 1988 and Pounds 234m of British aid for
the Pergau hydroelectric dam. The contracts freeze could cost UK companies
hundreds of millions of pounds in lost business.
Dr Mahathir says: 'If you have scruples, don't sell arms at all . . . When
arms are sold, long-term payments or offset programmes or special terms are
invariably offered by everyone.'
He adds: 'It has never been proven conclusively that it (the Pergau loan)
was for the arms purchase.'
He also says that the benefit for Malaysia of receiving the Pergau loan at a
subsidised interest rate, of 0.8 per cent, was 'marginal'. Malaysia could
have got similar terms from other countries such as Japan, he says.
If the subsidised loan had not been offered for Pergau, work on the dam
'could have gone to non-British companies'. The leading contractors on the
dam are the British construction groups Trafalgar House and BICC.
Dr Mahathir is convinced that the British media portrays Malaysians as
'corrupt' because 'they are not British and not white'. He continues: 'The
allegation against the Malaysian prime minister has turned out to be
baseless.'
He singles out The Sunday Times, which alleged that Malaysian politicians
had been offered bribes by the construction company Wimpey, for attack: 'The
Malaysian prime minister need not subscribe to that even as Andrew Neil
(editor of The Sunday Times) did not accept reports on his affair with
Pamella Bordes.'
Mr Neil said last night: 'The letter betrays a very confused mind.' He said
Dr Mahathir had not addressed the allegations made in last weekend's Sunday
Times that the Pergau loan had indirectly enriched Malaysians close to the
government, because it had been paid to an electricity company which was
privatised soon afterwards.

Foreign secretary Douglas Hurd told Conservative MPs he was not prepared to

veto. Hoping to unite the Tory party behind a compromise, he said
enlargement was a policy in Britain's national interests. Ministers are
still fighting to prevent the number of votes needed to block legislation
from rising from 23 to 27. Mr Hurd is understood to have told backbenchers
that '23 is best'.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Retail sales fall sparks calls for interest rate cuts:
Unemployment declines as earnings growth picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment resumed its downward path last month, but a sharp drop in
retail sales prompted calls for another cut in interest rates to help the
economy weather next month's tax increases.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally
adjusted 38,800 in February to 2,751,800, or 9.8 per cent of the UK
workforce, the lowest level since June 1992.
But retail sales dropped 0.5 per cent in February, dragging the year-on-year
growth rate down from 3.7 per cent in January to 2.5 per cent, the slowest
rate since May last year.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said it was time for an immediate
reduction in lending rates.
'The figures undermine bank and government optimism about the recovery,' he
said. 'Retail sales are falling even before taxes have gone up and the
government must act now to prevent further damage to the economy.'
But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, vigorously defended the tax increases
as necessary to keep the recovery going.
'We have a background of a large amount of borrowing, as does every other
country coming out of the recession,' he said.
According to Mr Clarke, the government's programme for dealing with the
budget deficit will enable the economic climate to carry on improving, keep
inflation down, and allow interest rates to remain low.
But yesterday's mixed set of figures also included the first pick-up in the
annual growth rate of average earnings for two years. This affected
sentiment in the government bond market, where investors grew uneasy that a
long period of subdued wage rises was coming to an end.
The underlying rate of growth of average earnings in January was 3.25 per
cent, higher than the 3 per cent analysts had expected. The June long gilt
future fell 1 1/4 points on the news to 110 25/32 . Shares also fell
yesterday, with the FT-SE 100 index falling 24.5 points to 3,242.9.
Overall, the official retail sales figures painted a less downbeat picture
than a survey from the Confederation of British Industry earlier this week
which showed two successive months of slowing retail sales growth. The
official figures, from the Central Statistical Office, included a sharp
upward revision to January's month-on-month increase, from 0.6 per cent to
0.9 per cent.
The employment figures showed that January's unexpected increase in
unemployment was revised even further upward, from 15,500 to 19,800.
Generally, the figures from the Department of Employment suggested many of
the jobs being created are not in traditional areas. A rise in the number of
the self-employed was the main cause of the increase in employment in the
fourth quarter of 1993. Manufacturing employment continued to decline, while
the quarterly Labour Force Survey showed a continuing shift to part-time
employment.
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, kept up pressure on the
department to alter the way it measures unemployment by saying that the
current figures gave a misleading impression of the true state of the labour
market. The employment department's chief statistician had, according to Mr
Prescott, admitted that changes to the count since 1979 had removed at least
400,000 from the official figures.
'That alone would push the official unemployment rate up to 11.2 per cent,'
said Mr Prescott.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BA separates out engineering side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways is setting up its engineering activities as a separate
profit centre next month in an effort to reduce the airline's overall
aircraft maintenance and engineering costs, as well as expand engineering
services to other carriers.
The engineering and aircraft maintenance activities employ about 10,000
people out of BA's total 50,000 strong workforce and include facilities at
London's Heathrow airport and in Wales, where BA overhauls Boeing 747 jumbo
airliners and recently opened an aircraft avionics repair and maintenance
centre.
The engineering activities headed by Mr Alistair Cumming are also expected
to be strengthened by imminent management changes to boost the company's
engineering management team.
BA's engineering operations have seen significant growth over the last three
years. The company, which outlined yesterday its plans to its unions to
transform the engineering business from a cost centre into a profit centre,
sees strong potential for further growth in aircraft maintenance and
engineering services.
Already about 15 per cent of BA's overall engineering activities involves
work for other carriers and the airline hopes to develop this third party
business through its latest reorganisation.

<TEXT>
Carlson Companies of the US and Accor of France are pooling their business
travel operations in a joint venture, Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT), which
they plan to develop globally for their corporate clients.
With more than 4,000 travel agencies in 125 countries providing Dollars
10.8bn in revenue, they said the joint venture would have 8 per cent of the
world business travel market, 20 per cent ahead of their nearest rival,
American Express.
Through their combined purchasing power and synergies in computer
reservation systems and in developing a new travel credit card, the CWT
joint venture is aiming for a cheaper service for corporate clients.
The CWT joint venture will be 'a real working union, not a paper
partnership,' claimed Mr Travis Tanner, president of Carlson Travel.
However, the two parent groups will keep their respective hotel activities,
and even in business travel only envisage a full merger after their joint
activities are working smoothly.

The mastermind of one of China's largest fraud schemes has been sentenced to
death and a former vice-minister jailed for 20 years for corruption in the
case, it was revealed yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Honesty urged over failure in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading British charity yesterday called for 'an open acknowledgment of
the scale of sub-Saharan Africa's development fail-ure'.
In a strongly-worded attack on the World Bank's latest report on the region,
Oxfam said that bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed
to 'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty'.
The charity, which is heavily involved in Africa, declared that adjustment
programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through interest rates
and unrealistic money supply targets.
'Poorly planned and sequenced import liberalisation measures' had 'exposed
potentially competitive local industries to ruinous competition from
imports' Oxfam said in its statement.
The British charity accused the bank of 'complacency' in the face of what it
called Africa's 'deepening development crisis'.
The charity also attacked the bank's classification in its report of
Zimbabwe as a successful adjusting country as 'bordering on outright
deception'.
Zimbabwe's adjustment programme did not come until operation until 1991,
says Oxfam: 'Since when there has been no sign of recovery in investment or
export growth'.

President Clinton has told Congress that he is extending the US moratorium
on nuclear testing until September 1995, the White House said yesterday,
Reuter reports.
White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the decision was based in part on
the restraint of other declared nuclear powers in not resuming testing in
response to China's test last October. She also credited the encouraging
progress in comprehensive test ban talks since they opened in January.

Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organisation, yesterday
accused the Colombian armed forces and related paramilitary groups of
responsibility for most of the 20,000 political killings in the country

Amnesty said governments had escaped international criticism in part by
hiding behind a public relations smokescreen, which portrayed a 'myth' that
drug traffickers and guerrillas were mainly to blame.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Spanish workers prepare to fight Suzuki cutbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Suzuki's Spanish subsidiary remained in doubt yesterday after
workers flatly refused to negotiate drastic job cuts demanded by the
Japanese company.
Suzuki told union leaders it intended to reduce the labour force at its main
plant in Linares by 70 per cent from 2,437 to 941. The company also plans to
reduce production of the four-wheel drive vehicles that the factory produces
by 50 per cent to 25,000 units this year and to impose a two-year wage
freeze.
Earlier this week Suzuki said it would drop a threat to close the plant if
unions agreed to job cuts. Santana, which is some 80 per cent owned by
Suzuki, applied for receivership last month saying it had sustained
accumulated losses of Pta21bn (Dollars 151m) in the past three years.
Union leaders said Suzuki had delivered a 'take it or leave it' ultimatum
which was completely unacceptable. They said there was no point in further
talks and that they would now concentrate on mobilising the Linares area in
southern Spain, where Santana represents the sole industrial activity and
provides for more than 30,000 indirect jobs.
The anger in Linares has been fuelled by the failure by both Suzuki and the
regional government to implement an agreement signed last year. Suzuki had
agreed to wage increases of between 4-6 per cent and to raise output to
50,000 units a year, while the authorities had promised subsidies.
The Santana union leaders are understood to be preparing big demonstrations
in Madrid at the weekend when the ruling Socialist party meets to holds its
national congress. Yesterday, plant workers put up road blocks around
Linares and temporarily occupied government offices in the nearby provincial
capital of Jaen.
The future of Santana, which previously made Land Rover vehicles, has been
in doubt since early last year.
The issue came to a head when the company filed for protection from
creditors on February 18, provoking fierce public reaction in Linares and
the surrounding region.
The strength of the Santana protest against the parent company Suzuki has
created concern in the government about its possible impact on the climate
for foreign investment in Spain.
The dispute has also generated political worries, with regional elections in
Andalucia less than three months away.

Weak links mean big risks - System security / As increasing amounts of data
are moved around the world, the need to maintain security integrity has
become paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a direct relationship between the number of information tools used
by a company and the chances of its information system being insecure.
A singleton PC used at home can be the victim of the occasional virus, which
is often irritating to the user but rarely fatal to the system or the
information. For a company with multiple, linked networks of PCs,
workstations, departmental servers and enterprise repositories, however, the
potential risks can border on the incalculable.
The PC has moved from being little more than a toy used for tactical
personal productivity applications to become one of the key strategic tools
for delivering meaningful information to users. As such it has moved
centre-stage in the on-going struggle to keep information secure and systems
up and running.
The problem is, of course, that the PC's history contains nothing to
associate it with the concept of security. As security consultant, Robert
Schifreen, suggested, even DOS, the PC's native operating system, can be
readily re-written to make the machines a source of secure information.
'For example, it is possible to embed code in the operating system that will
log all keystrokes made on a PC,' he says. 'In that way, log-in sequences
and passwords can be recorded for later use.'
As increasing amounts of sensitive data are moved around the world using
datacommunications technologies, the need to maintain security and integrity
becomes paramount. This not only affects how users should view the weak
links in their information systems - predominantly the PCs being used - but
also security at a higher level.
Until now this has started to look like a problem solved. The US Government
is, however, currently considering throwing what many see as a large spanner
in the works, in the form of what is generally referred to as the Clipper
Chip technology.
Currently, many companies regularly employ a data encryption technology
known as DES (the Data Encryption System). This is one of several
alternatives that are, ironically, published specifications. This would seem
to degrade their value, but as Schifreen put it: 'Everyone knows how DES
works, but it is not easy to crack. It can be done, but it would need a team
of programmers a year and a Cray supercomputer to do it. By being a
published specification everyone knows the weaknesses of DES and works to
plug them.'
The US Government is currently considering an alternative to these
encryption systems, based around a hardware chip, known as the Clipper Chip,
which would contain the encryption algorithm. A company using the chip would
then be able to pass encrypted data to any other using the same system.
What has upset users, according to Schifreen, is the fact that the US
Government is considering passing use of this CIA-developed encryption
technology into law. All US datacommunications users would then be legally
obliged to employ Clipper, which would mean that recipients around the world
would also be obliged to use it. What makes the situation worse is the fact
that Clipper is a proprietary system, and that the CIA has written a back
door into the technology allowing information to be decrypted.
The fear is that, either through theft, or the actions of a disgruntled
employee, this code could fall into the wrong hands. Another fear is that,
because it is from the CIA, the backdoor code may be made available to other
national authorities.
Perhaps most important of all, however, is that because it is a proprietary
solution, its method of working and its weaknesses remain unknown. As all
encryption systems are ultimately breakable, this is being seen as a serious
potential weakness of the system.
As PCs become more prevalent as a strategic tool, other weaknesses may serve
to compound the potential problems of Clipper encryption. For example,
access control on PCs is still a weak area, though there are now products
available to solve the problem, if companies are willing to make the
investments necessary. This may be significant, for the most comprehensive
solutions can cost up to Pounds 1,000 per PC.
Many new PCs come with access control available as standard, but these tend
to be simple password systems where the password is stored in a
battery-backed CMOS memory. Removing the battery, therefore, will normally
circumvent the password.
Investment in security is a key factor not always considered by users. This
starts with education about the simplest access issues. For example, it is
rare for thought to be given to individual passwords and most people make
obvious choices. 'Many users choose words like FRED, SECRET, PASSWORD and
LETMEIN,' Schifreen said, 'which are easy to guess.'
Even Unix systems, increasingly popular both as workstations and servers,
suffer access control weaknesses. For example, there is a well-known bug in
Unix Mail which will allow embedded code in a mail message, which runs when
the message is read. The code can, for example, request the system to
transmit the receiver's password file back to the sender.
It can also be used to transmit a complete system's password listing. This
contains user IDs and their apparently safely encrypted passwords. There
are, however, shareware products available - such as Websters, a program
with 234,000 unique English words - which, when passed through the Unix
encryption algorithm, will produce a table against which the encrypted
passwords can be compared, and cracked. Using numerals in passwords usually
helps solve this problem.
Many such routes into systems can be trapped with sufficient thought and
planning by users. For example, an increasing number of these programs are
now available from Bulletin Board Systems, so access by staff to such
systems must be closely monitored, particularly on the larger networks. One
way of doing this is to audit the applications being run.
There is now a new class of application appearing that scans all the disks
on a network to locate and report on all applications found. This should
include those that are hidden behind filenames that do not include the
standard applications file extensions such as . exe, .com and . bas.
In this way, systems managers can know the location of all approved
applications, as well as those that are not approved. The benefits of this
are two-fold. Not only are potential security risk applications identified.
It also ensures that no illegal copies of applications are being used,
preventing possible legal action by the application's authors.

New paging system for Dutch prisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch group Teletechnicom and the Swindon-based company Blick Telefusion
have won a contract to upgrade potentially life-saving radio-paging systems
installed in Dutch prisons.
Since 1986, the two companies have held the contract to supply radio-paging
systems to 30 of the 45 prisons in Holland. But an unprecedented series of
attacks on prison guards forced the Dutch ministry of justice to put out a
tender for a more sophisticated system to be developed.
Hostage situations have resulted in serious injury and even loss of life.
The new paging system is marketed abroad under the title, Bodyguard.
Location signals can be sent out by the pagers each time a guard passes one
the many location code transmitters installed in prisons buildings.
The pagers also register the last two loctions of the user in case of
emergency and loss of contact. This data is relayed to a computer terminal
programmed to show the location of all guards, using a schematic display of
the prison.
Others features include a 'man down' alarm, triggered by a floating mercury
switch, a silent hostage alert button.

GPT Communication Systems has won a large order from the Central Computer
Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) for the supply, installation and
maintenance of a new computerised telephone directory serving all 62
government departments in Whitehall.
The new system enables operators based in the Treasury to reduce response
times significantly for about 5,000 enquiries each working day.
Mr Peter Spencer of the telecommunications division of the CCTA, explains:
'With over 30,000 people working in more than 60 different departments, our
original system of using up to 12 paper directories had become too slow and
cumbersome, with an average response time of 25 seconds - too high for what
is essentially a public service.'
The new system allows the CCTA to locate individuals and redirect calls in a
fraction of the time, eliminating caller-frustration, he adds.

Pioneering with the cordless office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most office workers are still 'tied to their desks' by fixed
telephones, a new generation of cordless telephone systems is set to open up
a market worth up to Dollars 5bn a year by 1998, according to Ericsson, a
pioneering company in this sector.
Ericsson began developing business cordless phone systems in the mid-1980s
andclaims to be the first company to launch a DECT-based system, last year.
This Freeset system works as an 'add-on' to a company's existing phone
network. Low-powered radio base-stations are installed throughout the
premises, and controlled from a radio exchange, which connect directly to
the host telephone system. The main groups of users are organisations with a
large number of mobile staff - such as hospitals, factories and exhibition
centres - where instant communication is important.
The second main group of users are companies which are trying to redefine
the nature of office work, applying the 'hot desk' principle. Digital
Equipment Corporation, using the Freeset system, has been successfully
experimenting with a similar concept which it calls 'the natural office' at
its Swedish offices in Stockholm.
'Once people start using a cordless phone at work, it's impossible to take
it away from them,' comments Ericsson's Hans van der Hoek. In five years'
time, he expects one-third of all business phones sold will be cordless.

Most finance directors are dissatisfied with data management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the widespread acceptance of information technology, more than half
of the finance directors in a recent poll of top companies are still
dissatisfied with the quality of their current information management.
This is one of the findings of a survey by the independent research group,
MRD, which targeted financial directors from 100 leading companies in the
UK.
While more than half the companies are now using their own internal IT
department's resources to develop their strategies for information
technology, only 13 per cent say they use an external IT resource.
Together, these companies represented an investment in IT of more than
Pounds 175m.
The survey, commissioned by European Software Publishing (ESP), says that 98
per cent of respondents felt that personal computers had made their work
more productive, but the time-factor - not 'technofear' - was seen as the
greatest restraint on the wider use of technology.
'Even though the technology is sitting on their desks, still relatively few
managers are using the communications and information-sharing capabilities
of information technology,' adds the report.
'Large amounts of their day are spent in communicating - meeting,
telephoning, and so on - with their workgroup colleagues, but few are fully
using technology to support and enhance these activities.'

Finding solutions takes time - Fast software development / Object-oriented
computing is widely acknowledged to be the future direction for software
development. But discovering ways to build software fast is a painstaking
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
In the ultra-competitive business world of the 1990s, a company's ability to
create new information systems rapidly is a pre-requisite for survival.
The key is to find ways to build application software which are both
flexible and scalable. Object-oriented computing, which sees an information
system as a set of self-contained components, is the most promising approach
and it is steadily gaining favour with both software developers and users.
Fast software development is a priority for both groups. A survey of
delegates to last October's 'Objectworld' conference in the UK, for example,
cited 'flexibility to change' and 'reduced time to market' as the two main
reasons for adopting the object-oriented.
Object-oriented computing is widely acknowledged to be the future direction
for software development and most software developers have pledged their
allegiance to the cause. The Object Management Group (OMG), an industry
organisation which promotes object-oriented computing, now claims 370
members and points to growing attendance at shows and exhibitions.
The object-oriented approach is making the running at both extremes and is
central to any debate on speeding up the production of software.
There are several reasons:
Firstly, object-oriented systems are built from sets of components which can
be re-used elsewhere.
This speeds up the development of new applications and makes existing ones
easier to maintain.
Secondly, object-oriented systems operate in a way that makes software
'portable' to other platforms and preserves investment in application
software.
Thirdly, objects reduce the complexity of applications software by enforcing
tight design disciplines.
Most importantly, object-oriented development techniques make it easy to
build prototype systems to demonstrate to users - which is widely
acknowledged as one of the keys to speedy application development.
'I think rapid application development is as much about the approach as it
is about the tools you use,' says Mr Vic Morris, UK managing director of
tools specialist Powersoft.
'As far as possible you want to break the application down to make it easier
for end users to do it themselves.
'If you look at what many users have done with their PCs - building complex
applications with spreadsheets, for example - you can harness that talent,'
he goes on.
Thinking of applications in terms of objects is the key, according to Mr
Morris.
'In the past, we viewed applications as a set of functions like, say, an
order processing system. It was very structured. Now with objects, we can
think in terms of business processes and put in place applications which can
support them,' he explains.
Mr Morris also places emphasis on the 'scalability' of applications. This
means, for example, an application program built for two or three users on a
small network should be able to cope with hundreds - or even thousands - of
users on a much larger system.
'We have recently re-positioned our Powerbuilder tool set to reflect this.
So you can start with a cheap desktop version and move up to a full
networked version and keep the same applications,' Mr Morris says.
Other tool vendors have taken a similar approach because it can speed up
production of larger systems if you can start with small ones and 'scale'
them up.
'All our tools are based on Smalltalk so you can move from our desktop
product Enfin to our corporate Synchrony product,' says Mr Jeff Sutherland,
vice-president of object development at software tools company Easel.
'But it is not enough just to scale up to a large number of users. You need
greater access to database and tools which can deliver the performance.
'We see the answer in tools which will do 80 per cent of what a user wants
automatically. The users can then concentrate on the bits they understand
best - the business objects,' he says.
Mr Sutherland believes that not enough is being done to promote object
technology at the application level. He is part of a group of software
developers pushing for the specification of business-based 'objects'.
'We have a problem at the moment with object-oriented technology. People
talk a lot about code re-use - but where is it?
'We see the need for re-usable business objects which can give different
views of the way the business operates to different users,' says Mr
Sutherland.
There are other, more serious, reservations about the use of object-oriented
design for speeding up software - initially, at least.
'Although object-oriented is the way forward, it is not a panacea. It's a
solid framework to build re-usable code,' says Mr Paul Burford, a systems
engineer with object-oriented tool specialist Next Computer.
'In the short term, it is not a quick way to get more out of programmers.
Although it reduces the number of lines of code you need to produce, there
is much more design input needed'.
Mr Burford cites the example of the Swiss Bank which used Next's Nextstep
object-oriented tool to build its systems.
'When we started at Swiss Bank four years ago we wrote objects that were not
re-usable so there was no advantage. But they recognised over time that they
had chunks of re-usable software,' he says.
'If you take a new environment it will never be quicker to start with
because of teething problems. But by taking an object-oriented approach you
have a chance to start putting in new features in a more natural way'.
While object-oriented design techniques provide a suitable framework for
building applications, the real productivity benefits come from software
tools.
Strategies for selecting development tools differ - according to the size
and data processing heritage of the individual company.
Larger companies tend to bring in programmer productivity tools so that
their information systems departments can respond more rapidly to users'
demands.
Smaller companies give their users their own desktop tools. Many companies
combine both of these approaches.
The result is a growing demand for tools which can support fast software
development and there is no doubt that these tools will use object-oriented
computing as a starting point.
What is clear, however, is that finding ways to build software fast, takes
time.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (28): A
central link in the chain - Factory of the future / Most of Britain's
leading manufacturing companies expect to invest heavily in information
technology in the next five years, reports Andrew Baxter. The most popular
planned investments are manufacturing management systems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
After 20 years of dramatic developments in the information technology used
by manufacturers - from the earliest computer-aided design systems to modern
relational databases and shopfloor management systems  - there is no let-up
in the pace of change.
Information technology (IT) vendors still see plenty of opportunities to
fulfil the changing needs of manufacturing companies, while the customers
are reacting to the disappointments of the past by taking steps to ensure
their IT needs really are met in future.
It is partly because of past disappointments, and the fact that previous
investments are no longer compatible with newer technologies, that spending
on IT by manufacturers remains a high priority.
According to a MORI survey last month for the ASK Group, developers of
business software, and the accountants Coopers  Lybrand, 82 per cent of 100
companies picked at random from the UK's top 1,000 manufacturers expect to
invest heavily in IT in the next five years - and 60 per cent of managers
expect to spend more than Pounds 1m.
The most popular planned investments are manufacturing management systems,
where 73 per cent plan to spend money, and supply chain systems to improve
performance, where 62 per cent expect to invest.
This year's Computers in Manufacturing Show, at the National Exhibition
Centre, Birmingham, from November 22-24, will demonstrate some of the
state-of-the-art IT products seen by industry as a priority for their
broader business needs. Examples are virtual reality and rapid prototyping
tools to improve and accelerate product development, and just-in-time
software which allows manufacturers to operate lean production techniques.
These and other technology developments now becoming available provide some
clues as to what will be the IT needs of the factories of the future.
Mr Graham Williams, managing director of ATT Istel's manufacturing
division, believes the next five years could be exciting because of the
products which IT vendors are offering industry in order to help to tackle
key manufacturing problems.
The need for manufacturers to get closer to consumers has spawned the
concept of the extended enterprise in which not only suppliers, but also
distribution, is included. For example, says Mr Williams, IT can be used by
brewers as a means of viewing the hop-grower and also the public house as
part of its enterprise.
Similarly, the generation of electronic point-of-sales data can produce a
works order, and in turn create all the orders for materials and
sub-assemblies. This would aid the lean production process, as manufacturers
would only be making what their customers were buying.
All the technology to do this exists, says Mr Williams. Indeed, it is
already happening to some extent in the food industry, and will start to
happen very quickly in the process industries.
Mr Cliff Shuker, managing director of ATT Istel's Rover division, sees an
increasing need for IT applications that can be applied horizontally across
processes rather than simply used to improve the performance of individual
functions or departments.
Also, as customers increasingly dictate what happens in factories, they will
use IT to inject their requirements straight into manufacturers' production
schedules. Moreover,the development of massive databases provides the basis
for neural networks which can aid decision-making by tapping into past
experience.
IT users in manufacturing, too, have been thinking about the next steps in
their use of manufacturing technology. The most important initiative among
users is the AIT project - advanced information technology in design and
manufacturing - which is headed by Daimler-Benz and stems from users'
demands for more effective IT and better integration of systems at different
sites.
The pilot phase for the project, which comprises 16 aerospace and automotive
companies from six countries, began last November and the overall aim is to
strengthen the competitiveness of key European industries by three
consecutive action in three areas.
First, the initiative will seek to establish a consensus among European
industrial users of IT on their most important future requirements for
design and manufacturing.
Secondly, it will seek an agreement on these requirements with the IT
vendors, and, thirdly, an IT research and development initiative will be
launched to support the commonly-agreed requirements.
Significantly, the initiative's backers say they want it to become a
substantial user force recognised by the IT community, to ensure that future
products meet users' requirements.
Two other projects, combining users, vendors and universities, underline
further priorities for the development of IT in the factories of the future.
Just before Christmas, Crawley-based Reflex Manufacturing Systems, a
subsidiary of Rolls-Royce Aerospace, won approval from the European Union
for a project under the Esprit programme known as Discrete Cell Control.
Over the past five years, the adoption of manufacturing cells has grown
rapidly in industry because of their contribution to flexible manufacturing,
reducing work-in-progress and enhancing teamwork and multi-skilling.
Helped by an Ecu 1.3m Esprit grant, project leader Reflex and its partners
will, over the next 18 months, develop an open applications framework aimed
at providing a firm foundation for all cell control systems.
Reflex, a software house which specialises in manufacturing control and shop
floor scheduling systems, says the DCC will provide the means to design and
build systems, and empower autonomous cell operation, while enabling the
cell to co-operate with other production and engineering teams.
Mr Terry Jones, managing director of Reflex, says the aim is a standard cell
control environment which different IT suppliers can plug into efficiently.
Internal and external customers would also be able to view where their
products are in the cell.
The applicability of DCC will be evaluated through pilot projects at two of
Reflex' partners in the scheme, Intracom, the Greek electronics and telecoms
equipment company, and the Odense Shipyard in Denmark.
Odense, which has moved to cell manufacturing to produce super-tankers is
also involved in a project being carried out under the auspices of the
five-continent Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Initiative. This aims to
work out how concurrent engineering - interdisciplinary teamwork to
accelerate product development - can be carried out in a global
manufacturing context.
TransTec, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering group, is leading the
European side of the project. Like the Reflex project, it aims to design an
architecture - in this case of a CE system for global, multi-site
application.

The Picasso system
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ATT's Picasso still-image phone, above, allows users to send full-colour,
TV-quality still pictures, using an ordinary phone line - while
simultaneously talking over the same line. The system, priced at Dollars
3,295, takes about ten seconds to transmit a single image. The intended
market is for engineers and other professionals needing fast transmission of
detailed images.
The device looks like an office phone, but contains a data modem and
transceiver. To transmit a picture, users plug in a video camera, photo
compact disk player or digital still cameras. On the receiving end, a
computer monitor or TV set displays the picture.

Interaction of created worlds - Virtual Reality / Optimists see virtual

a disturbing retreat from the grimness of real life. Here, Philip Manchester
looks at one of the likely growth markets of the next decade
</HEADLINE>

Many advances in computer software have their origins in play. From the
early chess programs, which were used to demonstrate the power of electronic
brains in the 1950s, to the multimedia shoot-'em-up video games of today,
programmers have used games to push the envelope of software technology.
Advances in high-resolution graphics, data compression, animation and user
interface design have often been pioneered in games software before making
the transition to business. Games and other leisure-based uses of computers
have also laid the ground rules for computer-generated, alternative worlds
or what has come to be called virtual reality (VR). This new strain of
software now promises to open exciting applications in business.
'One way to see VR is as a magical window on to other worlds from molecules
to minds. Another way to see VR is to recognise that in the closing decades
of the twentieth century, reality is disappearing behind a screen,' writes
Howard Rheingold in his book, Virtual Reality.
It could be argued that anyone who sits in front of a computer all day to do
their job, already spends much of their life in VR. Even a simple program
like a spreadsheet can be engrossing enough to its user to suspend physical
reality.
The convergence of computers and communications pushes this even further.
Bulletin board systems and networked chatlines are now well established in
the US and growing fast in Europe. Network services like the Internet, CIX
and Compuserve have created a multitude of widely-dispersed, electronic
communities, each with their own culture. The phenomenon has spawned a new
language, a literary sub-genre (cyberpunk) and the idea of an ultimate
virtual nirvana called cyberspace.
There is, of course, not just one virtual reality, but many. At one extreme,
it is possible to become immersed in VR by using an enclosed helmet with a
built-in display and sensor devices which can pick up body movements.
At the other end of the spectrum, a serious desktop flight simulator such as
Microsoft's package for the PC, can be just as convincing.
VR purists argue that immersion is the only genuine VR experience and there
is research into all-over body suits which can take this to its logical
conclusion. The aim is that such a suit should act both as sensing device to
transfer body movements to the computer and also to convey a sense of touch.
Sensor suits to transmit body movement are already available. At the Virtual
Reality Expo show in London in February, for example, the UK company Virtual
Presence launched a 750 gram, Lycra suit equipped with 96 sensors, and there
are others available in the US.
Work is also under way to build systems which can respond to objects in VR
and transmit this sensation back to the user. Researchers at the University
of North Carolina, for example, have built a device which can be used to
manipulate images of molecules with a full feedback system. The Argonne
remote manipulator (ARM) is used to explore possible combinations of
molecules for new anti-cancer drugs. If the properties of the molecules do
not allow them to fit together, the resistance is conveyed back to the user
as a physical force.
There is also some speculation in fringe literature about the possibility of
direct connections from the human brain to VR systems - thus eliminating the
need for a suit.
At a more mundane and practical level, less intrusive VR software is now
within the reach of the PC user - mainly for games - but increasingly for
other activities such as mail order shopping or travel planning. Desktop
computers are now powerful enough to handle high-quality, three-dimensional
graphics and convey an impression of space. It is now possible to walk
around buildings which do not exist, fly a jumbo jet through a thunderstorm
and visit places on the other side of the world without leaving your desk.
The concept of VR has, of course, been around for some time. The
well-established flight simulator, for example, has been used for training
pilots since the early days of flying. More recently, simulated environments
have been devised for other training activities - such as working in
hazardous environments.
What marks out the new generation of VR software is that it goes beyond
merely representing the physical world - like a flight simulator - or
creating a possible future with a spreadsheet. VR enables the creation of
worlds which do not exist and allows interaction with them.
This has spawned a generation of software tools which can help to visualise
data in new ways.
Superscape, a VR tool from the UK company Dimension, has been used, for
example, to show the effects of drugs on the human body. The software allows
a user to navigate around a representation of the body and see the effect of
a drug down at the molecular level.
'The market is only now becoming aware that VR products are available for
low-cost computing. Once their eyes are opened to it, the ideas come rushing
in. We have about 30 applications built with Superscape and most of them
have come from customers,' says Mr Ian Andrew, managing director of
Dimension.
In addition to the drug simulation VR, which is being used by SmithKline
Beecham, Superscape has been used to build VR environments as diverse as a
telecommunications network simulation for British Telecom and an exhibition
modelling system for Dragon Exhibitions.
Although Superscape can support the more exotic VR peripherals, such as
headsets and sensors, Mr Andrew says that the demand is for applications
which are non-immersive and based on the desktop: 'Immersive VR was what
caught people's imagination in the first place - but most people are
uncomfortable with it. I'd say 90 per cent of what we do is for the desktop.
But we have left room to support the other devices and can offer users an
upgrade path when they need it,' he explains.
Faberushi, another UK VR specialist has built a multimedia virtual
exhibition system (VES) which re-creates the sound, look and feel of an
exhibition floor. Virtual visitors to the show can walk up to a virtual
computer screen and see a demonstration of a product.
'The interaction between people and machines is what is important about VR.
It lets you create spatial relationships which is very appealing - people
understand the rules of space,' says Mr Perry Huber, a consultant with
Faberushi.
'Proper VR allows you to move around in free form - like surrogate travel.'
Mr Huber also sees VR changing the way we use computers and improving the
user interface: 'One of the obvious things in the business environment is
that you can get way from simple graphical user interfaces. The three
dimensionality lets you bring a context to data and visualise it better.'
Data visualisation in three dimensions might seem far fetched. But imagine
explaining what a spreadsheet program could be used for ten years' ago.
VR offers the same potential to change the way data is viewed and presented.
Software developers are already experimenting with the possibilities. Maxis,
a US software company, has built a VR package which simulates the Wall
Street Stock Exchange in the form of a casino. Prospective investors can
risk their funds and enjoy themselves at the same time.
The market for VR products like these is expected to grow quickly over the
next few years and an increasing percentage of revenues will come from
commercial applications. Market researcher Frost  Sullivan (FS) forecasts
a growth rate of 65 per cent a year in the US market, with revenues
exceeding a billion dollars by 1997.
Leisure-based applications are expected to dominate throughout this period
and show the largest growth. Another US market researcher - 4th Wave -
estimates that 70 per cent of 1993 revenues for VR products came from the
entertainment sector and this will increase to 76 per cent by 1997.
But commercial applications of VR technology on the desktop are likely to be
the most profitable - with training, data visualisation and computer-aided
design leading the way. Specialised commercial applications which can
harness the power of VR software will sell at a premium.
The parallel growth of high bandwidth telecommunications and multimedia
technology - both of which provide the infrastructure for VR applications -
promises to make the market for VR software one of the most exciting growth
areas into the millennium.
VR could also precipitate change in wider context.
The pessimistic view is that it will lead to the disturbing future described
by Aldous Huxley where people hide from the grimness of the physical world
at the 'feelies'. The optimistic view is that VR will enable humans to find
a richer form of communication, unimpeded by the laws of the real world.
One thing is clear, an increasing amount of communication between humans
will be mediated by computer software and, even when this is not called VR,
that is exactly what it will be.

<TEXT>
The business opportunities that virtual reality software technology can
offer were underlined recently by the public flotation of the UK company,
Virtuality Group.
It came to the London Stock Exchange in October 1993 with a share price of
170p, valuing the company at Pounds 44m and turning its founders into
multi-millionaires, writes Philip Manchester.
Since then, the share price has doubled and Virtuality is seen as a hot
investment.
Started as W Industries in 1987 in the classic computer industry style - in
a garage on the outskirts of Leicester in the UK - Virtuality earned
revenues of about Pounds 5m last year from sales of VR equipment and
software, placing it among the world leaders of the emerging VR industry.
Its customers include Matsushita, MCA Universal Studios and games company
Sega.
Virtuality has also attracted investment funds from IBM and Motorola, and
has ambitious plans in the VR software industry.
Co-founder and managing director Dr Jonathan Waldren is reported as saying
he wants the company to be the Microsoft of VR.
Virtuality's current products are at the high end of the VR market. The
company concentrates on what it calls leisure products - although its
definition includes education applications, as well as advertising and
promotional tools.
Virtuality's primary product is an 'immersive' arcade game machine which
sells for Pounds 25,000 upwards.
Sega plans to install Virtuality games in the 'super-arcades' it is building
world-wide.

new world on your desktop - Clever software helps cut the cost of virtual
reality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
One of the most important recent developments in Virtual Reality (VR) is the
fall in prices of hardware and software packages.
VR systems demand large computer resources and high-quality input and output
 -which has been expensive until recently.
But advances in hardware technology, such as faster PC processors, larger
capacity storage and graphics software have made desktop systems possible.
The most important element is the clever software which is needed firstly,
to build a virtual reality to suit a specific need and, secondly, allow a
user to visit and inter-act with it.
UK-based software developer Dimension sees a growing opportunity in the
emerging commercial market for VR tools on the desktop.
Its Superscape package, which sells for around Pounds 3,500, can be used to
build specific VR environments on a desktop computer.
The package has a broad range of users from British Telecom, which has built
a virtual network with Superscape, to the Shepherd School, which is using VR
to help children with learning difficulties.
One of the more exciting applications of Superscape is Tyne and Wear
Development Corporation's creation of VR model of the Pounds 180m Quayside
development in Newcastle.
The VR Quayside is being used to view how the development will look in
advance and sell it to prospective investors.

The clear message: innovate or perish - Technology developments in Canada /
Canada's successful IT companies demonstrate that to survive they must be
show greater speed and originality than their US competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you live next to a country as large as the US and want to succeed in
the information technology sector, you have to innovate to survive.
That is the story behind Canada's best personal computer and
telecommunications companies - which seem to win new business by creating
specialised solutions for surprisingly common challenges.
Take the success of Canadian personal computer fax software maker Delrina,
which hit the world markets in a big way with its WinFax software for
Microsoft Windows, a few years ago. Many companies had tried to produce
software which allowed users to fax documents direct from their PC screens,
but none had ever really achieved much success with it until this Canadian
company came along.
By closely identifying a need for simple design, low cost and an ability to
work with dozens of popular personal computer fax modems, Delrina almost
created the market for Windows-based fax software. Today it dominates that
market. It has been successful in building on the reputation of WinFax with
a range of form-design products and fax add-on systems, and operates in a
number of countries including a subsidiary operation in the UK.
Likewise, the Toronto-based Vivid Group identified at an early stage the
potential of 'virtual reality' technology. Using its implementation of this
idea, it started building entertainment and education systems.
Today, the company's Mandala System, an interactive virtual reality product,
allows users to indulge in a variety of 'virtual' experiences including
virtual ice hockey (something guaranteed to make it a big hit in Canada),
virtual volley ball or soccer, and even a virtual swim in the shark-infested
waters of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The Vivid Group recently won the
ultimate accolade for its virtual reality technology when it was selected to
provide a key element of Paramount Pictures' Virtual Star Trek Transporter
Experience.
According to The Computer Paper, the founder and publisher of Canada's
largest computer publication, many successes of this kind do not stay
Canadian for very long. Douglas Alder, who founded The Computer Paper seven
years ago, says that moderate success is quite commonly followed by US
corporate acquisition.
He says that even raising initial venture capital is a tough slog for most
Canadian developers and entrepreneurs. 'There just aren't enough
millionaires in Canada,' he says. And even when Canadian companies do
achieve moderate success, there is no 'peer group of aspiring billionaires'
willing to spend the money, time and energy to help grow the Canadian
companies - 'most companies don't make it,' Alder says.
And when they do make it, they often become American companies in due
course. Take the case of SoftImage, the Quebec-based computer animation
specialists, recently acquired by US software house Microsoft for Dollars
130m.
In this case, SoftImage will be allowed to stay in Quebec and pursue its
existing business - while its technology will also be incorporated in future
Microsoft products.
Microsoft has been quite active in the Canadian technology sector. In 1991
it purchased Consumers Software, another Canadian company, and turned it
into its first big North American research and development facility outside
the United States.
Based in Vancouver, it now employs more than 100 people and has been renamed
Microsoft Workgroup Canada.
'We see a bright future for Canadian business and the local personal
computer industry,' says Mike Maples, executive vice-president at Microsoft.
'The Canadian personal computer hardware and software market is one of the
most advanced in the world.'
But being a Canadian personal computer hardware manufacturer is a tougher
business. Ask, for example, Benjamin K. Tam, president and chief executive
of Burnaby, British Columbia-based Darius Technology.
Tam has been making and selling personal computers in Canada for more than
six years, but admits that it is a tough market - particularly when many
Canadians can shop quite easily for US computers over the border.
Tam says that the recent Canada/US/Mexico North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) does not make this job any easier.
'In the Canadian market, we are affected by the economic situation of our
giant neighbour, the US, as well as by the agreements and government policy
of the Canadian government,' he says.
'Nafta could affect us severely in the high technology sector. Although we
are known to be strong in the telecommunications side, we are not at all
competitive (in the computer market) because the sheer volume is not there
in Canada.'
One solution has been to sell recently-developed products, including a
network file server system based on Digital Equipment's powerful Alpha AXP
computer processor, in both the US and Canada.
As a result, Tam now boasts that 22 per cent of his company's annual sales
are in the US, with the rest in Canada. And in the near future, he is
expanding to the Far East - a move becoming increasingly popular among
Western Canadian companies.
Tam recently signed a Dollars 1.5m joint venture agreement with a
state-owned enterprise in China. It will begin manufacturing computer
displays in Shanghai this summer. Tam says that these products are being
made for both the Far East and North American markets.
In short, while Canada has the resources and the talent to create
world-class high technology companies, it may have to move quite quickly to
sell products outside its borders if these talents are to survive.
With a domestic market of only slightly more than 25m people, spread over
thousands of miles, this is perhaps not surprising.
In terms of land mass, Canada is the second-largest country in the world -
and distribution costs can be high. But judging by the successes of Delrina
and the Ottawa-based Corel Corporation (developer of the popular Corel Draw
software and now owners of the Ventura Publisher desktop publishing
suite)Canadian companies can succeed on the world market.
The secret is to be there from day one.

Potentially large market in the longer term - Like so much pioneering
technology, the first generation of these small devices has largely failed
to meet user-expectations - but a wave of improved products is on the
horizon / Tom Foremski highlights advances in personal digital assistants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and personal communicators represent the
next big computer market, and for some industry observers, possibly the last
of the potentially large market categories for computers.
These small computer devices represent the logical progression of computer
technologies as they move from the desktop, to portable computers, to the
lap-top and finally to the so called palm-top. But like much pioneering
technology, the first generation of these devices have so far failed to meet
user expectations.
However, there are encouraging signs that the second generation of products
will overcome some of the problems.
Apple Computer was the first to coin the term 'PDA' which is rapidly turning
into a generic name for small computers with communications capabilities.
Tandy, which sells the Zoomer, sometimes uses the term 'personal information
assistant,' while IBM and ATT prefer the term 'personal communicator.'
They all describe a small computer that can be comfortably held in the hand
or slipped into a jacket pocket, with a touch-sensitive screen with a pen or
stylus input device and wireless communications capabilities for sending and
receiving electronic mail or faxes and transferring files to a desktop
computer.
A typical PDA will include software that consists of a word processor, a
diary for scheduling appointments, and a database to store information such
as phone numbers and addresses.
The first PDAs to hit the market were the Apple Newton MessagePad, Tandy's
Zoomer and ATT's Eo Communicator. Each has taken a slightly different
approach but all are united by the fact that their sales have been far short
of stellar.
The Newton MessagePad represents the most ambitious technology. It includes
sophisticated handwriting recognition software that turns the 'digital ink'
that is written by the user with a special stylus, into computer text. While
the handwriting recognition technology is state-of-the-art and works better
than most previous handwriting recognition technologies, its performance has
not impressed most users.
The handwriting recognition of the Newton fails to recognise many words,
resulting in a sometimes comical re-interpretation of the users words, as
satirised recently in the Doonesbury comic strip.
The Newton also has problems with foreign languages, especially German where
average word lengths are 10 characters instead of the six characters average
for English words. Newton has also been faulted for its communications links
which do not perform as well as expected.
The Tandy Zoomer, also marketed as the Z-7000 by Casio, has avoided, to a
large degree, the quagmire of handwriting recognition. It cannot recognise
cursive writing but it does have a very limited ability to recognise printed
characters. It prefers to store images of the user's notes instead of
performing the difficult handwriting interpretation.
The ATT Eo Personal Communicator packs more technology into its sleek box
than Newton or Zoomer, but it is twice the price. Unlike the others, it
includes a 20-megabyte hard drive that allows it to store much more
information. But it suffers from a short battery life - about two hours -
and you really need to upgrade the machine's memory to use its fax and
e-mail communications features.
All the leading PDAs have been criticised for being too slow and they all
use different operating systems which makes it difficult to produce a decent
number of software applications.
The Newton has its own proprietary operating systems, the Zoomer uses the
Geos software from GeoWorks, and the Eo device uses the PenPoint operating
system.
This multiplicity of operating systems makes life difficult for software
developers. They have to try to guess which device will sell enough units to
create a large enough potential market to justify the expense of
applications development. And without sufficient quantities of third-party
software, the PDAs face a limited appeal.
Despite the initial problems that have beset the first-generation PDAs, the
second generation devices promise improvements and new features that will
make them more useable and hopefully will fulfil the large unit sales
expectations of market researchers.
Apple, for example, is redesigning the Newton to add better communications
capabilities, and an improved operating system. Handwriting recognition is
also improved but, in what is an admission of a less-than-perfect system,
the next Newton will have the option to store images of a user's notes
without converting the handwriting to computer text.
ATT, stung by the disappointing sales of the Eo Communicator, is
redesigning the system, lowering the price and making it more of a mobile
telephone with computer features.
Other leading computer companies are also planning PDA introductions. Compaq
Computer, Motorola, IBM, and Sony are just a few of the big companies that
will introduce PDA-type devices later this year.
IBM's plans include a variety of PDAs designed for specific tasks, such as
one model equipped with voice recognition for dictating documents and using
a pen-input device for editing. Another IBM PDA is designed for e-mail
communications, allowing users to hear messages spoken in a
computer-generated voice and to dictate a response.
PDAs could benefit greatly from a standard user interface. General Magic, a
Silicon Valley-based company, earlier this year unveiled its Magic Cap user
interface which is specifically designed for PDA devices with communications
capabilities. The Magic Cap interface features a tiny graphical user
interface using a buildings metaphor. Users navigate through the systems to
reach different applications by choosing different types of buildings such
as a post office, for example, to send messages.
Magic Cap is designed to work with on-line services such as Compuserve or
AmericaOnline and specialised on-line services that use the companion
Telescript technology. Because of the small storage capabilities of PDAs,
on-line services are becoming a key factor in the success of PDAs. They will
offer data storage services to PDA customers and also carry e-mail and
faxes.
ATT recently announced its PersonaLink on-line service that will support
PDAs, and Apple's eWorld on-line service will support Newton users.
It is said that you can always recognise the pioneers by the arrows in their
backs and although the first generation of PDAs collected a fair number of
arrows, it is only a matter of time before the next generations become
ubiquitous and useful devices.

How automation cuts the invoice paper chase - Document image processing: two
case studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matching invoices to orders and goods-received documents tends not to be a
favourite job or a high priority for business people, writes John Kavanagh.
British Gas North Eastern, which has six districts and a Leeds headquarters
receiving 200,000 invoices a year from 8,000 suppliers, has automated the
paper chase with document image processing and has reaped considerable
benefit.
Paper movement has been drastically reduced, people holding up the process
have been pinpointed and cash flow has improved.
The paper chase used to involve an order document going to a supplier and a
copy being signed off as the goods-received note when the items arrived.
Invoices were sent to the finance department in Leeds, which passed them to
the relevant districts to be matched against the goods-received notes. These
notes and the invoices were then returned to Leeds for the details to be
keyed into the payments system. The documents were finally recorded on
microfilm.
Mrs Christine Kelly, invoice supervisor, recalls: 'There was paper flying
about everywhere.'
The invoice unit installed software from Image Systems Europe on its
existing office network of ICL personal computers and Novell network
software, which was already used for basic office automation such as word
processing and spreadsheet processing.
The PCs were fitted with large screens to display full images of documents
and two Fujitsu scanners and three Sony optical disc systems were added, all
supplied by Image Systems Europe. One of the optical disc drives is reserved
for copying each day's work, for back-up.
Goods-received notes and invoices are all scanned in as they are received
from districts and suppliers. The order number is keyed in and stored with
each document as the main reference point: an order number includes a code
representing the district which made the order.
The amounts on the invoice are also keyed in and put through a validation
program to ensure, for example, that the figures add up and that the VAT has
been calculated correctly.
This information has to be keyed in because document scanning systems handle
complete images and cannot recognise individual parts of different documents
to capture an address or total figure.
When the system receives an invoice it uses the order number to search for a
matching goods-received note. If it does not find one it automatically
directs a query to the relevant district office where staff can access the
central optical disc system through their own PCs.
Matched invoices are passed automatically to the payments system on the
region's ICL mainframe computer. The mainframe link is also used to retrieve
information such as supplier details from central files.
The system has brought significant staff savings and enabled fewer people to
deal with the same amount of work while providing better service. The paper
chase has been largely eliminated and keyboard data entry and verification
have been vastly reduced.
Cash flow has improved because more suppliers are paid on time. 'We no
longer pay them late - or early,' says Christine Kelly. 'Suppliers would
phone to ask for payment and it was difficult to find the right bits of
paper. We now have easy access to all the documents and can see if payment
is due.'
People's reluctance to check goods and sign goods-received notes was the
biggest problem before but the system has got to grips with this. 'It's
fantastic in this area,' Mrs Kelly says. 'Before, we knew we had queries but
couldn't keep track of them. We now know exactly where queries are and can
gee people up to act on them. We can now be proactive rather than reactive.'
Software details:
Product: Image Systems Europe tailors each document image and work flow
management system to the customer's needs. British Gas uses a version called
ISE Accounts Payable, which can match order documents to invoices and link
to accounts payable systems. A fax facility is available. The system was
launched in 1991. Number of users: six for ISE Accounts Payable: three
British Gas regions, Tesco, Top Rank and Woking Borough Council. The company
has 55 document and work flow management systems installed in the UK and
Europe.
Supplier: Image Systems Europe, formed as a UK company in Sheffield in 1990.
Turnover in 1993-94 was up by 48 per cent at Pounds 2.14m.
Price: Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000, including software, scanner and
optical disc system but excluding PCs and networks.
Hardware and operating systems: Novell networks, Unix computers and IBM-type
PCs running OS/2.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (21): A
better way to manage contracts - A simple document image processing system
installed by the pharmaceuticals company Medeva looks set for wider use
following quick installation and enthusiastic reports from staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medeva, the UK pharmaceutical manufacturer, has installed Archis software
from Belgian company Softcore to manage images of contracts, typically with
other manufacturers, licensees and distributors.
Medeva has installed a network of five Apple Macintosh computers at its
offices in Leatherhead, Surrey, partly to run Archis and partly to support
office automation such as word processing, spreadsheet processing and links
to the company's electronic mail system.
The entire stock of 930 agreements, running to 18,000 pages, has been
entered and all new agreements are scanned in immediately.
The paper contracts have always been kept in fire-proof cabinets and a list
was maintained through a simple database system based on the Dbase III
product.
People working on particular agreements would consult the holder of the
list, intellectual property co-ordinator Gail Beale, to see if there were
any other relevant documents, and then hunt them out in the filing cabinets.
All the documents are now on-line to all staff in the department.
'It could take hours to get through these steps and find files, especially
if you wanted, say, all the agreements relating to a particular company,'
says Mr Peter Cozens, head of licensing and product acquisition.
'The files were just stored in chronological order. We can now search on
many criteria, such as company name and therapeutic area, so we can easily
find the history of agreements in a particular field.
'The system has improved the information we have available and our ability
to respond to different situations.'
It took Gail Beale three months to scan-in all the documents and assign
keywords to each one. She and Peter Cozens agree that the system is very
easy to use. A 'find' screen is presented when a user logs-in and a search
is generated by entering the keywords.
Access is being extended to the company secretary's office in London and the
system has attracted the interest of other departments.
'We could turn out to be a pilot for the whole company in document image
processing,' says Gail Beale. 'It's a very impressive system and I could see
other parts of the company getting considerable benefits.'
Software details:
Archis, a document file management package combining document images, video
and data and text files from other systems. The latest version, 2.0, was
launched in September 1993. Price: Pounds 995.
Supplier: Softcore, the Belgian developer, formed in 1988. The UK subsidiary
was formed in Uxbridge, Middlesex, in 1992. It has 47 staff, including five
in the UK. Turnover in 1993 was Pounds 1.5m. Number of users: more than 200,
including more than 50 in the UK.
Hardware and operating systems: Apple Macintosh central processor; Macintosh
workstations or IBM-type PCs running Windows.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (19): An
expensive option for the foreseeable future - Systems integration / The
perceived demand for systems integration has attracted a growing number of
supplier and services companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many computer terms, systems integration is hard to define. At one
level, any computer-based information system must be integrated or it will
not work. But the term has come to refer to a particular class of computer
system - that is, one which is assembled from a set of components in a way
which hides the technology from the customer.
The importance of systems integration as a discipline has grown steadily
since companies began the move towards open systems. A system does not, of
course, need to be 'open' to require integration - but this is where the
largest demand is.
Proprietary systems are also 'integrated' - but most of the integration is
performed by the manufacturer and the system is sold as a complete solution.
Open systems bring the advantages of user choice and flexibility - but there
is a price to pay. They are constructed from hardware and software
'components' which are usually sourced from several different manufacturers.
They will almost certainly involve the use of a technological design
framework which separates systems functions into users and services. This
approach is usually referred to nowadays as client-server computing.
Advanced skills are a pre-requisite to bring these components together to
create coherent and useful applications. Systems integrators must have a
wide knowledge of 'componentry' and how it may be brought together
successfully.
They must also have strong software development skills because integrated
systems invariably require some 'custom-built' components to meet the
application need.
The perceived demand for systems integration has attracted a growing number
of supplier and services companies in the past two or three years.
Established hardware manufacturers in particular have seen systems
integration as a growth area as margins on hardware have fallen. IBM, DEC,
Groupe Bull, ICL and Unisys have emphasised their systems integration
talents in recent years and their service revenues have grown accordingly.
They are not the only contenders. Large consultancy companies such as EDS,
Andersen Consulting and KPMG have also made a large dent in the market as
indeed have traditional custom software developers such as Logica, SEMA and
CGS.
Successful systems integration depends on a broad foundation of standards
for both hardware connections and software compatibility.
Some standards are drawn from formal efforts by international standards
bodies such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
But many of the standards which make integrated systems possible have
evolved from proprietary industry standards such as IBM's SQL database
standard, which is used to link desktop data tools to database servers.
Given the importance of open systems standards, it is no surprise that the
lead in systems integration has come from the public sector.
The procurement policies of government departments have pushed the cause of
open systems and put many of them in the front line.
'The UK government's decision to force open systems by legislation has been
good for the systems integration market,' says Mr Philip Crawford, UK
managing director of Groupe Bull.
He goes on to say that there are other reasons why the demand for systems
integration has grown faster in the government sector than in the commercial
sector:
'For the last two years companies have been holding off making large
investment decisions because of the recession - and obviously the recession
hits commercial world much more than it hits the government sector.'
Mr Crawford adds that this has depressed the market - but that there are
signs that this is starting to change:
'The market has probably grown at around 15 per cent - when two years ago we
expected it to be more like 40 per cent. But it is now being driven by the
user. The demand for systems integration is coming from the user because
they are crying out for usable power.'
This demand is manifested in the demand to integrate desktop PCs into
existing systems. The PC is obviously the best way to deliver usable power
to the desktop.
Mr Crawford warns, however, that there are dangers:
'The PC is two different tools. If you think of it like a car - it is
excellent for driving around town but it is also pretty good on the
motorway. Good systems integration makes sure that the corporate strategy -
the motorway - does not overwhelm the desktop,' he explains.
Groupe Bull's systems integration strategy, like many others, is based on
developing the right combination of technical skills and relating these to
business problems.
It also sees the wisdom of securing alliances with other important players
in the market and recently signed an agreement with software developer
Microsoft to integrate PC software with its own larger systems.
'This is more than a marketing agreement. We have had to work hard to prove
to Microsoft that we have the integration skills and the support services to
do the job,' says Mr Crawford.
The deal will give Groupe Bull advanced access to important Microsoft
developments such as the Windows NT operating system, which looks set to be
a leading component in future client-server systems.
This level of software is increasingly important to the success of systems
integration as indeed is the move to object-oriented computing, which will
help to enforce standards for software components.
Despite this, systems integration will never be easy - especially as the
number of choices open to users increases.
'Users have developed an attitude which means that they expect information
technology to support them - whereas a few years ago they had to put up with
what they were given. But because of openness, there are far more decisions
to make now and it is certainly is not getting any the less complex,'
observes Mr Crawford.
Systems integrators are, therefore, in the unenviable position of having to
keep up with every new technology development at the same time as meeting
the growing demands of increasingly educated users.
For this reason, systems integration is likely to remain an expensive option
for the foreseeable future.

History often repeats itself - The UK's computing industry / The development
of the UK's computer manufacturing industry ran into problems from the
start.  Genius was let down by poor marketing and lack of government funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fujitsu's takeover of ICL in 1990 brought an end to a UK-owned computer
manufacturing industry which dated back almost 40 years.
Yet according to some of its early leaders, who met at London's Science
Museum at the end of last month to discuss why the early UK promise was not
fulfilled, the fact that the industry had survived even beyond the 1960s was
quite remarkable.
The packed meeting, organised by the Computer Conservation Society,
highlighted the UK's disadvantages from the very early days.
'The UK's contribution was out of all proportion to its population and
industrial capacity,' said Mr George Davis, who worked at the National
Physical Laboratory on the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).
'This was true at all stages: the creation of basic concepts, the research
and development leading to the first computers and the emergence of a
computer industry with competing suppliers.'
But Mr Davis argued that the breadth of this contribution meant that the UK
industry was too diverse from the start.
By the mid-1950s there were eight computer manufacturers. They included
Ferranti, English Electric, ICT (International Computers and Tabulators),
Elliott Brothers and Leo Computers - this last was the product of J. Lyons'
extraordinary expansion from tea shops into building computers.
Lyons is credited with being the first organisation to run commercial
applications. Notable among these were bakery production monitoring in 1951
and payroll in 1954. These landmarks inspired The Economist to publish a
feature article in 1954 which asked: 'Is this the first step in an
accounting revolution or merely an interesting and expensive experiment?'
The trouble was that the US, with a similar number of manufacturers, had a
far bigger home market on which to build the foundations for its industry -
and more government support.
'While the US government was supporting research and development in the late
1940s and early 1950s, with guaranteed orders at the end, the computer
industry was not seen as significant in the UK and was not supported,'
George Davis told the Computer Conservation Society.
This was underlined by the practical experiences of Mr Cecil Marks, who
recalled being seconded by Royal Ordnance, where he worked on administration
and accounting, using punched card equipment, to a study carried out by
government departments into the potential uses of computers. Scientists and
users from several departments, including the Treasury, worked for 18
months, culminating in the production of a hefty report and a meeting with
'a very senior civil servant.'
'At the end of the meeting he suggested that this was not the time to be
getting into computers,' Mr Marks said. 'That led to the ordnance factories,
at least, losing ground for more than 10 years.'
Other factors were brought to light by Mr Hugh Ross, who set up Ferranti's
London computer centre in the mid-1950s. He pointed to a dispute between
Ferranti and the National Research Development Corporation, over
manufacturing costs underwritten by the publicly-funded corporation, which
led to a nine-month ban on sales. As Mr Ross said, this had a 'crippling'
impact on UK success in the emerging market, as well as hitting Ferranti's
cash flow.
But Mr Ross also blamed an absence of financial management for Ferranti's
failure to fulfil its early promise. Even when he set up the London computer
centre, he said, he never had to account for any money he spent - indeed, he
had never had a budget in the first place.
Later, when he was responsible for Ferranti's pioneering documentation
service, one of the biggest spending units, Mr Ross again had no budget.
Moreover, he had never had to produce a business plan and was never called
to account. 'There was no financial management at all,' he said.
'I later joined STC and came in contact with management training provided by
its owner, the US ITT group,' Mr Ross added. 'This was terrific - and a
profound shock, after Ferranti. We had to produce business plans, prepare
budgets and report our monthly results against those budgets.'
Such personal reminiscences add flesh to historians' reports on UK genius
being let down by everything from poor marketing to lack of government
funding, compared with the US, France and Germany.
Whatever the combination of factors, George Davis showed how US
manufacturers took firm control within a dozen years of J. Lyons running
that first payroll system.
By 1967, IBM had installed over 21,500 computers of various sizes; UK market
leader ICT (soon to become ICL) had sold 844. These included 399 of the new
1900 range (which was to be the company's mainstay until the middle of the
1970s); meanwhile, IBM's System 360, launched the same year, was already up
to 5,730 installations.
In 1968, ICL was formed as the great white hope: the culmination of merging
the computing activities of all the early manufacturers. Yet it was still
dwarfed by IBM: George Davis showed that in 1969 ICL had a Pounds 115m
turnover and spent Pounds 13m on research and development, while IBM had a
turnover of Pounds 3,000m and a research budget of almost Pounds 170m.
However, a retired ICL executive director, Mr Peter Hall, stoutly defended
ICL's record. ICL and its ICT forerunner had been profitable for 35 years -
apart from in 1965, just after taking over Ferranti's ailing computing
operation; and in 1981, when the visionary Dr Robb Wilmot was transforming
the company for the emerging office computing revolution.
Mr Hall said Fujitsu allowed ICL to run itself, and that the company
generated all its own cash for takeovers and other investment, and did all
its own design work.
Whether that makes ICL any more British than IBM UK (or Rover Group in the
car industry, for that matter) is debatable. But Mr Hall argued that these
points suggest that the early promise of the UK computer manufacturing
industry, which had mostly merged into ICL by 1969, was fulfilled after all.
It is simply that a generation later the industry is all in foreign hands.
As today's tight margins on hardware increasingly cause computer
manufacturers to look to software and services for their profits, it is
equally debatable whether the virtual disappearance of a UK computer
manufacturing industry need be a cause for concern.
That concern is now focused more on the software industry, where some big
names have fallen into foreign ownership. Takeovers of Cap, Hoskyns, Istel,
Scicon and others have given substantial footholds in the UK market to, for
example, the telecoms giant ATT, General Motors' EDS subsidiary and the
French company CGS, Europe's biggest computing services group.
History, as they say, has a habit of repeating itself.
The Computer Conservation Society has regular meetings and works on
restoring ancient computers. It is also opening Bletchley Park (which
cracked German codes in the Second World War) for public visits. The
secretary is Tony Sale, (0234) 822788.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (16): A
radical change in culture - Case study, two companies break new ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Facilities management agreement between BP Exploration Europe (BPXEU) in
Aberdeen, and Andersen Consulting, broke new ground for both companies. In
effect, BPXEU outsourced not only the IT department and the accounting
software it had used, but the actual accounting function and staff as well.
The decision, taken in the early 1990s, affected the entire accounting
services of the UK and the Continental Shelf operations - a Pounds 12bn
business worldwide, employing some 7,000 people. Another unusual aspect was
the extreme secrecy of the arrangements: the 300 accounting staff affected
were not told until after months of negotiations and hammering out details
of the facilities management (FM) contract.
The driving force for BP Exploration towards facilities management was the
need to cut down all expenses by 30 per cent. Tom Wright, control and
planning manager at BPXEU , explains the pressures brought about by the
collapse of oil prices since the early 1980s - 'we realised we would have to
radically alter the way we did business to remain competitive. We had to
reduce costs 30 per cent across the board,' he says. 'It was a requirement
for every manager to achieve that within three years without compromising
health and safety.'
The core skill for BPXEU was its business of oil exploration, and a hard
look at the accounting services revealed that a line could be drawn between
what accounting information was truly necessary in-house, and what was not.
'It is vital that we have that information, for making policy and
interpreting business information, but not that we provide it ourselves,'
says Mr Wright.
'Similar styles' is the reason he gives for the choice of Andersen
Consulting, which already had a track record at BPXEU. When news of the
announcement broke in June, it was a brand new idea for both companies.
Andersen was to take over accounting staff as well as IT staff and computer
assets.
'Initially there was shock, even anger. However we had prepared pre-planned,
individual, intensive counselling sessions, and by the end of the day,
people understood the effect it was going to have. We though that was better
than months of uncertainty,' says Wright.
The business was transferred under transfer of undertaking legislation,
which protects the employees and their rights. Effectively they had no
choice, although for some, the centralisation of operations in Aberdeen,
from the six sites previously involved, pre-determined the decision.
'Everyone outside Aberdeen had a choice of relocation to new location or
accepting severance terms,' says Tom Wright. 'They were transferred - full
stop. There was no choice.'
Andersen took over the staff, the Vax computer and McCormack and Dodge (now
Dun  Bradstreet) Millennium software used for the accounts. Wright himself
has no doubts that the deal arranged for BPXEU accounting staff actually
secured better career prospects and long-term employment.
'Andersen Consulting provides greater focus and incentive for the staff who
feel far closer to the business. If an accountant works for an accountancy
company, it is the focus of using the core skills in the core business that
drives the difference. No one believes that on 'day one,' of course, but
after six or seven months that is exactly what has happened.'
The pension rights were the only thing that had to be addressed - in some
cases 'topped up' to match the BP scheme for those transferring to the
Andersen pension scheme.
'The key benefits are the enthusiasm and the focus of the staff. It has
reduced costs by creating a single interface, instead of a myriad of
interfaces,' says Mr Wright. 'The real effect is that we have turned a fixed
cost to a variable, or at least semi-variable cost. As the service expands -
say, drilling increases or new fields come online, or we dispose of other
assets - so the cost varies. Now we can concentrate on the core business,
and it allows us to focus on the business of exploration and production. It
has simplified things. We don't have to worry about training, developing and
motivating 300 accounting and support staff.'
However, there has been no abdication of decision-making. 'We take all the
business decisions. They provide the financial analysis and variants
analysis, but they don't decide what should be done: the decision-making is
the core skill.' says Mr Wright. He believes the physical distance of the
Andersen operation, five miles away, was essential to bring about a change
of culture.
The initial contract is for four years: both parties reckon on three years
to get the costs down, although a longer partnership is envisaged.
'It's an opportunity to share benefits: if Andersen can grow the business,
they can bring the cost down. They have the focus to do it faster and more
efficiently. The other thing I'd emphasise is that we really did want the
best for our staff. We honestly believed they would have a better future
than in a business where the cost pressures of the North Sea were a constant
threat,' he adds.
The FM contract has had one more important psychological effect, he says.
'More than anything else, the move convinced everybody else inside BP that
we are serious about changing the way we do business.'
For Andersen, the business has grown as expected. It took 317 staff from
BPXEU, only 30 of them computer-based. 'That's what makes this deal so
unusual: it's a business function management, not just systems management,'
says Norman Cook, Andersen's associate partner, the head of the unit at
Aberdeen.
It now has extra customers, including Sun Oil in Aberdeen. Cook's view is
that Andersen's expertise has already brought savings. He is confident that
the current costs of Pounds 15m per year can be brought down by Pounds 5m by
1995 - 'we've saved a lot because we manage the bank balance tightly: Pounds
500,000 a year in funding charges alone.'
Bill Lattimer, partner in charge of market development for the outsourcing
practice at Andersen Consulting, believes this is the way FM is going - 'the
IT component is of less interest to the customer: it's not the important
element in Aberdeen. The way we have developed the people is important. We
have taken an organisation, a process, and completely redefined the way the
service operates and the way it interacts with its customers. The
value-added service we're providing is our skills in service definition and
management.'

Customer-driven approach - Facilities management, the supplier's viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starting a facilities management company might seem a radical departure for
Bull Information Systems, but when Athesa, its new facilities management
(FM) division, was launched in February, Philip Crawford, the chief
executive, insisted that the new company was no departure but a logical
evolution from the role that Bull has long held with its customers, writes
Claire Gooding.
Mr Crawford sees FM as an international opportunity - 'the use of partners
to offer a full range of services in the outsourcing arena will be a growing
trend. We can draw on facilities in 28 countries,' he says.
The company is experienced in changing its role as the computer industry has
evolved. Its primary markets - healthcare, police and local government - are
among those most drastically affected by the demands of cost- cutting and
compulsory competitive tendering.
According to Athesa director, Brian Gunn, the move is customer-driven - 'we
are focusing to deliver a range of services, from under one roof. In the
last 12 months customers, especially in local government, have been asking
us what we are doing in FM.'
Bull has used partnerships of various sorts as the platform for its own
sundry changes of direction. As part of its adjustment to Open Systems, it
has developed strong links with software vendors and value-added resellers.
In the past Bull has done well as the prime bidder in single-source
contracts, with clients who are comfortable with the 'one bottom to kick'
principle.
The key to success, he believes, is flexibility in the use of staff. There
is a core of 60 Athesa staff in the division, but he intends to treat the
rest of Bull as on call. At one client, Glaxo, Athesa is providing a desktop
service where it is installing, maintaining and supporting PCs, LANs, and
Unix servers, not only in the UK, but in 26 countries worldwide. The
contract has been worth Pounds 2.4m since it began in 1992, and is expected
to be renewed at the end of its current period in 1994.
'We can bring our skills to the fore in forging new partnerships. There is a
range of skills and complementary expertise we can draw on. Perhaps those
skills are not unique in themselves, but what is unusual is that we can pull
it all together,' says Gunn.
Development and systems integration are complementary to Athesa's plans.
Bull's Systems Integration section will provide the experts who are needed
on projects needed, for any period from a week to two or three years. Athesa
will provide the long-term support for operations and applications support,
and management of IT. Bull's plans are standard in this area, involving the
takeover of staff and assets. 'We have the resources on tap, they get the
career opportunities,' says Mr Gunn.
Athesa's sister company, the People Plus head-hunters, are part of the
partnership. In one sense, Gunn argues, the source of supply is the
cornerstone of the business. There has always been a division in programming
between those who develop and those who maintain software.
While this distinction has been largely broken down by the increased use of
software packages, and the availability of fourth generation languages,
there will be times when the aristocrats of development will be needed on a
short-term basis.
In concentrating on the desktop delivery, Bull is not alone. Desktop and the
network have become more important, Supporting legacy systems is bread and
butter, but the market is heading towards improving, not merely maintaining
operations.
'It is in the area of business operations that the opportunities of
cost-benefits are to be achieved', comments Mr Gunn.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (15): A
make-or-break factor - Facilities management / In the term 'computer
services,' emphasis is shifting away from computers and towards services.
That is one reason why companies once dedicated to hardware or software are
moving into facilities management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING

<TEXT>
The ability of a company to operate - or not - may depend on the management
of its computer system. This can be the 'make-or-break' factor, especially
as computers move close to the centre of business in areas such as
manufacturing, customer service and sales, as well as the traditional
accounting functions.
On this premise both factions on facilities management (FM) base their
arguments. The faction 'against' believes the computer system is so vital to
the competitive strength of core activities that it would be madness to
contract it out. Inside knowledge - expertise about computing, and the
business - should stay that way.
The argument about being in the centre of things hands equal ammunition to
those who promote FM. In a culture where compulsory competitive tendering
(CCT) is the norm, there are economies of scale in an outside (or
'outsourced') supplier providing the hardware, the software, and the
expertise to support it.
CCT demands that every contract decision must involve those classic
elements, 'measure and deliver' - dear to the heart of IT professionals. You
can't deliver what you can't measure. Furthermore, FM proponents argue that
they are much better at knowing how much things should cost, where economies
can be made, and delivering them, undistracted by the fluctuating concerns
of core operations.
Coding, programming and the support of end users are the central activities
of an IT department. The argument runs thus: how much better for individuals
to be at the profit making centre of a company whose business is supplying
IT services, than to be at the periphery of a company whose real raison
d'etre is baking biscuits, making cars, or exploring for oil.
It has to be said, on both sides, that the margins in supplying computer
hardware and even packaged software have dwindled. However, the
long-accepted figure of '80 per cent of IT spending is on support and
maintenance' stays constant. The tedium of arguing about who owns a problem
(software, hardware, network?) has driven many a user-company into
single-source-supplier agreements, and the idea of contracting out an entire
IT department is simply a logical step further in cost control.
The result is a burgeoning market in 'systems integration' and 'facilities
management' - new names for bundling activities, familiar since the earliest
days of computer services.
Systems integration is a broad church. It covers anything to do with
development - including every sort of alliance of software and hardware
involved in setting up new systems. FM is the contracting out of an entire
task and its maintenance - the contractors take over the assets and the
manpower necessary to the service.
The research company Dataquest estimates the value of the FM marketplace at
more than Dollars 2,500m in Europe, growing by 20 per cent a year. This
explains why some of the best-known names in the computer industry are now
turning to FM as a core activity.
They include the big, traditional firms of accountants such as Andersen
Consulting and Ernst and Young, and names once identified with
manufacturing, rather than merely supporting computers. Unisys and Olivetti,
for example, are among the companies which, once known for their proprietary
hardware, have turned to supplying services and support for almost any sort
of hardware and software, particularly the workstations and PCs termed
'desktop services'.
Nearly 1,000 of Olivetti UK's 1,400 employees are in the Customer Support
Group, working for a customer base largely in the financial and retail
sector. Unisys has recently signed up Bass Taverns, the UK's largest public
house retailer, for an FM contract worth over Pounds 3.9m over three years.
Its job is to support 2,500 pubs, developing and supporting Bass's Central
Retail System.
In the UK, other users of Unisys' outsourcing services include McDonald's
Restaurants. US users include the federal government, the Ford Motor
Company, and Nasa.
Hoskyns is an active FM company, one of the UK's largest computer services
companies, worth Pounds 200m, part of the French-owned Cap Gemeni Sogeti
Group. UK customers include Woolworths, Bristol Water, and Hoover -
'outsourcing is still the fastest-growing sector of the IT services market.
Analysts estimate that the European market will double by 1998 to a value of
Pounds 4bn,' says Peter Falconer, Hoskyns' associate director.
Falconer is looking to the European market to expand. Five recent contracts
for Hoskyns' Scandinavian sister company, adding up to Pounds 17m worth in
all, underline the ambition. 'The pace at which FM is adopted will differ
country by country,' he says. 'CGS is well placed to benefit from this
expansion, because it is committed to regional as well as global service
delivery.'
He argues that in-house IT departments find it difficult to keep pace with
the growing demands of the organisations they serve, and the increasing
complexity of PCs and LANs is putting more strain on them.
According to a 1993 survey by Romtec, desktop services (PCs, their
procurement, installation, configuration and support) is the fastest-growing
part of FM - worth over Pounds 1bn by 1995. Asset management, network
design, installation and administration, and the end-user helpdesk, all come
under the 'desktop' label. The desktop is one of the prime areas targeted by
Bull Information Systems, the newest arrival in the FM market, which
launched its Athesa FM division this February (see below).
Sharing the benefits of cost-saving is a convincing argument for FM, but
there is always concern about staff who have to change allegiance to the
'outsourced' supplier. (See panel on Andersen's BP contract for an example).
There are regulations to protect them: the Transfer of Undertakings
Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 retains current terms and
conditions for staff being transferred.
The government is anxious to remove obstacles to free market testing.
According to the William Waldegrave, the minister for public service and
science, speaking at a recent Financial Times conference on resource
management, 'The relevant provisions of the Deregulation and Contracting-Out
Bill, now before Parliament, are designed to extend the scope for market
testing activities in central and local government by removing obstacles to
the contracting-out of statutory functions.' This is good news for Athesa
and others - but staff affected might not be so pleased.
Unison, the UK's biggest trade union, and CMS, a division of British Steel,
claimed to have broken new ground when they recently signed a trade union
agreement which outlined practices and procedures to be followed when staff
transferred from Cambridge City Council to CMS, a division of British Steel,
which won the multi-million pound contract in late 1993. According to Mark
Pope, CMS sales and marketing manager, this was an important 'industry
first'.
'We believe it is important that our new staff have confidence in us, and we
in them.' The Unison office at Cambridge City Council stressed the
importance of contractors recognising unions. 'If we are to be subject to
the contracting out of services from local authorities, then it is important
that any successful contractor recognises unions: CMS was the only candidate
that had any track record of successful relationships with Unions.'
This is a hint that the change of culture associated with working for one
organisation rather than another might bring new patterns to the computer
industry. 'Partnership' - the key word emphasised by all FM suppliers -
means both partners making allowances if the marriage is to last.

Watchword for the future - Global mobile communications / Paul Quigley
charts the rapid progress towards a mobile millenium in communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL QUIGLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Mind the gap]' warns a familiar, faceless voice to travellers on the London
Underground. This could well be the watchword for the future of global
mobile communications as a radical revolution takes place.
The 'gap' in this case is 'globalisation and personalisation' - the main
themes of the wireless age.
Few of us could have predicted the all-pervasive influence which personal
computers would come to have in business and personal life over the last
decade. Yet we are seeing the integration of voice, data, image, and
communications in a natural evolution towards the multimedia workstation.
Similarly, emerging technologies in mobile communications have catapulted
wireless, mobile and personal communications into one of the fastest growing
markets in the world. The range of technologies becoming available is
immense. Many people know about and use cellular telephones and radiopagers.
Others are aware of mobile data and digital cordless technologies. Plans are
well under way for future wireless and mobile communications systems which
will obfuscate the demarcation lines between wireless and fixed
telecommunications.
First generation cellular technologies - those in use today - are
predominantly analogue systems such as AMPS (American Mobile Phone System),
TACS (Total Access Communication System) and NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone)
systems.
Radiopaging has been dominated by the POCSAG (Post Office Code Standards
Advisory Group) system. Second generation mobile technologies are now
becoming commercially available, introducing digital architectures to mobile
communications. These include GSM, CT2, DECT, CDMA and the lesser-known
IS-54 and PDC.
The speed of developments in the mobile industry accelerates apace. For
example, it took cellular phone manufacturers eight hours to make a cellular
phone in 1988; 30 minutes in 1992. Today it takes a mere 12 minutes - and
this is a telephone containing computer capacity of between 30m and 40m
instructions per second, equivalent to the power of mainframes of only a few
years ago.
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is in the limelight around the
world. Developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI), the technical standards body, GSM is the first harmonised European
standard to catch the imagination and the investment of users, operators,
and manufacturers alike.
GSM was developed as a pan-European digital cellular radio network
architecture; it has evolved over more than 10 years into the standard we
see today. Set to grow at an unprecedented rate over the next five years,
GSM is already far more than merely a European standard. Already it has been
adopted as the preferred choice of international mobile network operators in
countries as diverse as Australia, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Hong
Kong, China, India, Pakistan, and the Gulf states.
A report entitled 'GSM - Going Global', by consultancy Nexus Market
Analysis, forecasts that there will be 40m GSM users by the year 2002 in
Europe alone. Driven by falling handset prices, competitive tariffs and
wider network coverage, the market is growing at a phenomenal rate. The
international roaming capability of GSM, coupled with the phase two
supplementary service enhancements such as data communications and fax, is
making GSM a serious contender as the benchmark for future global mobile
systems.
DCS1800, a digital cellular standard based on the GSM specification for
lower power handsets, points to the future in the wireless market. Operating
in the 1.8 GHz band width, DCS1800 is intended for use as a mass market
personal communications network, or PCN.
With a design philosophy quite distinct from its forbears, the key to the
PCN market will be simplicity and ease of use. The target market for the
'personal communicator' is you and me.
In the UK there are two licensed PCN operators. Germany has licensed one
DCS1800 operator; so has Thailand. France is in the process of licensing a
DCS1800 operator and others are sure to follow. There is growing speculation
that US telecom regulators will grant Personal Communications Services (PCS)
licences to operators touting DCS at 1900 MHz.
Cordless technologies such as CT2 (second generation digital cordless
telephony) and DECT (Digital European Cordless Telecoms) are also reviving
the industry. CT2 has recently experienced mixed fortunes around the world.
The failure of CT2 as a public telepoint technology in the UK made many
people think it was a dead-duck digital technology. However, mass uptake of
CT2 in Hong Kong, France and elsewhere has forced a re-evaluation of its
future. (The advent of the DECT standard may have somewhat dampened this, as
DECT has found converts in the cordless PABX arena, the wireless local area
network (WLAN) market and even in the wireless local loop market.)
In radiopaging, developments in memory capacity, functionality and coverage
are vying to re-establish this elder statesman of mobile communications as a
flexible and feature-rich medium.
'Wireless Messaging' is the term used by many people in the industry for
radiopaging. ERMES (European Radio Messaging), the ETSI standard for digital
paging, is taking longer than expected to launch. Third generation systems
are already on the drawing board, with concepts such as 'Future Public Land
Mobile Telecommunications System' (FPLMTS), 'Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System' (UMTS) and 'Universal Personal
Telecommunications' (UPT) already well under development.
The backbone of these third generation systems will be Intelligent Networks
(Ins) which will enable users to rely on the intelligence in the digital
network to handle the mechanics and logistics of routeing, storing and
forwarding of data.
Competition in Europe and across the world has driven the market -
competition not only in handsets and equipment manufacture, but especially
between network operators. At a recent IBC conference on Pan-European
Digital Cellular Radio in Athens, GSM was seen as the de facto global
standard.
Yet, despite GSM's runaway international success, there is a continuing
debate within the industry over the future air interface of digital cellular
systems. GSM, DCS1800, DECT, and others use TDMA (Time Division Multiple
Access), which breaks up speech channels into multiple time slots. Over the
last few years the industry has been rocked by an alternative digital air
interface: CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), a spread-spectrum
technology making better use of available frequencies.
As we hurtle headlong towards a new mobile millennium, a blurring of the
edges in place-to-place and person-to-person communications will give rise
to wholesale change. We're going global in a wireless world. Mind the gap]

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (13): A
tricky balancing act for leading vendors - Telecom equipment suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is substantial uncertainty in the international market for public
telecommunications 'which is characterised by lower investment and
intensifying price competition particularly in the major industrialised
countries' - this was the gloomy prognosis for telecom equipment suppliers,
given by the Swedish manufacturer Ericsson, during its 1993 results meeting.
Five years ago this kind of outlook would have been deeply damaging for a
company like Ericsson. In common with its rivals in Europe - Alcatel and
Siemens - Ericsson placed a heavy reliance on the sale of switching
equipment to state-owned telephone companies in western Europe.
But Ericsson's focus has changed over the last two to three years. Mobile
communications is now its core business. And while Europe remains an
important market for sales of switching equipment, Ericsson is increasingly
tapping emerging markets such as India and China for new sales.
The telecom equipment market today is undergoing rapid change both in terms
of the products that are manufactured and the markets where they are sold.
Big business users are demanding high-speed broadband services to send
massive volumes of data backwards and forwards between their offices
scattered across the world. Radio is becoming the cheaper than copper for
access to long-distance networks. And the term 'multimedia' is causing panic
among equipment vendors. They will undoubtedly play a role in building
multimedia networks.
But software is the key to multimedia and if equipment vendors fail to reach
alliances with software companies, they may be left behind. The leading
equipment suppliers such as Alcatel, Siemens, American Telephone and
Telegraph and Northern Telecom are still making public switches.
But most state-owned telephone companies in western Europe and North America
are now reducing their investment levels. They have digitalised their
long-distance networks and modernisation of local networks for low-spending
residential customers is proceeding at a slower rate. Recession - first in
North America and now in Europe - has also taken its toll.
Increasingly, switch suppliers are targetting the emerging Asian markets.
China is the biggest prize and its requirements are so immense that there is
room for all suppliers. Ian Macleod, a telecommunications analyst at Natwest
Sellier in Paris, calculates that in 1992, total line deliveries (switch
orders are expressed in terms of the number of lines that can be connected)
to China came to around four million.
He estimates that the figure doubled to eight million in 1993, and that by
1996, orders could be running at 12m lines a year. To raise telephone
penetration to its planned level of 10 per cent by the end of the decade,
China will have to buy 100m lines between 1992 and 2000.
India's expansion programme will require the installation of 18m lines over
the same period. Major suppliers to Asia such as Alcatel and Ericsson are
gradually moving manufacturing facilities into local markets. There are
clear benefits to be had.
Production costs are lower than in Europe or North America. But this is not
the prime motivating factor. In many cases, governments insist on local
manufacture to provide jobs and prepare the way for indigenous production.
Some governments in eastern Europe make the acquisition of local production
facilities a pre-condition of contract awards. Otherwise, the local
manufacturers which supplied the national telephone companies during the
Cold War would inevitably face closure.
But it would be a mistake to imagine that western manufacturers are packing
their bags and heading east. Sales into developing markets are more of an
expansion than a re-orientation.
The riches are still in Western Europe and North America, although the
importance of public switching equipment is inevitably in decline. Alcatel,
the world's largest telecom equipment manufacturer, still relies on Europe
for 75 per cent of its sales.
Driven by a wave of liberalisation, the European telecommunications
equipment market will undergo radical change over coming years. The cosy
relationship between state-owned telephone companies and local manufacturers
will be forced apart as new operators attack the lucrative international and
business communications markets.
Closed markets will open as state-owned telephone companies begin to behave
like proper commercially-run companies. And national champions such as
Siemens and Alcatel will respond by selling their products to competitors to
Deutsche Telekom and France Telekom.
The UK telecommunications market is already the most liberalised in the
world.
Equipment manufacturers are widening their vision beyond BT and Mercury
Communications, and are facing immense pressure from both the new operators
and the incumbents to develop new technology that gives them a competitive
edge.
New international and long-distance telephone networks are being built,
wireless technology is being trialled for local telephone networks, and
cable television operators are being allowed to offer telephone services.
The requirements of big business users are setting the agenda for equipment
vendors. Coping with massive flows of data between sites has become a
headache for today's telecommunications manager.
A surge in demand for the interconnection of local computer-based networks
has led to the development of a fast packet-switching service for data
communications called frame relay.
Equipment vendors are facing stiff competition in frame relay from smaller
companies in the computer and networking sectors such as Cisco Systems,
Raycom Systems and StrataCom.
A bigger battle is being fought for dominance in Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM), a technique for sharing the capacity of a telecoms channel between
those wishing to use it. ATM enables telephone operators to offer high
bandwidth services, such as high-speed data or video-conferencing, with
improved efficiency and greater flexibility.
ATM is already being touted as the backbone for multimedia and other
broadband services, and can be applied to both private and public networks.
All leading equipment vendors are positioning themselves for a share of the
ATM market. A group of 16 European operators in 15 countries is to conduct
an ATM trial this year, and all have awarded ATM contracts.
Familiar names such as Alcatel, Siemens, American Telephone and Telegraph
and Ericsson have won contracts along with Netcomm, a UK-based data switch
manufacturer.
Ericsson has prospered as a leading telecommunications equipment
manufacturer in a market which is undergoing rapid technological and where a
number of its rivals are stumbling. Alcatel, Siemens and Northern Telecom
all suffered profit setbacks in 1993.
They were hit by a fall in orders for public telecommunications equipment as
a result of the recession in North America and Europe. Meanwhile, products
based on ATM, and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, its sister transmission
technology, are only now emerging from the laboratory and operators are
reluctant to commit themselves to major orders.
Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson's managing director, puts his company's strong
financial performance in 1993 down to a strategy which meant spending 15
times more on RD than on dividends.
In a speech at the 1994 Innovation Lecture in London last month, Ramqvist
said manufacturers needed to forego short-term profit in favour of higher
RD spending.
Ian Macleod at Natwest Sellier is confident that the combination of
liberalisation and new technologies 'promises a new phase of growth in the
world telecommunications equipment market.'
Leading equipment vendors are best-placed to benefit from the growth. But
they will have to get the balance right between selling old products into
new markets, and bringing out new products for their older customers in
Europe and North America.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (12): A
global scramble for partners - The big telecom operators / The emergence of
global service providers able to meet the needs of multinational
corporations is being slowed by a range of cultural and technical problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Telecommunications giants are stumbling towards global alliances which will
bring down national barriers and sideline second-division telephone
companies.
The telecommunications big boys say alliances are a response to the
communications needs of multinational corporations, but, at times, it seems
as though the customers are the sideshow, and the main event is a showdown
between telephone operators determined to outmanoeuvre each other.
BT carries much of the responsibility for the high levels of activity among
the world's largest telephone operators over the last three years. It tried
to set up an exclusive partnership with Deutsche Telekom and Nippon
Telephone and Telegraph in 1991. This fell apart after Deutsche Telekom
insisted on including its French allies, NTT got cold feet, and both the
Japanese and the Europeans realised that their competition authorities might
not think a joint venture company intent on exercising global competitive
strength was a good idea.
In fairness to BT, it saw a market emerging for the provision of global
communications services, and this has been the motivation behind its
attempts to put together worldwide alliances. Many other companies, despite
their claims, would be happy to keep the status quo and to exclude BT from
their markets.
Events have moved on since 1991: BT has taken a 20-per-cent stake in MCI,
the second largest US long-distance telephone company, and the two companies
are setting up a new company dedicated exclusively to selling services to
multinational corporations; France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have set up
a joint venture company of their own; three second-tier European telephone
operators, PTT Telecom Netherlands, Telia of Sweden, and Switzerland's PTT
Telecom have set up a venture called Unisource; and American Telephone and
Telegraph has also announced a world strategy of its own.
Brokers in the global power game will emerge from these four groupings, but
the next few years will see a jockeying for position among the global
communications protagonists and the expansion of existing partnerships.
Other telecommunications companies waiting on the sidelines are US
long-distance operator, Sprint, Japanese operators, KDI and NTT, Cable 
Wireless, Spain's Telefonica and Telecom Italia, the group that will emerge
from the restructuring of Italy's telecommunications services sector, but
they will face a number of obstacles along the way which will slow the
progress of global partnerships. The main ones are:
US partners: most multinational corporations are headquartered in the US.
The idea of a global communications company is that it can deliver services
in all of those countries where multinational companies have offices.
A presence in the US, therefore, is vital. Two of the groupings, Unisource
and France Telecom/Deutsche Telekom need US partners. ATT, MCI and Sprint
are the three obvious candidates for anyone in search of a US partner.
MCI has already thrown in its lot with BT, so this only leaves ATT and
Sprint. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom were in serious discussions with
ATT last year with a view to an alliance that would have involved a pooling
of international telecommunications activities in a new company but Project
Atlantic has broken down following suggestions from the competition
authorities in Brussels that it would fall foul of rules on mergers. A
less-ambitious alliance is now under discussion, but this may not satisfy
the ambitions of ATT.
Unisource appeared to be lining up Sprint two years ago when the two sides
agreed to interconnect their data communications networks, but the agreement
was terminated at the end of last year after Unisource lost one of its first
customers, Swedish conglomerate, SKF Group, because of problems with the
interconnection of the two networks.
Systems integration: telecommunications networks are constructed in
different ways and by different manufacturers. When SKF Group cancelled its
contract with Unisource, it cited the failure of Unisource and Sprint to
provide seamless network integration.
Systems integration will be one of the main tasks facing BT and MCI when
they construct a global network platform. Customers in the US will connect
on to MCI's network, while BT is installing network facilities in Europe.
Old friends: partnerships already exist between international telephone
operators. When a UK company orders an international private circuit from
BT, for example, from London to Paris, BT has to liaise with France Telecom
for the half-circuit on the French side. Similarly, international telephone
operators have to pay each other for delivering calls to their customers.
Accounts are settled according to the international settlements procedure.
Complications arise when a country has more than one international operator.
For example, the UK has BT and Mercury, while the US has three large
international carriers, ATT, MCI and Sprint.
In this case, BT would divide its international outgoing traffic between the
US operators according to the market share of the three operators for
international calls from the US.
ATT has roughly 60 per cent of the US long-distance market, so it receives
60 per cent of all incoming calls. This business is highly lucrative as the
settlements procedure sets prices at above cost. If ATT was to side against
large international operators, it could threaten existing relationships.
This explains why ATT says it would prefer to offer global services in
partnership with state-owned telephone companies rather than in competition
with them.
Regulation: few countries allow competition with state-owned telephone
operators in basic voice telephone services. In Europe, restrictions will
not be removed until 1998, although many companies are already exploiting
uncertainties about the rules for competition in services to closed user
groups. Global alliances will also attract scrutiny from both national and
regional governmental bodies.
BT's acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in MCI had to go before the the US
State Department and Department of Justice, as well as the Federal
Communications Commission, the telecommunications regulatory authority. It
also needed clearance from the European Commission.
An alliance between ATT, France Telecom and Deutshce Telekom would face
even closer scrutiny, and is the main reason for the decision of the three
operators to seek a less-ambitious alliance than was originally envisaged.
Outsourcing: global alliances are founded on the assumption that
multinational corporations will, over the next few years, decide to
outsource their telecommunications networks to third parties. But Mr Lenny
Elefenbein, the managing director of US telecommunications consultancy, Lynx
Technologies, notes that 'while an impressive number of users have put out
requests for information, very few have actually awarded their businesses to
one of the carriers.'
He says that even the large carriers have been confused by the high ratio of
activity to closed deals and that several of them have commissioned internal
studies to determine 'why they they are not getting their share of the
perceived big outsourcing bonanza.'
Cultures: while MCI is an aggressive, marketing-driven company, BT is still
making the transition from a government department nine years after its
privatisation and ten years after the ending of its monopoly. Many observers
question the ability of the two companies to work together effectively.
The problems will be even greater for other transatlantic partnerships.
Other telephone companies in Europe are still under state-control and have
not even begun to make the transition to commercially-run companies that BT
started in the late 1980s.
There will be other problems along the way, many of them arising as global
consortia threaten to take lucrative business contracts from state-owned
telephone operators in smaller countries, leaving them only with the
unprofitable residential customers.
A momentum has built up behind the formation of global alliances which will
assure their emergence, but there will be problems along the way, and big
businesses - in whose interests the alliances are being formed  - will have
to wait a little longer before operators deliver the services that match
their global service claims.

Computer industry in transition - The seismic trauma that has rocked the
computer industry in the early 1990s is not just the result of a recession -
it is the result of a fundamental shift in technology / Philip Manchester
looks at network developments and the business benefits of client-server
systems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The computer industry fared well in previous recessions because companies
turned to automation to save costs and cut staff. But in the early 1990s it
was different. Former giants of the industry - such as IBM and DEC -
tottered alarmingly and have yet to prove they will survive the upheaval.
The main cause is the transition from centralized, mainframe-based computing
to distributed client-server-based computing.
In many ways the transition reflects a wider change which is taking place in
industry generally; local autonomy from the distribution of computer power
and management responsibility.
Technologically, this change manifests itself in client-server systems - an
approach to distributed computing which separates users (clients) and the
services they use (servers).
Client-server computing has its origins in database management systems
(DBMS) and the trend to separate the software used to access data from the
software used to manage it.
During the 1980s, developers created a new model for DBMS which allowed
these two components to be distributed across computers on a network. The
front-end tools - data query languages and local applications - became known
as 'clients' and the back-end DBMS 'engines' became known as servers.
Database vendors such as Oracle, Ingres, Sybase and Gupta use this approach
in their products with the result that they can all communicate with each
other.
A front-end tool from Gupta, for example, can use a back-end DBMS engine
from Oracle without the user ever being aware of the location of the data.
Client-server computing extends this idea across the whole system and breaks
down functions according to their role either as a client or a server.
addition to DBMS servers, a modern network will have servers to handle
printing, communications, mass storage back up and so on.
This approach can bring many benefits. It allows users greater freedom in
their choice of hardware and software - with consequent cost-savings. It
makes systems more flexible and provides for better integration of different
types of systems.
'We have to tie the benefits to the business and I think client-server does
this in four ways,' says Mr Lawrence Hunt, director of distributed
processing at the UK software company ACT.
'Firstly, client-server is much more flexible than traditional mainframe
systems. If you want to get data for management information systems, this is
difficult with closed mainframes.
'Secondly, it lets you integrate application more easily. You can integrate
a PC-based spreadsheet into a mainframe database much more easily with a
client-server approach.
'Thirdly, client-server systems give much more independence from vendors.
All business want to future-proof their investment in applications software,
which probably represents 80 per cent of the cost of a system. Client-server
enables you to do this effectively.
'Finally, client-server systems can cut costs. We were recently installed a
client-server system at a large investment bank. The costs came to about
Pounds 1.5m. It would have cost Pounds 3m if we'd had to use a traditional
approach with mainframes,' says Mr Hunt.
Other financial institutions have also opted for the client-server approach
in a big way. The Nationwide Building Society, for example, has standardised
on Microsoft's Windows NT operating system as the lynchpin for a
client-server system which will support 10,000 personal computer users over
the next three years. It is also looking into the possibility of plugging
its Automatic Teller Machine network into the new system with Windows NT as
the controlling software.
National Westminster Bank has also adopted Windows NT as the basis for its
client-server developments.
Most organisations are adopting a cautious approach to the transition from
traditional centralized computer to client-server systems, however.
Paymaster, formerly the Paymaster General's Office, is typical - 'we are
introducing client-server slowly - function by function. We have started
with electronic mail and access to shared spreadsheet and are moving on to
introducing more function on desktop PCS,' says Mr Derick Harbottle,
director of information technology at Paymaster.
After many years of relying on an ICL mainframe computer to do everything,
Paymaster has embarked on an ambitious plan to integrate up to 800 users
into a three-layer client-server system using hardware from Olivetti and
software from Novell and Oracle.
The ICL mainframe will eventually become no more than a database server.
'We have a heritage of 'legacy' systems on mainframes and we had to see if
it was practical to move away from the mainframe. After a rigorous
right-sizing study to see if it was feasible, we opted for a staged approach
with a pilot project to start,' says Mr Harbottle. Paymaster's move to
client-server is the result of the same commercial pressure faced by
business. Following changes in the UK government's approach to public
services and the introduction of market testing, Paymaster has had to become
aware of the service it offers it customers.
'We have made the change for sound business reasons. We are forward-looking
company and need do more than sit back and let things just happen,' says Mr
Harbottle.
He goes on to emphasise that client-server should not be seen as a
technology solution - but a business solution which brings greater
flexibility to building information systems. He is also wary of expecting
too much in the way of cost savings - 'some people are talking about the
technical issues or the cost-saving issues. We prefer to concentrate on the
business benefits which will come from client-server,' he explains.
Any move to a new technology is bound to cause new problems and the
transition to client-server systems is no exception. Paymaster's cautious
approach - with carefully phased introduction of the new system alongside
the old, is an object lesson in how to move to client-server with the
minimum amount of pain.
'We try to avoid being at the bleeding edge of technology. Rather than
inventing our own, we would rather steel other people's wheels,' observes Mr
Harbottle.

Users pin hopes on ATM - Network capacity / Demand for space on computer
networks keeps exceeding supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The present structures of local area networks of personal computers,
Ethernet and Token Ring, running at 10 megabits and 16 megabits per second
respectively, will soon be unable to cope with the growing volume of
traffic.
As users compete for communications channels, the actual speed of delivery
to each of them is often only a tenth of the network's theoretical capacity.
When more users come on to the network, its performance degrades.
Network managers have responded to the rising demand by exploiting existing
systems more efficiently. This is one of the main reasons for the enormous
growth in sales of devices such as intelligent hubs, bridges and routers in
the past couple of years. They have helped a lot, but it will not be enough.
Fibre Distributed Data Interface, running at 100MBps, has been regarded by
many as the probable solution, but it has so far proved too expensive. FDDI
and Fast Ethernet, also running at 100MBps, may be overtaken by ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode).
Experts now agree that ATM is the only technology that can give the
necessary transmission speed for communicating image, voice and data
together in real time at an acceptable price. It can use existing wiring,
which will help keep down the cost. It may therefore be what is needed to
start the long- expected spread of multimedia applications.
Ethernet and Token Ring have suffered from a lack of standards, which has
meant a large amount of conversion of data from one format to another. The
move to ATM, which is rapidly becoming standardised, may be equivalent to
removing official frontier controls.
Unlike its predecessors, ATM uses a technology known as cell relay, which
takes advantage of the high speed transmission capacity of fibre optic
cables. It handles data in fixed length cells rather than variable length
packets, which is thought to be more efficient. This should push the speed
of transmission up to a maximum of around 2.4 gigabits per second.
For backbone systems in office and factory buildings, 155MBps is expected to
be the usual speed; 45MBps may be typical for combined data, voice and
video. ATM will not put upper or lower limits on the transmission speed but
use that which is appropriate to the application.
Other important advantages of ATM are that it is a much simpler system than
the older ones and can be used for both local area and wide area networks,
which should further reduce migration costs and ease the task of network
management.
ATM was invented to serve the needs of the public telephone companies, but
was soon taken over by the pioneering computer companies of California's
Silicon Valley.
The ATM Forum, which was set up by the computer companies in 1991 and now
has over 200 members, comes out with a new standard every couple of months
and is rapidly completing the set which is needed.
It is setting a pace which the telephone companies cannot match. Mr Tim
Ward, strategic marketing director for Network Equipment Technologies (NET),
a leading company in the forum, admits that there has been a lot of 'hype'
for ATM but argues that it was necessary.
'It has turned people's attention to ATM as a local area network
technology,' he says.
'ATM-ready' LAN products began to come on to the market in 1992. ATM on LANs
is forecast to prove a more cost-effective solution than on WANs or on the
public carriers' services. So it is likely to be adopted for LANs long
before the telephone companies have worked out the details of their
offerings.
The largest corporations will probably be the first to take up the
technology. Banks want it in their dealing rooms, where video and news
agency reports may be joined on a single fibre optic feed.
Users are only experimenting with it at the moment; live applications will
follow in a year or two. Many of the telephone companies worldwide will
introduce their first ATM services this year.
According to Mr Sean Phelan, principal analyst for market research firm
Yankee Group Europe, pricing presents them with a dilemma. 'If they price it
too low they risk cannibalising their current revenues, but if they price it
too high the uptake will be very small,' he says.
'The arrival of ATM therefore represents a big opportunity for new entrants
into the telecommunications business.' For most users the big question is
when they should try to move to ATM.
A report last year by the Ovum consultancy said that potential users of ATM,
especially in Europe, were cynical about it, partly because current ATM
products did not match their expectations. Ovum said that ATM provided far
more than enough bandwidth but added that this did not translate into the
functionality required.
One of the authors of the report, Mr Iain Stevenson, says that their
cynicism may be dispelled by a number of new products from hub and router
vendors which will be delivered this year. He notes the telephone companies
are worried that ATM may leave them 'holding the string' for users who have
equipment on their premises which is intelligent enough for them to manage
their own networks.
'The telephone companies have to get closer to their customers to find out
what services they really want,' he says.
One of the technical concerns about ATM has been that receiving devices may
not be able to cope with the throughput. Data cells could get lost in the
pipeline and need to be re- sent.
'With only a small disruption an encyclopedia could have gone by,' notes Mr
Jim Boyle, vice-president of wide area networking for IBM. IBM has stated
that ATM is one of its key technology strategies and it is investing heavily
in research into network congestion. The design of ATM networks will be
difficult, at least until flow control software matures.
Users may therefore be wise to hire systems integrators to build these
networks for them.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (9): A
whole new shopping experience - Customers may one day don headsets for a
'virtual reality' armchair walk around their favourite stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine, 20 years from now, a couple want to hold a dinner party but cannot
decide what to cook.
They reach for a handset and call up some ideas from an electronic recipe
book on the high definition video screen in their living room. Unsure
whether one particular dish might be too difficult, they press a button for
a video recording of a chef showing how to prepare the meal step-by-step
Satisfied they can manage, they move on to the wine. Further clicks on the
remote control call up video recordings of winemakers wandering around their
vineyards, talking about their wines.
The choices made, the couple transmit an order via the handset to their
favourite food retailer. A few hours later, the ingredients and wine will be
delivered to a special hatch at their home. They may even be delivered at
the same time as the couple's regular, weekly shopping order.
Such a vision remains a fantasy. But retailers believe it could be a
reality, even a commonplace, by early in the next century. What will make it
possible is the conjunction of multi-media technology, allowing sound,
pictures, graphics and text to come together on one screen, with fibre-optic
technology, enabling huge amounts of information to be sent at high speed to
and from consumers' homes.
Technological advances in the past 20 years have revolutionised the way
retailers run their businesses, producing huge gains in operating
efficiency, but they have not fundamentally changed the shopping experience.
In the next 20 years, however, technology could revolutionise shopping
itself.
It will change the view of shops as simply repositories for goods to be sold
to the public. It is also likely to break down the barriers between
shopping, recreation, and even education.
The biggest growth area is expected to be TV shopping - already booming in
the US. The cable home shopping industry there - dominated by Home Shopping
Network and QVC (Quality, Value, Convenience) - where customers watch a
succession of products on screen and order by telephone, generated turnover
of Dollars 2.3bn last year. So-called 'infomercials', advertisements used to
sell products directly to the public, pulled in a further Dollars 700m.
On-line computer shopping services, in their infancy but expected to
mushroom, generated Dollars 200m.
Coopers  Lybrand, which has just completed a year-long, Dollars 1.2m survey
with sponsors NCR, Telxon and Citicorp into Retailing in the 21st century,
says that as the number of available cable channels increases, conventional
shopping channels are expected to proliferate, probably targeted at
increasingly narrow age and interest groups.
Established retailers are already seizing upon TV shopping as a potent
selling force. Macy's, the US department store group, is launching a
shopping channel later this year.
The next stage, as more sophisticated communication networks are developed,
could be the grouping together of information providers, network operators
and transaction companies. That would enable customers to select purchases
and transmit orders to retailers via a remote control, as described above.
An essential part of the growth of such channels is likely to be fast,
secure delivery of products to consumers' homes, posing new challenges for
retailers.
However, shops as physical entities will not die out. Many consumers will
always want the opportunity to examine or try on products before they
purchase. Convenience stores for top-up and impulse purchases are likely to
remain indispensable - although they may become more specialised.
But stores will have to ensure they provide a 'value-added' shopping
experience and come up with new attractions to lure shoppers away from their
TV screens.
Technological advances are expected soon to make shopping, especially
grocery shopping, less onerous. One way will be to end queues at check-outs
by developing shopping trolleys that scan purchases as customers make them
and automatically deduct the cost from their credit or charge card.
Symbol Technologies and Videocard have already developed a trolley with a
blanket of laser beams across the top which can read barcodes of goods being
put into the trolley, from any angle. The trolleys are being trialled in the
Netherlands.
The next step may be using silicon chips or tags which can be read by a
radio beam on the trolley. A prototype system has been developed by the
South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in conjunction
with the British Technology Group.
Eventually, however, customers may not need to put goods into trolleys
themselves. Supermarkets - and other stores - may display just one example
of each product. Customers will walk around the shop and wave a wand across
a bar code on the shelf to order and pay for a product. Their order will be
assembled behind the scenes by staff.
Surplus selling space might be used instead for cooking classes and
demonstrations, or multi-media kiosks offering information.
For those who do not insist on seeing or handling every item, the process
could be taken further. Why walk around a supermarket when you could be,
say, enjoying a meal in a restaurant, making selections from an electronic
shopping catalogue and picking up your order when you have finished your
coffee?
As well as making shopping more enjoyable, advances in information and
communications technology will give customers more choice and control.
Stores may no longer stock products, but instead offer customers the
opportunity, assisted by knowledgeable staff or consultants, to customise or
even design their own merchandise - for example to choose the colour, fabric
and precise size they want items of clothing to be made in, with the order
transmitted instantaneously to a factory and the finished product despatched
the same day.
In the US, the Blockbuster retail chain in a venture with IBM is allowing
customers to select tracks for and record their own compact discs on the
spot.
Japan is experimenting with mobile production units in trucks or vans for
goods such as spectacles and contact lenses, which take orders by telephone
and deliver products rapidly to a customer's home or workplace.
Themed and 'experiential' stores, such as those operated by Disney and
Warner Brothers, are also expected to increase, using technology such as
virtual reality to sell goods.
In the long run, customers may not stare at video screens at home, but
instead - a prospect that still sounds like science fiction - don headsets
that allow them to wander around virtual reality stores, or even virtual
shopping malls.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (7): The
paperless office pays off for structured tasks - The electronic office / The
paperless office is as far off as ever for what might be termed wide-ranging
jobs. But for highly structured tasks, such as handling insurance claims or
invoices, cutting down on paper can lead to substantial gains in
productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of new technologies make it possible for modern offices to cut back
on paperwork - they include image processing (which converts paper documents
into electronic images), workflow (which controls the flow of work between a
group of workers), electronic mail and electronic data interchange.
Image processing and workflow:
At General Accident's 1-2-1 division, which sells insurance directly to the
public, a Pounds 1.5 million ATT GIS image processing system has speeded up
claims processing and increased productivity by 20 to 30 per cent.
Bob Thomson, personal lines operations manager for General Accident, says:
'We're working in a very competitive environment and wanted to make
significant savings. A lot of resources were going into filing and looking
for paper, and we wanted all documents to be accessible from a single
source.'
Now the 1,000 to 1,500 items that arrive in the post every day are scanned
into the image processing system and assembled into electronic files, which
can be viewed on a computer. 1-2-1's 54 staff (who spend most of the time on
the phone) thus have everything they need to work on a claim on screen,
without having to get up and look for files.
Image processing and workflow software are also being used at the UK offices
of US oil company, Amerada Hess. They have enabled the company to process
higher volumes of invoices without increasing the number of accounts staff.
Amerada Hess' system, developed in conjunction with US image processing
company Filenet, scans every paper invoice into a computer system.
If the invoice is straightforward and the goods have been received and match
the original purchase order, the bill is paid. If it needs to be verified by
an engineer or a senior accountant, it is sent to their computer screens
electronically via Digital Equipment's Teamlinks package.
Once approved the invoice is automatically sent to the general ledger
department for a cheque to be issued. The system is faster and more
efficient than the old system in which all accounting information was typed
in to the computer from a paper invoice, and sometimes added to by an
engineer or accountant, and it now takes only minutes to locate one of the
50,000 invoices Amerada receives each year, rather than a day or longer.
Electronic mail
However, image processing and workflow are not the only route to reducing
paper. David Ferris, a British-born but US-based electronic mail (e-mail)
consultant says that use of e-mail can cut back on paper and give huge gains
in productivity.
He says that these gains will not necessarily come from interpersonal
messaging of the 'Are you free for lunch on Friday' variety, but rather from
the use of 'mail-enabled' applications, where an application such as word
processing or electronic forms has an e-mail option built in. Mr Ferris
says: 'Automating simple business forms, such as expenses, can cut a
company's costs by between one and two per cent of revenues.'
For example, time sheets created using JetForm software and sent via Lotus
Development's cc:Mail or Microsoft Mail, save California-based
diskette-maker and CD-ROM duplicator, Trace Dollars 270 a year per employee.
The system costs Dollars 44 a year per employee, giving a financial return
of more than 400 per cent a year.
E-mail can also provide other, less measurable benefits, such as improved
decision making, better communication across time zones, more up-to-date
market information, faster reactions to unexpected events, and shorter
product-development times from geographically dispersed teams. E-mail can be
used on all sorts of computer, but the fastest growing area of the market is
e-mail for local-area networks of PCs.
Another growth area is e-mail for executives who spend a lot of time out of
the office. One of the latest products designed for mobile e-mail users is
Lotus' cc:Mail Remote for Windows. This allows executives to exchange
messages with their in-house Lan e-mail system and keep in touch with what
is going on back at base. Larry Crume, vice president of messaging at Lotus,
predicts that it will be the company's biggest selling product this year and
could hit sales of a million copies.
Electronic data interchange:
At present, many large companies use e-mail primarily for internal
communications. By contrast, electronic data interchange (EDI) is used
mainly for inter-company communications, where cutting out paper can
significantly speed up the processing and transmission of information. (EDI
or paperless trading is the name given to the exchange of structured
business documents, such as orders and invoices, directly between
computers.)
For example, a sales management system underpinned by GE Information
Service's public EDI network, helped to cut the time it took for US orders
to arrive at Benetton's Italian clothing factories from three-to-ten days to
just hours.
Use of EDI is expanding. In Britain, 8,400 companies have adopted it and new
types of paperless EDI message are being developed all the time. For
example, a UK EDI standard for utility bills has been developed and is
waiting for European endorsement, and despatch and binding messages are
being developed for users in printing and publishing.
But large scale users of EDI have one big problem - how to communicate with
even very small suppliers or customers via EDI.
One solution is to use what is known as hybrid EDI where those who aren't
equipped to receive EDI documents electronically receive them on paper. A
number of options are available including BT's EDI-to-fax service for its
EDI*Net customers and the Royal Mail's Edipost (EDI-to-post). Here, EDI
messages are sent to the Royal Mail's electronic data centre and then
converted to paper for delivery by post. Recipients can phone back their
responses, which in turn will be converted into EDI messages.
Barriers to the paperless office
Hybrid EDI is a sensible compromise but it underlines just how difficult it
is to get rid of paper when paper is accessible to every business from the
corner shop to the multinational.
Another problem is that electronic images of paper documents are not legally
admissible in court, even though they can include signatures, and are
difficult to alter.
For example, Amerada Hess files copies of its paper invoices, in case its
auditors, consortia partners or the VAT office want to see them, and General
Accident is keeping paper records of documents scanned into its imaging
system on site for six months before deciding what to do with them. Jeff
Goldberg, an analyst at researchers Dataquest, says: 'The promised paperless
office has become the 'paperfull' office, partly because computers have not
yet achieved the readability, or portability, of paper.'
This is good news for printer companies - 'more and more data is being
stored on computers and people want to output it in a variety of ways,' says
Kevin Spinks, printer business manager at printer company, Lexmark. 'This
creates more and more paper and the demand for printers is growing at 15 to
20 per cent a year. I can't see the paperless office taking off this
century.'

NEC's Super Tower sets the pace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Tokyo headquarters of NEC, the electronics company, has one of the
world's most advanced commercial communications systems, writes Michael
Wiltshire.
Built on the site where NEC first began operations in 1899, the 43-storey
Super Tower, pictured above, features the NEC's Super Aladdin system for
total office automation. This includes electronic mail, electronic statement
and receipt systems for the collection and distribution of documents, an
electronic bulletin board, closed circuit and satellite television services
which links NEC's three north American subsidiaries - NEC America, NEC
Electronics and NEC Technologies.
Other features used by the 6,000 staff of the Super Tower include electronic
telephone notebooks which contain the 35,000 telephone numbers within the
company. There are also automatic message services on telephone terminals.
Office facilities of the Super Tower also include electronic secretarial
services for setting up schedules and monitoring business progress. Staff
work to a flexitime system - 'this seeks to encourage the self-esteem of
company employees by giving them more control and responsibility over their
working time,' says NEC.

Focus for all banking activity - Despite the high cost of applying the
latest information technology, the banks - faced with mounting competition -
can no longer survive without persistent investment in this area / Michael
Dempsey highlights IT applications in finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We don't have warehouses full of cash. We have information about cash -
that is our product.' Thus, Peter Lazard, head of technology strategy and
research at Abbey National sums up the relationship between banking and
information technology, (IT).
On the surface, computer technology has become the focus of all banking
activity. The real assets of any financial institution are now locked away
in digital form. The rise of the technology-driven bank has coincided with
fierce commercial pressures and a relentless struggle to keep overheads
down.
IT briefly served to offer a 'holy grail' during the 1980s. Banks signed up
for huge projects on the grounds that more information meant better
business. By and large, they ended the decade disillusioned. Computers had
proved their worth, handling vast quantities of data but they had not come
cheap, and on the way banks found themselves employing a growing army of
programmers and systems analysts.
With financial deregulation in the UK, retail banks have faced new
competitors. Abbey National is a building society turned bank. Lazard notes
that Abbey National has used computers for thirty years. Historically this
meant large expensive mainframe machines. Falling hardware prices and the
event of the micro-processor saw computing break out of the mainframe world.
IT was suddenly available across the board.
'Technology was a barrier, due to cost. Now it is a gateway, an enabler
rather than an inhibitor. That is very significant to us.' Lazard says.
Abbey National operates systems ranging in size and supplier. Large
mainframes from IBM and Unisys still provide the backbone for essential
services such as savings, current accounts and insurance packages, but the
advent of powerful workstations that do not require IT specialists to drive
them has revolutionised the branch network. Abbey National has recently
completed a four-year programme to install rings of workstations linked into
local networks in each of its 685 branches.
These Olivetti machines are tied to a dedicated communications workstation
at each site, which is networked on a national basis through lines leased
from British Telecom. The object of the exercise is data-sharing through the
communications host machine. In theory, any member of staff can work with
any application on any workstation. The entire branch programme, including
banking software, cost Pounds 95m. Over the last seven years Abbey National
has invested a total of nearly Pounds 200m in IT.
Large though it seems, banks can no longer survive without persistent
investment in IT, a condition Lazard defines as a growing dependency on
information as a product. In theory, IT should allow banks to make better
use of that information.
One of Abbey National's computers is an ATT Teradata database engine, an
extremely powerful box dedicated to analysing customer data. The price tag
on the entire Teradata installation is around Pounds 10m, but this expensive
specialist tool is the only option if Abbey National is to exploit customer
profiles and mount direct sales campaigns.
Expert systems are computer programmes designed to replicate and multiply
human knowledge. Barclays Bank is employing Lending Advisor to back up
decisions on commercial lending. Software licences from supplier
Syntelligence cost upwards of Pounds 600,000. If the expert system can
succeed in producing a coherent and secure lending policy it is money well
spent.
The world of the expert system is a clear example of IT coming to be used as
a precision tool. In the past, vast banking IT projects stumbled because
computers were employed in an indiscriminate fashion. Banks have learnt to
target IT to deal with specific problems. Thus, multimedia, the mixing of
sound and video images with data on one screen, is seen as having large
potential for banks.
Multimedia computer terminals represent the logical next step in the march
of the automatic teller machine. Condensing all the human functions of
retail branch banking on to a machine has obvious attractions for
institutions determined to slash payrolls.
Some banks are seizing on multimedia to squeeze extra revenue out of
existing floorspace. Turin-based San Paolo Bank is installing Olivetti
multimedia terminals in its branches. San Paolo rents out space on these
machines to third parties who use the interactive video display to sell
services. The Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) has 1350 branches. and is
experimenting with multimedia equipment from ATT's NCR arm in two branches,
in Newcastle and Watford.
Paul Swainbrook's job as director of Teleservice at the TSB is to set up a
telephone banking system. He has worked on the multimedia experiments and is
blunt about the impact of such technology - 'customer shock proved much more
powerful than you might think.' The TSB discovered that without human
intervention, in the form of a Customer Care Officer, its account holders
would not do business with a box.
This experiment justified a policy of applying IT in a restrained fashion.
'It's about not being supply-driven,' says Swainbrook. 'You start out by
asking what the customer wants, and then give him the choice whether or not
to use the technology. Why persist with a solution if the customer doesn't
want it?'
The TSB is embarking on remote telephone banking courtesy of IT. Cheaper and
more powerful computers have enabled banks to set up parallel institutions
such as Teleservice within a practical timeframe. Teleservice pools the
skills of computer and telephony integration specialist Datapoint, telecoms
provider Mercury and IT supplier Unisys.
The project will cost tens of millions of pounds, but by a judicious
marriage of telecoms and IT, TSB will acquire a new banking structure
without the overheads of a physical branch network. Teleservice will follow
in the steps of Midland Bank's First Direct operation. Technology is the
enabler, but public interest is the motivator. Banks are finally taking a
firm grip on the IT toolbox.

FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices respond to strong gains
in bonds - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong gains in British government bonds and further indications that
economic recovery is showing through in corporate results laid the
foundation for a 34-point advance in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday. Trading
volume gathered pace as the stock market moved ahead to a confident close.
Investors were encouraged by good news on US inflation, by confidence ahead
of the Bund-esbank's money market repos tender today and by another round of
dividend increases from UK companies. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at
3,267.4, with some analysts predicting that the 3,300 mark could be
challenged again before the end of the week.
A week heavy with important economic statistics saw the opening of
yesterday's session dominated by prospects for the US producer price index,
announced at midsession in London.
News that the core index had risen by only 0.1 per cent in February,
reducing the likelihood of a tightening in Federal Reserve credit policy,
was well taken in Europe.
UK equities, which had made modest progress during the morning, began to
move up strongly behind gains of more than a full point in long-dated
government securities.
On the domestic front, the switch in market sentiment in favour of signs of
economic recovery was encouraged first by news that UK construction industry
orders had jumped by 16 per cent in the three months to January, and then by
strong profits and dividend announcements from the construction and building
sectors.
An increase of around one-third in the dividend payment from Wolseley,
Britain's leading builders merchant, reinforced market confidence that
higher payouts will provide the drive for the stock market.
Little heed was paid to the latest distributive trades survey from the
Confederation of British Industry, which suggested a slowdown in the rate of
retail sales increase.
Store and consumer issues mostly followed the market trend, as investors
took the view that economic recovery will provide the basis for higher
levels of consumer spending. Heavy trading in Barclays reflected continuing
dividend optimism. The strength of sterling failed to deter shares in the
big exporting firms.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 16.8 at 3,902.5 as buying spread through the
list of building and construction shares, many of which are outside the
FT-SE 100 stocks. By the end of the session, Seaq volume, at 616.1m shares,
showed a 10 per cent increase from Monday's total. Retail, or customer,
business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.25bn. While a little below last week's
average, retail business in equities remained healthily profitable for
London-based securities firms.
While sounding fully confident last night, market strategists pointed out
that today will bring significant tests for shares and bonds in the form of
the latest data on domestic retail sales, unemployment, average earnings and
unit wage costs. All will be scanned for evidence of progress in the
domestic economy, as well as for inflationary pressures.
With Wall Street a shade lower at the London close, it was clear that
attention had switched to Germany and that the UK market will focus closely
today on the progress and outcome of the Bundesbank repos tender, where some
analysts hope to see rates trimmed more sharply than they were last week.

'Evolutionary rather than revolutionary' - Multimedia in the office / Bill
Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft, has poured scorn on most of the
multimedia trials in the US and Europe, reports Alan Cane. Microsoft is
meanwhile investing Dollars 100m a year in multimedia and aims to set the
agenda in the technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, is
harnessing its resources to a new goal: leadership in the design of
multimedia systems.
It is already investing over Dollars 100m a year - out of an research and
development budget of Dollars 473m - on the critical operating software. Mr
Bill Gates, the company's founder and chairman, said earlier this month that
the company had more people working on multimedia than any other software
group.
The implication is that the company wants to establish its software as the
global standard in multimedia just as its MS/DOS and Windows operating
systems are the world standard for IBM's design of personal computers.
There have been some early clues: Microsoft is already working with Sega,
the Japanese games console manufacturer, on an operating system for a new
machine, although Mr Gates says the project is small and divorced from
Microsoft's mainline operating systems development.
Some weeks ago, it bought Soft Image, a Canadian company which is market
leader in the esoteric discipline of software for moving picture animation.
The special effects in the film Jurassic Park are its work.
Furthermore, it has announced it intends to test its multimedia software in
collaboration with Tele-Communications Inc.,( TCI), the largest US cable
operator. A first fruit from the venture will be a new channel of
programming aimed at the consumer market for computer hardware, software and
accessories.
What Microsoft intends to provide is the operating software which will
manage the flow of information of all kinds on to high speed networks and
the software which will connect it to personal computer operating systems in
the home or office. It may also provide some of the applications - a
personal money management program, for example.
Mr Gates says 'there are a lot of companies developing software for the
'information highway,' just as there were a lot of companies involved in
operating systems at the beginning of the personal computer business.
Everybody who is doing multimedia software will have lots of pilots. Based
on the quality of those pilots, some will emerge stronger than others'.
Mr Gates said Microsoft would begin testing home multimedia services in the
US and Europe in 1995. He did not expect substantial returns on his
investment for five years, although he thought that there would be
substantive developments in multimedia in 1996-97 with entire cities
converted to interactive networks.
Multimedia and the 'information superhighway,' the high-capacity network
which will link vast repositories of information with modified television
sets or personal computers, are creating intense interest among computer
companies, telecommunications organisations and entertainment firms. They
are jockeying to take advantage of what are expected to be lucrative new
business opportunities.
Bill Gates, however, argues that most are taking the wrong approach - 'dead
ends' were how he described them - 'because the user-interface is so simple,
and because they do not tie in to personal computers in the right way, the
results will be disappointing. The revenue and the usage that comes out of
them will not justify the huge infrastructure costs.'
most of the trials to date have been designed to exploit domestic
multimedia, offering, typically, menus of video films for home viewing, Mr
Gates says that business will make use of the multimedia first.
'The first widespread use of these capabilities will be in business,' he
predicted. 'It will involve things like video-conferencing and collaboration
which would enable you to do your job without going into the office. Or it
could help companies find expertise to help them out without the expert
having to travel.
'The network itself could create electronic markets able to find a resource
of any type.'
'So, what in the past we have seen as electronic markets for currencies or
stocks will move into items of all types where chequeing references and
other kinds of working together can be done very effectively in electronic
form.'
'This will be done by extending the range of the personal computer. One of
the early symptoms will be very low cost video conferencing where a PC is
connected up to an ISDN (integrated services digital network). Within two or
three years this will be extremely widespread.
(Intel, which makes the microprocessors used in the majority of the world's
personal computers, earlier this year announced a low-cost set of components
capable of turning a personal computer into a video-conferencing terminal).
Mr Gates thought that multimedia in the office would be evolutionary rather
than revolutionary, driven by proven technologies like electronic mail -
'the benefits of electronic mail are unbelievable. We could not run
Microsoft without that capability.
'Today, some think of electronic mail and work group software and the
Internet (an open, publicly available computer network spanning several
continents) as separate things, but with some enhancements to Windows due in
less than a year, we will bring all these things together.'
Once the technology and benefits have been established in a business
environment, that would be the time to move into the home.
Mr Gates was critical of the narrow range of many of the current multimedia
trials: 'Some of the early pilots will be particularly embarrassing because
they will not have the breadth of applications,' he said.
'The network operators running these pilots are acting against their own
interests because they are going to prove exactly what they do not want to
prove - that there will not be enough revenue generated to justify building
the infrastructure.'
'Until you have a broad range of applications, you will never be able to
demonstrate the true potential of these systems. That is why instead of
doing crummy pilots in 1994, we will start our trials in 1995.'
He extended his criticism to Oracle, the US database specialist with which
British Telecommunications has formed an alliance to test interactive
entertainment services in the home. Oracle will provide the software and
systems integration: 'I'm sure Oracle will change its approach because it is
a terrible approach,' he said.
Bill Gates' comments have to be seen against a background of intense
competition in the nascent multimedia business. Furthermore, he has never
been slow to promote Microsoft's efforts and pick holes in the competition.

Computers which appeal to the senses - The multimedia market is still in its
infancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multimedia brings sound and video to the personal computer. Like sex, it
promises to appeal to the senses. Unlike sex, multimedia has yet to appeal
to a wide audience.
However, one application which seems likely to increase the take-up rate of
multimedia is desktop video-conferencing. The technology is also suitable
for point-of-sale promotions, interactive educational/training software and
 -in very skilled hands - designing multimedia presentations.
Here and on the following page we look at two areas with most potential:
desktop video-conferencing and multimedia at the point of sale.
Desktop video-conferencing: Some computers now come fully equipped for
videoconferencing, allowing users to transmit live video images of
themselves to other, similarly-equipped users, and to see on their PC the
person they are talking to.
For example, Sun Microsystems, the US workstation company, says its new
SPARCclassic Unix workstation, which costs Pounds 4,340 (Dollars 6,510), is
the industry's lowest cost, fully-configured multimedia workstation. This
includes camera, real-time video-capture and compression and a storage disk.
But most users will have to buy a multimedia kit if they want to carry out a
video-conference in a window on their personal computer.
In April BT and Olivetti will begin selling multimedia kits which allow pc
users to do this. The BT-Olivetti kits will cost Pounds 3,595; they include
a small video camera which sits on top of the PC, a card which slots into
the PC, and software.
In addition, the kit makes it possible for users to transmit still video
images, photographs or sound. BT says the kit will send video at 15-frames a
second when it goes on sale.
At this speed, video images will be rather jerky (it may look as if the
person you are talking to has just come back from a boozy lunch). So
'meeting' someone for the first time via a desktop video-conference is not
ideal if you want to make a good impression. It is more suitable for
follow-up 'meetings,' where being able to see the person you are talking to
may give a better idea of their reactions.
Will this form of communication catch on?
Yes - according to Judith Jeffcoate, of the research consultancy Ovum. She
believes that between 1996 and the end of 1998, revenues from pcs equipped
for video will exceed those from conventional videoconferencing equipment.
Suppliers are also upbeat about the potential market. An increasing number
have developed desktop video-conferencing products. They include
Canada-based Northern Telecom (with the Visit system distributed by UK
computer dealers PP); Intel, the US semiconductor company; ATT; BT and IBM
(with Coco); Apple (in the US); and Olivetti.
Many of these products allow people engaged in a video-conference to point
to or edit information they can both see on their screens. Intel says that
with its system, users at far-flung sites can edit a report together, both
looking at the same version on their screens.
The system is modular and it is possible for US users to buy the ProShare
shared editing software for Dollars 99 without the full videoconferencing
kit (which costs Dollars 1,200 to Dollars 2,500). Intel is spending Dollars
100m (Pounds 67m) a year on what it calls personal conferencing technology.
Its multimedia kits will go on sale in Europe this year.
To use one of its kits, the user must have a pc based on a powerful
microprocessor (486DX or Pentium) and must install an ISDN (Integrated
Services Digital Network) telephone line. Most other desktop
videoconferencing systems are also designed to work with ISDN, a high-speed
digital dial-up service.
Simon Goodwin, of ATT Global Information Solutions, expects the multimedia
market to be worth Dollars 900m by the end of 1995. He believes that growth
will be fuelled by three factors: falling prices for multimedia components;
the acceptance and roll-out of Euro-ISDN, replacing proprietary national
ISDN communication; and the combined efforts of important European
industrial participators in exploring new opportunities and requirements for
videoconferencing products.
Point-of-sale promotions: Another potential growth area for multimedia is in
point-of-sale (POS) devices. These can be used not only to promote products
but also to collect information about customer preferences.
Many POS devices developed so far are linked into ISDN, so that they can
relay customer orders back to head office or be updated with the latest
product and price information.
Examples include:
An interactive point-of-sales terminal which Ford plans to use in its car
showrooms to enable customers to see the car of their choice in the colour
and configuration they want - for example, four doors, spoilers.
A system which helps a customer to choose a hairstyle from a database of
4,000 styles. Hairstyles can be superimposed on to a video image of the
customer's face to see how he/she would look. (Although the system is used
by only 18 Belgian hairdressers, Comsys of Belgium, its developers, is
undeterred, and has crossed the channel in search of UK business.)
A point-of sale terminal for a big music retailer. This system, developed by
Applied Interactive Marketing (AIM) of Piccadilly Circus, London, allows
customers to sample albums which are to be released in the next few months
(by selecting a track and a seeing a video clip of the singer). Customers
can operate the terminal using touch-screen commands, and indicate which
releases they are interested in buying.
AIM says that developing a multimedia POS system can take as little as three
to four months or up to a year and a half. Costs of developing a system
range from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 200,000.
Multimedia at the point of sale has a lot to offer. However, 24 multimedia
POS kiosks based in London's Heathrow airport illustrate the main problem
with the technology: most people are unfamiliar with multimedia
terminals/kiosks and are hesitant to try them out.
The colourful Galleria 21 Heathrow kiosks, designed by the John Herbert
Partnership (which was involved in the interior design of Terminal 4), use
ATT's multimedia technology. At first, people spotted the kiosks and
wondered what they were for. Most people did not know - so they did not use
them. Now the kiosks have been clearly labelled 'Tax free shopping' and ATT
says usage has increased. They allow travellers to use a touch-sensitive
screen to order goods via credit card.
The terminal works out how much the goods will cost, based on factors such
as which currency is being used in payment, delivery charge, and whether any
duty is payable. The goods thus ordered can be delivered to any destination
in the world within seven working days.
The tale of the 24 kiosks shows that a multimedia screen has only limited
powers of attraction. In order to reach a wider audience, multimedia
products must demonstrate clear benefits.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (2): A
whirlwind of innovation - Business assumptions will be repeatedly challenged
in the next few years as technological advances sweep the world of
communications. Multimedia, mobile computing and groupware are among the hot
topics, as Alan Cane explains here
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The key technologies emerging as the catalyst of the next wave of business
and social change have computing power and communications in common.
Multimedia, mobile computing and groupware are the most promising business
opportunities over the next three years. According to a group of computer
companies canvassed last month by Input, a US-based marketing consultancy,
client-server computing, networking in its various forms and document image
processing were all seen as providing continuing business, but there was
less enthusiasm for last year's fashionable topics including artificial
intelligence and graphic information systems.
The computer company's choices are supported by a diversity of evidence.
Deals like Viacom's Dollars 10bn acquisition last month of Paramount
Communications, the US information and entertainment group, exemplify the
excitement multimedia is generating. In January 1993, 150 US newspapers
published a total of 25 articles about multimedia; in December, the same
newspapers published 425 pieces on the topic.
The market for notebook and subnotebook (hand-held) computers is expected to
grow at 20 per cent or more this year compared with only six per cent or so
for the industry as a whole. Prices of subnotebooks seem set to follow their
desktop equivalents downwards especially with the launch of the Compaq
Contura Aero at under Pounds 1000 and the relaunch later this year of IBM's
Thinkpad 500. There is continuing interest in personal digital assistants
(PDAs) combining computing power with communications despite a muted market
response to the launch of Apple's Newton PDA.
The market for groupware - software designed to run on personal computer
networks to support the co-ordination of office activities and exemplified
by Lotus 'Notes' - looks likely to double in the US and Europe over the next
five years. According to Ovum, a London-based information technology
consultancy, the installed base of PC networks has now reached the critical
mass necessary to provide the incentive for the adoption of groupware.
Elimination of barriers
What has changed over the past few months is the speed at which these
esoteric technologies are becoming realities. Last month, for example, 400
senior telecommunications executives from companies including ATT, BT, MCI
and Mercury, packed a seminar in the US to hear claims that business and
society would be transformed by multimedia through the elimination of
barriers of time, space and form.
Opening the conference, Mr Rudy Puryear, managing partner, strategic change,
at Andersen Consulting, warned that every business assumption would be
repeatedly challenged in the next few years: 'The mean time between
surprises is shortening,' he said.
Most of the corporations present were already investigating the potential of
multimedia; most had only developed a serious interest in the topic in the
past year.
To a large extent, their enthusiasm is being driven by commercial demands,
rather than customer-need. Telecommunications companies like ATT, MCI, BT
and Mercury need to generate better margins from their networks by moving
from 'pots' to 'pans' ('plain old telephone services' to 'pretty awesome new
stuff'). Computer companies need to find new ways to encourage customers to
buy more computer power as prices fall to commodity levels. Among those
which have already declared an interest in multimedia are Apple Computer,
Intel, Silicon Graphics and Microsoft as well as the games market leaders
Sega and Nintendo.
Mobile computers and groupware are firmly established in the market place.
There are, however, question marks remaining over the potential of
multimedia. It has not been helped by confusion over what the term implies.
The essential definition is the transformation of information of all kinds -
textual, graphical, still and moving video pictures - into computer language
('bits') in which form it can be transmitted down a single communications
channel - which could be a telephone line or a compact disk - to a modified
television set or personal computer in the office or home.
The service is interactive; customers can send back instructions and
requests through the network. What is important is that different bits of
information are co-mingled in the transmission stream; the system is
responsible for sorting out which are text, which are video and so on.
Dr Nicholas Negroponti, director of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology media laboratory, believes that the impact of multimedia on the
business and social world is inevitable. He points to four trends:
First, the 'disappearing desk top' as executives become peripatetic, using
mobile computers on the move or while working from home.
Second, continuing miniaturisation which will make complex and bulky
technologies such as speech recognition for pcs simple and easily
transported.
Third, increased use of the so-called 'Negroponti switch' - the use of fibre
to bring multimedia to the office and home leaving precious broadcast
bandwidth for mobile telephony and computing.
Fourth, the use of intelligent software 'agents' to roam through electronic
libraries gathering information of interest to their owners.
ATT already has systems which make use of this advanced concept.
Four elements are required for the profitable development of multimedia
systems:
Powerful computers are needed to store, process and keep track of the bits.
High capacity telecommunications channels are needed to transmit them to
office or home.
There has to be a ready supply of information to feed the system.
The customer must be willing to pay for the new services.
All the technological elements for full scale multimedia are pretty well in
place; the computer power, software and networks capable of transporting
millions of bits a second at reasonable cost. Fibre optic technology is now
staggeringly powerful, capable of carrying 150,000 times the volume of
conventional telephone wires. Fibres can be spun from glass so pure that it
is possible to see through a block 70 miles wide.
Chip technology is making possible the computing power to sort through all
those bits. Dr Wei Yen, a senior vice-president at Silicon Graphics, a US
company which specialises in the manipulation of electronic images, said
that the necessary computing power would be available through the
development of microprocessor chips called 'media engines' with the power of
a supercomputer but cost only Dollars 200 (Pounds 136). His media engine
would be available next year.
Given the ability to make one billion calculations a second, he said,
presenting life-like images on the screen did not present technical
difficulties - 'reality is all mathematics,' he smiled.
The chips, which will process bits 64 at a time like a supercomputer, will
be incorporated first in Nintendo's Reality Immersion Technology, claimed to
allow players to step inside real-time, three dimensional worlds.
Nintendo's involvement gives the clue to the principal remaining problem:
the search for attractive and marketable services to feed the multimedia
machine. Entertainment is an obvious option.
New electronic services
Time Warner Cable, the second largest cable operator in the US, intends to
launch this autumn one of the largest tests yet of multimedia services. It
will, in the first instance, allow customers to watch videos delivered via
their telephone lines. The intention, however, is eventually to offer a
'full service network.'
About 4,000 homes around Orlando in Florida are being wired up for the
trial, which could pave the way for a fuller range of electronic services,
such as home banking and shopping.
The Orlando trial uses a combination of fibre optics and coaxial cable for
transmission; in the UK, BT intends to offer a video-on-demand service
offering acceptable picture quality over ordinary telephone lines.
The intention had been to open the service next month; Time Warner announced
it would be delayed earlier this month to allow - 'additional refinements of
the underlying system software and the set-top terminal.'
Coupled with the collapse at about the same time of the proposed merger
between Bell Atlantic and the cable operator Tele-Communications Inc.,
observers were noting that the path to the establishment of successful
multimedia systems will not be that easy.
Many observers, indeed, believe that multimedia will initially be driven by
business applications. An option is telecommuting. France Telecom is
experimenting with a range of technologies including electronic mail and
groupware which could be combined so employees can work from home or
electronic telecommuting centres.

Shoot-out between PowerPC and Intel's Pentium - Personal computers, the

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer's introduction of the first PowerPC Macintosh personal
computers blows the starting whistle on what promises to be one of the
toughest technology competitions in the history of the personal computer
industry.
On the PowerPC team, together with Apple, will be Motorola and International
Business Machines. Together, the three companies have co-developed a
microprocessor architecture which they aim to establish as a new industry
standard for PCs. They face the reigning champions of the PC microprocessor
market, Intel and its league of PC-manufacturing technology partners, led by
IBM.
One of the most curious aspects of this contest is that IBM is playing on
both sides. Long a close ally of Intel, IBM is the largest manufacturer of
Intel microprocessor-based PCs and says it intends to remain so. However,
the computer company is also a co-developer and manufacturer of PowerPC and
has stated that the new technology is central to its future strategy.
This ambiguity aside, the contest is a straight-forward shoot out between
PowerPC and Intel's Pentium, the latest version of its long-established
'x86' microprocessor lineage.
PowerPC has a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.
Theoretically, this suggests that it may be faster than Intel's Pentium.
However, PowerPC lacks the critical software base of Intel's microprocessors
and its performance in commercial systems is relatively unproven.
In contrast, Intel's Pentium has a huge head start in the marketplace as the
successor of the widely used Intel 386 and 486 microprocessors, the 'brains'
of most PCs in use today.
The Intel chips run Microsoft's popular MS-DOS and Windows operating system
software and the thousands of application programs designed to work with
them.
Apple's debut of PowerPC-based Macintosh computers will be a critical test
of the new technology. Apple is expected to launch three 'PowerMac'
computers ranging in price from about Dollars 2,400 to about Dollars 4,000
to replace its current 'Quadra' models aimed at business users. Apple says
that it intends to convert 40 per cent of its Macintosh shipments to PowerPC
by year's end, with the complete changeover occurring within three to four
years.
For Apple, the PowerPC represents an important transition from Motorola's
68000 line of microprocessors, which it has used since the introduction of
the Macintosh computer 12 years ago. Apple needed a new microprocessor to
keep pace with competitors using Intel's chips, but its decision to join
with IBM and Motorola in developing a brand new architecture makes the
transition more risky.
PowerPC's may have a speed advantage over Pentium. However, among existing
Apple customers the PowerMac may be judged as much for its compatibility
with existing Macintosh software as for its raw performance.
This could give the PowerPC a rough start in the personal computer market.
According to industry reports, about 90 per cent of existing Macintosh
software will run on the new Apple computers, but only via emulation
software which will significantly slow down performance.
Thus, although PowerPC may be theoretically capable of outpacing the Intel
Pentium, that may not be the practical experience of the first users of
personal computers based on the new microprocessor.
Apple says that about 75 application programs designed specifically for the
PowerMac will be available when the computers are introduced, and that
hundreds more are in development.
However, software companies are unlikely to make development of applications
programs for the PowerMac a high priority. Apple says that it expects to
sell up to one million PowerMac computers in the first 12 months. While this
would be a significant achievement for Apple, it presents a relatively
limited market for software designed solely for the PowerMac.
In contrast, Intel expects about 15 per cent of all PCs sold this year, or
approximately seven million units, to be based on its Pentium chips. Most of
the remaining 40m PCs will contain Intel 486 microprocessors. Thus,
Intel-based PCs represent a far larger potential market for software
applications than the PowerMac.
Therefore even if the PowerMac exceeds Apple's expectations, it will hardly
make a dent in Intel's dominance of the personal computer microprocessor
market.
Intel and its backers, meanwhile, are targeting Apple's existing market
share, aiming to take advantage of the uncertainties created by the
transition to PowerPC.
Apple, however, is not alone in its plans to offer PowerPC based personal
computers. IBM already offers a computer workstation based on the PowerPC
microprocessor. The company is expected to introduce a broad range of
'Power' machines for more general use, including portable PCs . But it is
not yet clear how IBM will position these products relative to its strong
Intel-based PC product line.
IBM is also actively seeking PowerPC endorsements from other computer
makers. The first, Canon of Japan, said recently that it will use PowerPC in
a new range of office computers and work with IBM and Motorola to develop
versions of PowerPC for use in hand-held and notebook-sized computers.
In Taiwan, PowerPC has attracted great interest among PC circuit-board
manufacturers. However, these sub-system manufacturers are unlikely to take
a leadership role in developing the PowerPC market. Instead, they tend to
wait for demand to develop in the US market.
'reference specifications' to PC manufacturers and software developers
interested in developing products around the new technology. Computers that
adhere to these specifications will eventually be able to run a smorgasbord
of operating systems and applications software, IBM says.
Microsoft has announced plans to port Windows NT to the PowerPC, and IBM's
new Workplace OS will run DOS, Windows, and OS/2 applications on the
PowerPC. PowerOpen, another 'multipersonality' operating environment, is
being developed specifically for PowerPC systems by Apple and IBM.
Together, IBM and Apple aim to establish a 30 percent share of the PC market
for PowerPC by the end of the decade, leaving Intel with perhaps 60 per cent
(the rest being clones of Intel microprocessors), down from about 80 percent
today.
Thus while PowerPC may somewhat diminish Intel's market share, not even its
most optimistic backers expect to overtake Intel's leadership in the
microprocessor market in the short term.
In the longer term, the outcome of the PowerPC versus Intel battle is likely
to depend as much on software developers as on the relative merits of each
type of microprocessor.

Floating down a Venetian canal or walking under the arched ceilings of a
medieval cathedral could all happen in the not-too-distant future without
the traveller leaving the armchair - see picture, right.
By holding a spaceball - that replaces the remote control pad - the armchair
traveller can explore the world through a virtual reality interface and
enhanced three-dimensional-type pictures on the home TV. This futuristic
tourism is just one of the TV-based home services being developed by BT
Laboratories at Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich in Suffolk.
Known as VRHS (for virtual reality home services), engineers are working on
a range of intuitive interfaces that could transform the way that TV is
viewed.

Mirror Group Newspapers experienced exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m
shares as the market responded enthusiastically to the latest figures and
pushed the stock up 7 to 197p.
A lift in advertising revenues and trading margins, together with far better
than anticipated profits, saw forecasts raised to between Pounds 82m and
Pounds 85m for 1994. The only concern was the slide in circulation following
the price war started by News International.
The two English power generators, PowerGen and National Power, were among
the best performers in a generally strong utilities area following a strong
buy recommendation published by NatWest Securities.
The broker's strategic assessment of the two companies focused on the long
term attractions of both groups. Upgrading the stocks to a buy, NatWest
highlighted strong dividend growth, lack of regulatory threats and
recovering market share. PowerGen moved forward 13 to 552p and National
Power 12 1/2 to 463p.
North West Water, up 20 to 546p, Severn Trent, 15 better at 579p, and Wessex
Water, 15 higher at 671p, were the pick of the water stocks.
The placing of a block of 5.9m Vodafone shares at a discounted 564p by house
broker UBS, to finance the acquisition of a one-third stake in General
Mobile Communications from Generale des Eaux, of France, saw Vodafone dip 4
to 571p.
Saatchi  Saatchi slipped a penny to 141p in spite of returning to
profitability. The market was disappointed by the group's margin growth. SG
Warburg reduced its 1994 profits forecast by 10 per cent to Pounds 30m.
An initial advance in electrical group Delta after the group revealed a
higher than expected dividend increase proved shortlived after brokers
downgraded current-year profits estimates.
Analysts were particularly concerned by the continuing pressure on profits
in the cable industry. The shares gave up 7 at 522p.
The list of brokers downgrading included Strauss Turnbull, which trimmed its
estimate by Pounds 4m to Pounds 59m. Several brokers advised investors to
switch out of Delta and into BICC, which appreciated 9 to 440p.
UK airports operator BAA closed 13 ahead at 1001p after a positive note on
the stock from NatWest Securities. The securities house, which expects 1994
profits of Pounds 324m, said: 'The company continues to produce traffic
growth marginally ahead of our expectations, giving us confidence in our
full-year profits forecasts.'
Analysts returned positive from pre-close season meetings with Granada,
helping the shares climb 6 to 561p amid profits forecast upgrades.
Euro Disney shares opened sharply down following the weakness seen after the
theme park group announced a financial rescue package on Monday. They later
rallied, ending the day 5 ahead at 395p.
Reports of a further round of price cuts in the milk market hurt Unigate and
Northern Foods, the shares slipping 3 to 348p and 2 to 218p respectively.
Tesco, off a penny at 223p, was said to be applying the renewed pressure on
suppliers, with expectations that other big operators Argyll, 3 ahead at
254p, and J. Sainsbury, 10 forward at 386p, are likely to follow suit. The
news follows weekend reports that Asda, up a penny at 60 1/2 p, was
pressuring suppliers to turn price promotions into permanent price
reductions.

FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Builders led by Wolseley

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that UK construction orders rose 16 per cent in the quarter ending on
January 31, plus stunningly good interim results from Wolseley, the UK's
leading builders merchant, saw the shares spearhead a general upsurge in the
building materials and merchants sector.
Wolseley's profits at Pounds 87m were around Pounds 17m higher than the most
optimistic forecasts in the market, while the 33 per cent rise in the
dividend compared with most expectations of an increase in the region of 10
per cent. BZW hoisted its current-year forecast for Wolseley from Pounds
153m to Pounds 187m and its 1995 estimate to Pounds 230m.
Mr Howard Seymour, building analyst at BZW, said Wolseley's 'phenomenally
good figures' confirmed the strong recovery coming through in the light end
of the building market.
Wolseley finished 73 higher at a record 975p. Since their elevation to FT-SE
100 status last June, Wolseley shares have climbed 46 per cent, compared
with a 12.3 per cent advance by the 100 index.
Wolseley's excellent results were followed by news of a near four-fold
profits increase from Heywood Williams, the building products group.
Marley is also expected to report bumper profits with its figures this
morning. A big line of Marley stock was taken out of the market last week,
prompting speculation that the figures would be much better than the market
expects. Most predictions for Marley point to pre-tax profits of Pounds
34m-plus.
Builders merchant Travis Perkins is expected to reveal more than doubled
pre-tax profits of some Pounds 20m tomorrow.
Marley rose 4 to 204p, Heywood Williams 7 to 437p, Graham Group, floated at
183p only a week ago, 8 to 214p, Meyer International 29 to 545p and Travis
Perkins 13 to 359p.
At the heavy end of the building materials sector, hopes of an early
reduction in German interest rates boosted Redland, up 9 at 571p, and RMC,
13 ahead at 972p.
Housebuilders, on the other hand, were unsettled by what was said to have
been a flat and uninspiring post-results meeting between George Wimpey and
construction sector analysts.
'We were expecting a bullish statement on housebuilding but got a rather
dismal appraisal,' said one analyst. Current-year profits estimates of up to
Pounds 50m were said to have been trimmed back to Pounds 45m and less in
some cases. Wimpey shares dropped to a low for the session of 206p following
the analysts meeting, before steadying to close a net 8 off at 210p.

<TEXT>
Continuing hopes of a reduction in interest rates, and a firm performance in
bonds, helped stock index futures to a premium as the March contract pulled
the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the Liffe March contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,227 was 6
points below the previous night's close, which initially led dealers to
expect a quiet session. But those early doubts soon faded, leaving March to
advance for most of the session, with 'solid US buying' said to have been
prominent in the first part of the day.
Having touched the day's high of 3,278, the contract finished at 3,272, up
39 from its previous close and at a 6-point premium to cash. Volume at the
official close was a healthy 16,480 contracts.
The Liffe Mid 250 March contract ended at 3,907 after business of 285 lots,
and June, which becomes the market leader next week, saw volume of 225
contracts. On the OMLX, the screens showed there had been no trade in the
FT-SE Mid 250 contract.
Turnover in Liffe traded options improved to 40,369 lots, with 21,792
contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,043 in the Euro FT-SE option.
Ladbroke was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,309 trades.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic news fails to
prevent Dow fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chip issues retreated yesterday in spite of a bond market rally and
more favourable news on the economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator finished 13.39 off at
3,849.59, although the Standard  Poor's 500 dipped just 0.38 to 467.01. In
the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched 0.07 ahead to 468.13
and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.72 to 793.52.
New York SE volume totalled 329.3m shares, while advancing issues narrowly
led declines by 1,112 to 1,001.
After ignoring further weakness in the US Treasury market the previous
session, stocks were unmoved by yesterday's rebound by bonds. Equities, at
best, could only manage to struggle into positive territory during the
morning, aided by some solid numbers on industrial production, coupled with
a tame report on producer price inflation.
The Labor Department reported a 0.5 per cent increase in the February
producer price index, but the stronger than expected reading was largely
attributed to a jump in energy prices, due to harsh winter weather last
month. Excluding energy and food, producer prices were up only 0.1 per cent,
against a consensus forecast of 0.3 per cent.
The encouraging figure triggered heavy buying of the benchmark 30-year
government bond, which is especially sensitive to inflationary expectations.
Yields fell well below the worrisome 7.0 per cent level, giving some
breathing room to equity investors troubled by a swift rise in long-term
interest rates in recent weeks.
Still, enthusiasm was restrained, with most indices showing little movement
during the first half of the session. During the afternoon the blue chips
suffered a downturn which left market observers at a loss to explain.
Among the Dow industrials, Boeing fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 7/8 ,
United Technologies Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 68 and General Motors Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 61 3/8 . The other car makers also gave ground, with Ford
down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63 1/8 and Chrysler off Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 59 1/4 . On a brighter note, ATT gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52
3/8 and McDonald's rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/2 .
The star of the session was Kemper, which surged Dollars 20 7/8 , or nearly
50 per cent from its previous close, to Dollars 61 3/4 . The stock took off
in overnight trading on news that GE Capital had launched a Dollars 2.2bn
takeover bid for the financial services concern. The announcement came just
as Monday's session was drawing to an end.
The buying spilled over into other financial services companies. Equitable
was Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 24 3/8 , Sun America climbed Dollars 2
to Dollars 40 1/2 and Conseco added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 58 5/8 .
In entertainment stocks, Capital Cities ABC forged ahead Dollars 11 3/4 to
Dollars 708 3/4 after announcing a proposed 10-for-one stock split. Time
Warner continued its impressive run, climbing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39
7/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 30 5/8 after
its new product line received good reviews from analysts, while Oracle shed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/8 .
Canada
Strong bonds and burgeoning economic confidence sent Toronto stocks to a
sharply higher close, defying the easier performance by Wall Street.
The TSE 300 composite index moved ahead 30.2 to 4,500.6 and rises led
declines by 465 to 339 after volume of 85.8m shares.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices ended firmer, with energy up 1.0 per cent and
industrial products ahead 0.9 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Domestic component in bourse
revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses found both domestic and international grounds for yesterday's gains,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, up nearly 2 per cent, was little affected by the US PPI figures,
finding other and various reasons for the rise, including lingering hopes of
a Buba rate cut tomorrow, as well as support from the futures market.
The CAC-40 index closed 43.50 higher at 2,258.52.
There was strong activity among media stocks. Canal Plus, in particular, was
one of the session's most active performers, adding FFr54 or 6 per cent to
FFr1,050. It was suggested that the group was helped by reports that the
government was reviewing its request for a financial commitment towards the
development of a cable network.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the construction group, up FFr8 at FFr592,
announced that its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose units would form a joint venture.
GTM dipped FFr28 or 5 per cent to FFr480. on the news.
Euro Disney, suspended limit down at one stage during the morning, recovered
to close the day up 85 centimes at FFr34.70.
FRANKFURT consolidated most of Monday afternoon's gains, the Dax index
showing a session rise of 20.42, and moved on again after hours with the
Ibis-indicated Dax closing at 2,178.91.
Brokers said that Monday afternoon's gains reflected Morgan Stanley's
raising of its recommended weighting in German equities. Turnover rose
again, from DM8.5bn to DM9.5bn.
Sentiment was lifted by Bayer which, unexpectedly, said that it would hold
the dividend at DM11. After a DM2.50 rise on the session the chemical group
rose another DM4.50 to DM380 after hours.
Relative strength continued in financials, in Siemens as it caught up with
other blue chips and in Volkswagen. But the most striking Dax stock gain was
in Schering: after an average response to Monday's progress report, the
pharmaceutical group put on DM37, or 3.6 per cent to DM1,073.
Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs said that there were six reasons for being
bullish about Schering: significant margin expansion in core
pharmaceuticals; Betaseron, the new multiple sclerosis drug; cost savings
potential; improvements in production techniques; strong cash flow; and
benefits from AgrEvo, the joint venture with Hoechst in agrochemicals.
AMSTERDAM firmed with strong interest seen in the heavily weighted issues,
DSM and Akzo Nobel, for example, adding a respective Fl 2.50 and Fl 2.80 to
Fl 124.40 and Fl 228.20.
The AEX index strengthened 3.37 to 427.27.
Hoogovens, which is expected to release 1993 results tomorrow that are
broadly expected to reveal another substantial loss, gained Fl 1.50 to Fl
68.70. Analysts expect the steel group to begin its return to profitable
operation in 1994, with the likelihood also that dividend payments will be
resumed.
Wolters Kluwer, the publisher, which satisfied investors with its 23 per
cent gain in 1993 profits, added Fl 1.50 to Fl 119.50.
ZURICH finished higher on the back of firmer US bonds, which rose after the
release of the US PPI figures. The SMI index rose 36.4 or 1.3 per cent to
2,906.9 but trading volume remained low.
Roche certificiates, the most active issue, put on SFr140 to SFr7,190.
SMH bearers slipped SFr20 to SFr880 amid doubts about further growth in the
watchmaker's market penetration, and the view that the Swatchmobile small
car project still had a long way to go.
Surveillance rose SFr70 to SFr2,110 after the inspection and verification
services group said that it expected its 1994 results to be in line with the
1993 outcome.
MILAN maintained its positive tone in spite of some selling ahead of today's
end of the monthly account. The Comit index added 4.28 to 678.06.
Demand from domestic funds and foreign investors helped some industrials and
blue chips higher. Fiat rose L33 to L4,998, Olivetti L55 to L2,510 and
Montedison L21 to L1,211.
Banco di Napoli fell L27 to L2,141 as Moody's, the US credit ratings agency,
said it had placed the bank's long-term credit ratings under review for
possible downgrade. The recently privatised banks remained firm: IMI rose
L27 to L12,640 and Credito Italiano put on L15 to L2,659. BCI added L125 to
L6,337, ahead of the first quotation tomorrow of its privatisation shares.
The new shares, sold by public offer at L5,400 without the L200 dividend,
were quoted on the London grey market yesterday at around L6,100.
MADRID gave credit to futures, foreign bourses and domestic bonds as the
general index rose 4.35 to 345.23 after a last minute spurt of buying.
Turnover rose to Pta32.14bn. There were specific interest rate hopes ahead
of tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting, and the interest-rate sensitive utilities
responded, showing the best gains of the day with Iberdrola, the most active
stock, Pta25 higher at Pta1,105.
TEL AVIV broke a four-session losing streak on buying by domestic pension
funds, the Mishtanim index shooting up by 13.2, or 6.75 per cent to 208.82.
This followed share price manipulation scandals which had dropped the blue
chip index by nearly 25 per cent from its 1994 high.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region depressed by lack
of foreign interest

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-taking following Monday's rally depressed share prices, and the
Nikkei 225 average finished marginally easier after moving within a narrow
range on technical trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 17.30 at 20,508.85 after a day's high of 20,654.17 in the
morning and a low of 20,458.85 in the afternoon. Early buying by foreign
investors supported equities, but the Nikkei 225 was caught later between
profit-taking and arbitrage buying.
Traders were not discouraged by the falls because volume was heavy, with
some 550m shares changing hands, against Monday's 514m. A Japanese fund
manager said that while share prices still looked expensive on a
price/earnings ratio basis, the risk of a fall in values had declined,
helped by the fact that the economy seemed to have bottomed out. Rises
outpaced falls by 550 to 449, with 147 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 3.07 at 1,642.94 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 0.43 at 302.31. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
3.75 to 1,363.71.
Machinery issues drew buying after the release of favourable data showing an
increase in industry orders. Minebea rose Y33 to Y748 and Nachi Fujikoshi Y9
to Y443.
The yen's retreat against the dollar supported high-technology issues. Sony
put on Y30 at Y6,330 and TDK Y50 at Y4,450. However, some issues which had
improved on the multimedia theme declined. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
dipped Y2,000 to Y952,000 and Fujitsu eased Y10 to Y1,040.
Mining issues, which had risen in tandem with the gold price, were lower.
Mitsui Mining and Smelting declined Y9 to Y416 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y4
to Y928.
Banks rose on arbitrage buying, Industrial Bank of Japan firming Y10 to
Y3,290 and Sakura Bank Y60 to Y1,390.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 65.55 to 22,438.38 in volume of 172.7m
shares. Roundup
Weak turnover and declining share prices typified the region. Kuala Lumpur,
Jakarta and Karachi remained closed for holidays.
HONG KONG's turnover was down from HKDollars 3.9bn to a provisional
HKDollars 3.47bn, against figures of more than HKDollars 10bn in late-1993
when the market was booming. The Hang Seng index ended a net 116.51, or 1.2
per cent, down at 9,863.56 after an early 120-point gain.
US funds took profits and selling mainly hit blue chips, with Henderson Land
falling HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 47.75, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 58.50 and Hutchison Whampoa HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars
32.25.
TAIWAN saw turnover shrink to its lowest this year, down from TDollars
40.39bn to TDollars 34.29bn, as the weighted index finished 59.63, or 1.1
per cent, weaker at 5,274.24, just one point above its 1994 low.
The heavily weighted financial sector was among the biggest losers, with
China Trust and China Development down TDollars 2 apiece to TDollars 63.50
and TDollars 119 respectively. It was said that reduced buying by foreign
institutions was hurting the market.
COLOMBO blamed foreign inactivity or selling, local institutional
profit-taking and a drive for liquidity in the retail market as the
all-share index dropped a further 31.92, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,268.38.
Turnover expanded from Rs116m to Rs142.8m.
BOMBAY edged up, but brokers said that trade was virtually paralysed by the
implementation of a ban by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on
forward trading. The BSE 30-share index rose 11.06 to 3,758.28.
The SEBI, India's main regulator for capital markets, had said that the
carry forward, or badla system of trading, was leading to excessive
speculation, and that it would allow resumption of the system only if stock
exchanges implemented several measures to make trading more transparent.
NEW ZEALAND defied the regional trend, the NZSE-40 index moving ahead 27.98
to 2,249.41 as the market found support from stronger European bourses and a
more stable local bond market.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezuelan equities are upset by tax
proposal - Transaction costs could rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new tax proposed last week by the Venezuelan government covering most
debit transactions at domestic banks has sent tremors through the Caracas
stock exchange.
On March 9, Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, Venezuela's minister of finance,
presented a series of tax bills to congress, including a proposed tax of
0.75 per cent on debit transactions at banks that will primarily affect the
country's private sector.
On the same day, the Caracas index reacted with a 4.3 per cent decline, and
over the week retreated more than 10 per cent in local currency terms.
The index recovered more than 3 per cent on Monday, but at midday yesterday,
prices were beginning to weaken once more. The market underperformed the
region last year, showing a 14 per cent gain in dollar terms, while turnover
slipped by 28 per cent compared with 1992.
Although equity investors in Venezuela were - and are - worried about a
number of problems, the proposed debit tax, as it is now being called, has
given them a new headache.
The tax, still to be approved by congress, has also raised fears that
trading will move offshore and that foreign investors will find the
country's equity market less attractive.
With some exceptions, banks will deduct the tax from the accounts of
individuals or companies whenever they order a debit to their accounts,
including issuing cheques or making an electronic payment.
A stock transaction requires at least four cheques or debit orders, each of
which would be taxed under the proposal. The new levy would increase
transaction costs significantly for domestic investors, and would have an
even greater effect on foreigners.
Ms Norys Aguirre, president of the stock exchange - the Bolsa de Valores de
Caracas - has asked the government to exclude exchange transactions from the
proposed levy. She warned that investors, especially from overseas, would be
driven away, noting that the tax would have theoretically added more than
Dollars 54m to last year's transaction costs.
Brokers and investors are also worried that stock deals will simply move
offshore in an effort to avoid the tax. Ms Aguirre pointed out that a
similar tax in Argentina was eliminated soon after it was applied when the
authorities realised that much of that stock exchange's activities had moved
to Uruguay; many Argentinians also decided to carry out their daily business
activities in cash rather than cheques.
The government has tried to soften the impact of the debit tax by noting
that it will only be in effect until December 31 and that, originally, a tax
of 2 per cent had been discussed.
The new tax is a sign of the desperate fiscal situation of President Rafael
Caldera's administration, which took office on February 2. It is trying to
cope with an economy in recession, a large fiscal deficit, high inflation,
declining income from oil exports (one of its main sources of Treasury
revenue), a banking crisis and other problems. It also hopes to raise
additional revenues through a proposed luxury tax and aims to reduce income
tax evasion.
Another tax initiative involves lifting the ceiling on corporate and
individual income tax from 30 per cent to 34 per cent. While this is not a
crippling increase, businessmen generally are unhappy as they work their way
through the second year of a recessionary economy.
The failure last January of Banco Latino, the country's second largest bank,
created an unexpected problem for the new government and provoked crises at
several other banks. The cash-strapped government has so far been forced to
supply Latino and other troubled banks with some Dollars 3bn in financial
assistance.
No-one can say for sure how the debt tax will fare in the new congress,
where the two political parties supporting Mr Caldera together hold under 25
per cent of seats in both the chamber of deputies and the senate.
The proposal got off to a bad start when Mr Henry Ramos, a spokesman for the
Democratic Action Party (AD), said the tax had never worked anywhere else.
Mr Caldera's parties need the support of one of the other three, larger
political blocs in congress in order to gain approval of the debit tax and
other tax proposals. So far, none of the three groups - AD, the Christian
Democrats or the left wing Radical Cause party - has indicated that it will
back the president.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady on mixed data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic data released in the US yesterday revealed hints of inflation but
had little impact on the dollar, which has already factored in further
Federal Reserve tightening, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency failed to make a sustained break through the key technical
level of DM1.6975 and finished in London at DM1.6963, up from DM1.6898 on
Monday.
Boosted by a fall in Japan's bilateral trade surplus with the US in
February, the dollar was also firmer against the yen, closing at Y106.150
from Y105.880. New York trading ended with the dollar at DM1.6960 and
Y106.05.
In Europe the recovery from recent interest rate pessimism continued, with
both sterling and Euromark futures rising across the yield curve. Market
speculation is that the Bundesbank will today announce a more generous cut
in its repo rate than the three basis points of the last two weeks.
The dollar weakened initially after the release of fairly modest inflation
data which appeared to postpone the need for higher US interest rates.
Although the headline figure showed February producer prices up by 0.5 per
cent, this fell to 0.1 per cent when the volatile food and energy sectors
were excluded. Cold weather in February pushed fuel bills to exceptional
levels.
The industrial production numbers released a little later, however, lent
support to the US currency. February industrial production rose 0.4 per
cent, against expectations of no change, while capacity use was 83.4 per
cent, against an 83 per cent forecast.
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the capacity
utilisation measure had caused concern. 'We are almost at the level at which
in the past we have seen inflation pressure build in the US.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, endorsed this
view, saying 'inflation pressures are bubbling below the surface' and that
there was nothing in the data to prevent the Fed from tightening if it
wishes.
Mr Cocker said the muted response of the dollar was explained by the market
already having factored in a rise in US interest rates. Mr MacKinnon said
the figures contained nothing new for dollar bulls. He predicted that the
dollar 'will find it very difficult to make progress against the D-Mark from
now on'.
Japan's February trade figures offered some solace for dollar bulls, showing
an unadjusted 0.9 per cent decline in the February surplus with the US from
a year earlier.
This positive note was promptly offset by comments from Mr Mickey Kantor,
the US trade representative, showing that the US would continue to play
tough over the trade talks. 'Our trade and economic relationship, a key
priority of the Clinton administration, is in serious disrepair,' he said.
The D-Mark was mixed in European trading ahead of today's repo announcement.
It was unchanged in London against the Belgian and French francs at BFr20.60
and FFr3.398 respectively. It was weaker against the Italian lira, at L985.4
from L988.1, and firmer against the Spanish peseta, finishing at Pta82.02
from Pta81.94.
Increased optimism about the pace of monetary easing was evident in the
Euromark futures. The June contract firmed four basis points to 94.60 and
the December contract 10 points to 95.06.
Analysts said German call money, in the 5.85 to 5.90 per cent range was also
helping, in that it indicated the market could accept a 6 to 7 basis-point
cut without difficulty.
Call money is now below the repo rate, which is 5.94 per cent. The
Bundesbank yesterday announced that it would be implementing another
variable rate repo.
Some observers were more aggressive in their forecasts, with Citibank's Mr
MacKinnon saying he 'would not be surprised' if the repo fell to 5.75 per
cent. 'The strength of the D-Mark gives the Bundesbank a chance to put
through quite a handsome repo cut.'
One factor likely to have a bearing on the size of the cut is the reportedly
easy liquidity position of the banks, which may have encouraged lower bids.
Sterling showed little reaction to the CBI's distributive trades survey
which showed a slow-down in retail sales growth. It eased slightly against
the dollar to Dollars 1.4915 from Dollars 1.4945, but was firmer against the
D-Mark, closing at DM2.53 from DM2.5254.
The CBI survey did have an impact in the futures market, with the June
sterling contract rising six basis points to 94.90 and the December contract
eight points to 94.60.
In the discount market the overnight rate maintained its firm tone of late,
trading around 6 per cent. Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at Union
Discount, said the Bank of England was continuing to have difficulty in
clearing the shortage. He said this reflected a shortage of bills rather
than pressure from the Bank.
Yesterday the Bank provided Pounds 550m of late assistance after earlier
putting Pounds 658m of liquidity into the system. This compared with a
revised forecast of a Pounds 1.25bn shortage.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' papermakers find
themselves out of pocket - Buyers are reluctant to pay adequate premiums for
the chlorine-free product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environmental movement has for years pressed pulp and paper mills to cut
their use of chlorine, which they claim is necessary to produce strong,
bright paper.
A growing number of producers, especially in Europe, have gone all the way.
Sensing a strong resistance among their customers to environmentally harmful
processes, some mills have spent heavily on processes that completely
eliminate chlorine as a bleaching agent in pulp and paper production.
Questions are now being raised, however, whether the producers have gone too
far. Evidence is mounting that customers are reluctant - at least for the
time being - to put their money where their mouths are.
Chlorine-free papers are not commanding the premium prices producers
expected, and which are required to recoup their sizeable investments in a
pioneering technology.
Doubts about the market's willingness to pay for the ultimate in
environmentally friendly paper are especially evident in North America,
where the vast majority of producers is strongly resisting pressures to move
towards the elimination of chlorine from pulp-making processes.
Mr Matthew van Hook, vice-president of the American Forest and Paper
Association's pulp group, told the AFPA's annual meeting last week that 'the
jury is still out on the environmental impacts of totally chlorine-free
(TCF) processes themselves, not to mention their technological and economic
feasibility'.
Chlorine owes its popularity as a bleaching agent to its ability to remove
unwanted resins and fatty acids from wood pulp while leaving intact the
cellulose fibres required for paper-making.
But chlorine is also a heavy polluter, adding toxic by-products such as
dioxins and chlorinated organic compounds, known as AOXs, to pulp mill
effluent.
It has increasingly been supplanted as a bleaching agent by hydrogen
peroxide, supplemented in some cases by an ozone-bleaching process and by
enzymes.
Chlorine-free pulp is especially popular in Germany, where the environmental
crusade against the forestry industry is strongest.
Germany, Switzerland and Austria consumed almost 1.9m tonnes of totally
chlorine-free (TCF) pulp last year out of total European demand of about
3.1m tonnes. Jaakko Poyry, the Finnish forest-products consultancy, predicts
that European demand will jump to between 5m and 6m tonnes by the end of the
decade.
For the present however, supply exceeds demand. Prices for northern bleached
softwood kraft pulp, the industry staple, are currently around Dollars 450 a
tonne.
Mr Martin Granholm, president of Kymmene, the Finnish forest-products group,
says that the present premium for TCF pulp is only about 10 to 15 per cent,
which is well below the figure of some Dollars 130 a tonne that forestry
companies say they require to reimburse the extra expense of installing
non-chlorine bleaching equipment.
In a speech at last week's AFPA meeting, Mr Granholm said it was 'quite
probable that some over-capacity will be created in Europe for TCF pulps.
This is predicted to lower the price premium that TCF pulps have had'.
Only one mill in North America, a 700-tonnes-a-day facility in California
operated by Louisiana-Pacific, at present produces totally chlorine-free
pulp. One-fifth of its 1993 output was chlorine-free, and it is scheduled to
be in continuous TCF production by September 1995.
The mill's environmental benefits are undeniable. Its effluent has a hazy,
pale yellow tint, compared to the coffee-coloured waste spewed out by mills
using chlorine. The levels of toxic AOX and dioxins are so small as to be
virtually unmeasurable.
But Louisiana-Pacific is far from recouping its investment of about Dollars
100m. Weak demand forced the mill to close during the last few months of
1993. It reopened in January and produced TCF pulp for just over a month
before being shut down again on March 2. The company has yet to decide when
it will restart.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil seeks markets for orange
juice - US imports are expected to fall further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil, the world's biggest exporter of frozen concentrated orange juice
with a commanding 86 per cent share of the international market, will need
to step up its sales efforts in Europe and Asia to compensate for further
declines expected in exports to the US.
Mr Rogerio Braga, president of Cambuhy Citrus, one of Brazil's largest
orange-processing companies, believes that the country's share of the US
market is likely to fall to between 5 and 10 per cent by the end of the
1990s, partly as a result of the recently agreed North American Free Trade
Agreement. This compares with the heyday of Brazilian exports to the US in
the 1970s, when 60 per cent of Brazil's total production of frozen
concentrated orange juice was sold in North America.
'Florida and Mexico, which has been granted special tariff conditions under
Nafta, will certainly be able to supply almost all of North America's
demand,' he told an international fruit conference last week in Rotterdam.
Speakers at the conference, which was organised by the port of Rotterdam and
Rabobank, the Dutch bank that specialises in agri-business, said that the
world's fruit sector also faced challenges caused by changes in the way
fruit and fruit juices were marketed. Increasingly, fruit growers and food
retailers were attempting to eliminate 'middlemen' such as brokers, import
agents, packers and wholesalers.
Mr Braga said the decline in orange juice sales to the North American market
over the past few decades was probably irreversible, meaning that Brazil
would have to concentrate on Europe, already its biggest market, and on new
markets in Asia such as Korea.
In spite of sharp increases in exports to Europe, there was room for further
growth, he said, because consumption of fruit juice was barely half the US
figure of 29 litres a person a year. In some countries, such as France,
Italy and Spain, consumption is still in single digits.
Consumption in Asia is low in absolute terms but rising rapidly.
'It took us 15 years to see Europeans consuming orange juice at half the
levels of Americans,' Mr Braga said. 'We might be able to get south-east
Asia to that level in half that time.'
Besides shifts in trade flows, Brazil and other fruit producers are
grappling with the shake-up in traditional relations between food retailers
and food suppliers.
The rise of discount chains and 'own label' products in established
supermarkets has affected every link of the chain, from growers to packers.
'Retailers are cutting their fat and have put tremendous pressure on the
food processing industry,' Mr Braga explained.
At the Netherlands' largest supermarket chain, Albert Heijn, the trend was
towards concluding partnerships directly with growers of fruits and
vegetables, said Mr Krijn Dorsman, executive vice-president of
merchandising. 'There are too many links in the chain between supplier and
consumer,' he said, noting that every link pushes up the retail price of
food.
The Dutch supermarket group has therefore moved towards a policy of working
with one exclusive partner for every product or product group in the fruit
and vegetable sector. This partner undertakes to provide sufficient supplies
to cover the supermarket chains' needs.
Mr Fred Hofman, a board member of the Bremen-based Atlanta Group, one of
Germany's biggest fruit importers, told the conference he believed that
importers and brokers would continue to have a role to play.
He added, however, that they would need to concentrate more on providing
services, such as quality control and the arranging of
'environmental-friendly' transport and packaging.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Europe's farmers face stark
choice over production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European farmers face a stark choice before the end of the decade between
tighter restraints on the use of land and chemicals or the complete
abolition of price support.
This is believed to be the central message of a detailed strategy document
to be considered today by the council of the National Farmers' Union of
England and Wales.
The NFU's long-term strategy group, which produced the report, believes the
recent Gatt deal will lead to another shake-up of the Common Agricultural
Policy before 2000.
'Current CAP policies are not going to increase consumption or bring down
the production of cereals and beef sufficiently to allow the EU to meet its
obligations under the Gatt settlement,' it says. 'EU farmers are approaching
a fundamental policy choice.'
This runs counter to assurances from the European Commission and the UK
government that no further fundamental change will be needed in sectors
subject to current CAP reforms to comply with EU commitments under the Gatt
deal.
The report is understood to rule out the option of exit bonds, under which
current agricultural support systems would end overnight and farmers would
be compensated with a fixed, finite payment, which would be tradeable.
The strategy group says this could push up the EU's annual spending on
agriculture - currently Ecu29bn - by 60-70 per cent in the short term and
would be politically unacceptable because it would lead to high rural
unemployment.
It also dismisses the extension of output quotas - such as those on milk -
to new sectors, saying this would be complicated to administer and would
conflict with the general reduction in government intervention in industry.
The choice, therefore, would be between tighter controls on inputs - for
example, by increasing the amount of set-aside land or reducing the amount
of nitrogen used - or abolishing the link between support payments to
farmers and their production levels.
Farm incomes would be better protected under a system of input controls,
assuming these would continue to be accompanied by subsidised exports and
import tariffs. 'But they may not be sustainable (beyond the 1990s) if
future Gatt rounds force lower levels of border protection and export
subsidies,' says the report.
The decoupling option would expose EU farmers to competition with world
prices, putting the full burden of support payments on the taxpayer. The
report suggests EU cereal prices could fall by a further 30 per cent before
reaching world price levels and that this might entail an unacceptably high
level of compensation.
The NFU plans to consult its 100,000 members, as well as the government, the
wider agricultural industry, and other European farming groups, in the
difficult task of achieving a consensus on future strategy.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian rubber and tin output
decline further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's declining role as a commodity producer is highlighted by
statistics released here on 1993 rubber and tin production - two commodities
in which, until fairly recently, Malaysia led the world.
The Malaysian department of statistics says the country's total natural
rubber production in 1993 was 1.07m tonnes, a drop of 98,000 tonnes, or 8
per cent, from the 1992 figure. Within that smallholder output declined 7
per cent while estate production dropped 12 per cent.
Exports of natural rubber also dropped - by 9 per cent to 937,000 tonnes.
The decline in tin-in-concentrates production was sharper, by 28 per cent to
10,384 tonnes in 1993.
Malaysia's is industrialising fast and commodities are playing a decreasing
role in the overall economy. Serious labour shortages and low prices are
also forcing people to abandon labour intensive agricultural activities.
A surge in car sales in the US is being seen as the main reason for a rally
in natural rubber prices which, after several months in the doldrums,
reached a five-year high on far eastern markets last week. Traders say tight
supply due to prolonged monsoon rains in rubber producing areas has also
helped prices.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: German rate hopes spur big gains across
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds put on another strong performance yesterday,
boosted by hopes of a more rapid easing in German interest rates.
Firmer US Treasuries lent added support, although they underperformed their
European counterparts, Mr Ifty Islam, an economist at Merrill Lynch said.
The yield gap between the higher-yielding US 10-year benchmark and its
German counterpart widened to 39 basis points, from 30 basis points on
Monday and 24 on Friday.
Retail activity remained subdued, with investors awaiting today's allocation
of the Bundesbank's securities repurchase agreements, UK retail sales and
employment numbers, and US consumer price data.
However, some traders reported substantial buying of German, French and
Dutch bonds by US hedge funds.
Hopes for accelerated Bundesbank easing gave German bunds a strong boost,
with 10-year maturities gaining more than a point.
Looking to the Bundesbank's repo allocation, most dealers are calling for a
slightly larger drop in the minimum repo rate than the three-basis-point
declines of the last two weeks.
Most traders are betting on a reduction of between five and seven basis
points, with some calling for a 10-basis point ease.
The market was also abuzz with speculation over Thursday's Bundesbank
council meeting. As it is the last meeting before the central bank's Easter
break, there was some talk that it might announce fixed-rate repos at lower
rates for the following weeks. The next council meeting is scheduled for
April 14.
UK gilts also gained more than a point, boosted by strong bond markets
elsewhere and the latest Confederation of British Industry survey
in-dicating that UK retail sales slowed in February from January. Full sales
data will be released today, along with key employment numbers.
Meanwhile, traders expect the Bank of England to announce its next gilt
auction on Friday. Most are looking for an issue of medium-dated paper,
possibly the 6 per cent gilts due 1999. The June long gilt future rose 1 3/8
point to 113.
Italian bonds put on the strongest performance of the day, helped by the
successful five-year bond auction and short-covering in the futures market.
The June BTP future jumped 1.62 point to 112.17.
However, according to Mr Andre de Souza, market strategist at PaineWebber,
the rally 'was not investor-driven - it was more of a catch-up,' retracing
the losses of the recent global sell-off, when Europe's high-yielders
suffered most.
Japanese bonds weakened in Tokyo, pressured by a lacklustre two-year auction
and worries of further supply. However, they steadied in London trading. The
June JBG future dropped 0.68 point to 110.22 in Tokyo, but slipped only 0.02
point in London.
US Treasuries took some comfort from a keenly-awaited report on producer
prices. However, the positive sentiment was tempered by concern over
stronger-than-expected industrial production in February.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was ahead at 91
29/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.89 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/32 better at 99 3/8 , to yield 4.946 per cent.
Despite the gloomy mood of recent weeks, traders were able to look past a
disconcerting headline figure in the Labor Department's producer price
report. The overall index showed a 0.5 per cent increase, a little worse
than analysts had forecast, but most of that gain was attributed to a
weather-related 2.8 per cent jump in energy prices. The core PPI, excluding
energy and food, showed a tame 0.1 per cent rise, against expectations of
0.3 per cent.
Prices across the yield curve improved on the news, but slipped a little
after the government reported that industrial production had climbed 0.4 per
cent last month, twice what the experts predicted.
Nevertheless the market, considered by many analysts to have over-reacted to
the bearish economic fundamentals recently, quickly regained its stride.
Bond prices were close to their session highs late in the day, with added
support from an afternoon purchase of securities by the Federal Reserve. The
move, known as a coupon pass, carried no policy implications.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Rarity value helps launch New Zealand's
FRN deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's rarity value in the international bond market, combined with
the likelihood that Moody's is about to raise the country's credit rating,
ensured a favourable reception for its widely-expected Dollars 1bn offering
of five-year floating-rate notes (FRNs) launched yesterday.
Mr Alex Jurshevski, head of portfolio management at New Zealand's debt
management office, said the proceeds of the transaction would be used to
refinance maturing debt, and would allow the sovereign borrower to call
outstanding floating-rate debt.
He said New Zealand planned to call its Dollars 250m FRN offering due 1996
next week, and that it had already called an old issue of
sterling-denominated FRNs, worth the equivalent of Dollars 200m.
Mr Jurshevski said although New Zealand actively used its Dollars 3bn Euro
medium-term note programme, the government's intention to reduce the
country's NZDollars 66.7bn foreign debt meant it would be depend even less
on the Eurobond market for its funding in the future.
Mr John Orange, senior portfolio manager at the New Zealand debt management
office, said the government's strategy reflected its desire to reduce the
risk associated with foreign currency borrowing and its success in
developing New Zealand's domestic bond market.
Joint lead managers Morgan Stanley and UBS said around 80 per cent of the
notes had been sold by late afternoon. In eastern Asia, central banks and
government agencies were strong buyers of the notes, attracted by their zero
risk weighting for capital adequacy purposes.
Sales into Japan were limited, possibly reflecting a reluctance among
investors to take on new commitments ahead of the close of the financial
year at the end of this month. European sales were mainly to funds in
Switzerland, Germany, the UK and Italy.
The coupon on the notes, of three-month Libor less  1/8 , was in line with
market expectations. When the notes were freed to trade, they were bid at
the issue price of 99.78.
Hydro-Quebec is expected to launch a Dollars 500m offering of five-year
notes today, via CS First Boston. The notes are likely to yield around 15 to
18 basis points over Libor.
Pemex, the Mexican oil company, raised Dollars 400m in the FRN market in two
three-year transactions as part of a refinancing of a Dollars 1.5bn bank
facility. One transaction was structured as a 'volatility floater', which
offered investors the chance to improve their yield.
Standard  Poor's has raised its ratings on Citicorp and units and removed
them from credit watch. SP said the action reflected the progress the
company has made in improving its financial strength. SP raised the senior
debt rating to A from A minus, and the subordinated debt rating to A minus
from triple B plus.
Moody's has placed the long-term ratings of Italy's seventh-largest banking
group, Banco di Napoli, under review for possible downgrading.
It said Italy's continuing recession made the bank vulnerable to further
impairment of its asset quality. Banco di Napoli's long-term ratings are A2
for senior bank deposits and A3 for subordinated bank deposits and
subordinated debt.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Regulatory pact marks new era
in derivatives trade - The UK-US agreement comes at a vital time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's news of a pact to co-ordinate regulatory overseeing of
over-the-counter derivatives trading in the US and UK came as two of the
world's most influential groups of traders prepared to open annual meetings
in the US.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) opens it meeting
in Chicago today, while international derivatives regulators, and
representatives of the exchange-traded derivatives community are meeting in
Boca Raton, Florida.
Both organisations have put regulatory issues and international co-operation
at the top of their agendas. Although the two groups see themselves as
distinct and often at odds in competing for the world's risk-management
business, yesterday's regulatory announcement shows that the borders between
the two groups have blurred considerably.
The future, and the sustained growth of global derivatives trading - on and
off listed exchanges - hinges on the regulatory decisions of a variety of
countries. International bank regulators are busy formulating capital
adequacy requirements, disclosure rules, and special accounting that
includes transaction netting.
With their agreement, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the UK's
Securities and Investment Board, and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission have demonstrated they want to join the bank regulators'
discussion, and have put the over-the-counter swaps dealers on notice that
they (the regulators) must be reckoned with.
For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is facing
reauthorisation this year, its co-operative efforts with the SEC and the SIB
may help head off Congressional criticism of its handling of exemptions for
certain energy derivatives. Added to this is the fact that it has, at times,
seemed ill-prepared to deal with a truly global futures and derivatives
crisis.
After four years of fractious debate, Congress gave the CFTC limited
overseeing of OTC derivatives in 1992, and promised to revisit their
regulatory treatment this year. The CFTC's initiative with the SEC may give
legislators, who have grown to understand the value of derivatives, more
confidence in the agency.
Taken unawares by the securities regulators' initiative, ISDA leaders had
been bracing this week for the release of another regulatory study on the
derivatives business.
Washington's General Accounting Office is overdue to release an extensive
examination on the industry. The GAO is known for its tough and
controversial reports, and is not expected to soft-hand derivatives dealings
like reports by industry groups such as the Group of Thirty.
After a year of such reports, and much discussion by legislators and bank
regulators, the SIB-SEC-CFTC pact smacks of action and provides an agenda
for co-operation on global OTC derivatives regulation.

Aldus and Adobe Systems, the pioneers of desktop publishing software, are to
merge. They will form a half billion dollar company that will address a
broad range of electronic publishing applications.
Adobe will exchange 1.15 shares of its common stock for each share of Aldus
common stock. At current prices the transaction is valued at approximately
Dollars 525m.
'We are committed to achieving the cost savings necessary to make this
transaction non-dilutive in the first full year of the combined operations,'
said Mr John Warnock, chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems.
'We believe our two companies, each with a rich history of inventing
different aspects of the electronic publishing revolution, are simply much
stronger together - both technologically and financially - than we would be
by remaining separate,' said Mr Warnock.
Adobe and Aldus are widely recognised for having created desktop printing
and electronic publishing, which has grown into a Dollars 2bn industry since
the early 1980s.
On a combined basis, the companies had revenues last year of Dollars 520m
and more than 2,100 employees. For fiscal 1993, Adobe reported revenues of
Dollars 313m and net income of Dollars 57m, while Aldus reported total
revenues of about Dollars 207m and net income of Dollars 9.5m.

NKK, the Japanese steel company, plans a wide-ranging restructuring aimed at
reducing employees by a further 1,300 and increasing profits by Y175bn
(Dollars 1.65bn) over the next three years.
The company, which faces heavy losses this year, says the restructuring is
intended to return the company to profit so that it can resume dividends by
1995-96.
Earlier this month, it revised its earnings estimate for the year ending
this month and said that it expects pre-tax losses of Y25bn.
Under the plan, NKK will cut capital spending to a third of levels seen over
the past three years, or about Y140bn.
The latest job cuts are in addition to 3,200 announced last year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chinese group powers on with HK
float - Simon Holberton visits Dongfang, a leading maker of power generation
equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes nearly two and a half hours to travel the 59 kilometres from
Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan in China's south-west, to Deyang,
the home of Dongfang Electrical Machinery.
Through a landscape undergoing a familiar transformation from agriculture to
industry, the journey is enlivened by the anarchic quality of motoring in
modern China. But it is one which the managers of Dongfang, China's third
largest maker of power generation equipment, hope will not deter investors.
The company expects to be floated on the Hong Kong stock exchange next month
 -the eighth of the first nine companies which the Chinese government
nominated last year for listing outside China - with an issue of about 125m
'H' shares.
Nomura, the Japanese securities house which is the lead manager, estimates
that this offering to foreign investors, which is equal to 25 per cent of
Dongfang's capital, will raise about HKDollars 350m (USDollars 45m). A
slightly smaller percentage of the company will be issued in the form of 'A'
shares to mainland Chinese investors and listed on the Shanghai stock
exchange.
In the Hong Kong stock broker jargon, Dongfang is an 'infrastructure play',
a 'warrant' on the fast-growing Chinese economy. The company appears well
positioned. According to Dongfang, it has a 40 per cent share of the Chinese
market for hydroelectric power generating equipment and a 25 per cent share
of the country's steam turbine generator market.
Overall it has a share of 30 per cent of the Chinese power engineering
market - a market which still has plenty of room to mature. Electrification
touches only 67 per cent of households in China, compared with 80 per cent
in Thailand and 82 per cent in India.
Moreover, if China is to sustain economic growth rates of around 10 per cent
a year it desperately needs more electric power plants. On current trends,
demand for electric power is set to double between now and 2000. According
to Mr Jacky Chiu, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, this means adding
an extra 20,000MW of generating each year. But the gap between China's need
and its capacity to meet that need is large. The production capacity of the
three mainland manufacturers is only 10,000MW to 12,000MW a year.
'As the Chinese government has designated that most of the annual
requirement for power generation capacity should be satisfied locally, local
manufacturers have to increase substantially both production capacity and
technological levels in the next few years,' Mr Chiu wrote recently.
Underlining the need for rapid development of the power industry is the
decision of the Chinese government to offer foreign investors stakes in
other power companies. Recently 22 companies were nominated for foreign
(mostly Hong Kong) listings and among them is Harbin Power Plant Equipment
Group, China's biggest manufacturer of power generating equipment, as well
as four power supply companies.
Dongfang's managers say that increasing productive capacity and raising the
company's technological sophistication are the main benefits they see coming
from the listing in Hong Kong.
According to Mr Chen Weijian, general manager, Dongfang plans to invest
Yn920m (Dollars 105m) over the next three years in increasing the capacity
of Dongfang's works.
Of this, the lion's share (Yn670m) will go to upgrade its technology in
hydro power production. By 1997 it wants to increase production capacity of
its hydro generators to 1,600MW from 600MW. A smaller amount (Yn250m) will
be allocated to increase the production of steam turbine generators with
capacities of 300MW and 600MW.
Dongfang needs an infusion of capital for expansion. Its order book is full
until the end of 1996. Not only that but by that time China's biggest
hydroelectric development - the Three Gorges project on the Yangtze river -
is expected to be well under way.
When completed the Three Gorges will be the world's largest lake and
hydroelectric power system. In its first phase the project will consist of
26 700WM units. Although Dongfang will be just one of the suppliers to the
project company executives expect the Three Gorges to underwrite its future
for many years to come.
In pursuit of technology, the company is exploring joint venture
possibilities with European and North American power generation equipment
manufacturers. Dongfang is holding preliminary discussions with GE Canada
about a joint venture in hydroelectric power, and it recently signed a draft
memorandum of understanding with Siemens.
This gives the German manufacturer 51 per cent of a steam turbine assembly
and test factory. Siemens will put up DM26m for its share of the business
while Dongfang will provide the land and erect the factory. Executives
expect the joint venture to be operational in 1995.
As Mr Rao Fangquan, a deputy general manager, observed: 'The most important
aspect of a joint venture is not the capital but the technology, so our
company can develop.'

<TEXT>
Minebea of Japan and FAG Kugelfischer of Germany, the two ball bearing
manufacturers recently hit by heavy losses, are to supply each other with
bearings in order to reduce their investment and production costs.
Under the agreements - signed in Thailand, where Minebea has its largest
factory - Minebea will supply FAG with miniature and small ball bearings,
while FAG will supply Minebea with small and medium-sized bearings.
The two companies will also swap technical knowhow.
They said they would notify the European Commission of the deal to obtain
clearance under the European Union's competition rules.
Executives from Minebea, which is particularly strong in Asia, and FAG, with
its European base, said each company would continue to market products
separately using its own brands.
'Each company will benefit from the manufacturing strengths of the other,'
said Mr Goro Ogino, Minebea president, in a statement, 'and both companies
will be able to realise important cost savings at the capital investment and
manufacturing level'.
Mr Peter-Juergen Kreher, chairman of FAG's management board, said: 'Today's
agreements represent a vital opportunity for us both to ensure our ability
to deliver a wider range of ball bearing products at the lowest possible
cost.'
According to the deal, Minebea will supply bearings with an outer diameter
of up to 24mm, while FAG will supply those with diameters between 24 and
35mm.
Both companies have undergone extensive restructuring. Minebea's net loss
was Y61.21bn (Dollars 578m)in the year to September 30, 1993, while FAG
reported a net loss of DM439m (Dollars 260m) in 1992.

<TEXT>
Santos, the Adelaide-based oil and gas company, reports a near doubling of
after-tax profits to ADollars 219.3m (USDollars 157.5m) for 1993. In the
previous year, profit after abnormals was ADollars 112.7m.
In part, the sharp improvement was due to a turnround on abnormals. In 1993,
Santos booked a net gain of ADollars 34.9m, reflecting a ADollars 46.6m
surplus on the sale of the company's shares in Sagasco, which was taken over
by Boral last year, a ADollars 44.1m gain from tax-related matters, and a
ADollars 55.8m write-down of capitalisation exploration expenditure. In the
previous year, there was a ADollars 49.9m abnormal charge.
Santos also benefited from lower tax and interest charges, with the latter
falling to ADollars 38.2m from ADollars 50.3m. Earnings before interest and
tax in 1993 stood at ADollars 327.4m, marginally below 1992's ADollars
322.2m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three leading Finnish banks, struggling to recover from the country's
financial crisis, warned yesterday that they faced further big credit losses
after the Haka construction group filed for bankruptcy.
Unitas, the country's second largest banking group, said the collapse could
produce write-offs of up to FM450m (Dollars 81.89m), but it stressed that
this did not alter its forecast of a substantially reduced deficit in 1994.
It said its total exposure to Haka amounted to around FM1.2bn.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's largest bank, said it would suffer a loss
of no more than FM200m from the bankruptcy. It added that the amount would
be covered by a FM900m provision, taken last year, for unidentified bad
loans. Its claims on Haka companies total FM815m.
A third bank, Postipankki, estimated potential credit losses at FM300m,
although its total exposure amounts to just over FM800m. It said the nominal
value of its collateral was more than FM750m.
'The final credit and guarantee losses are dependent upon both the
successful liquidation of the collateral as well as the orderly completion
of on-going projects,' Postipankki stated.
Rautaruukki, the Finnish state-controlled steel group, yesterday unveiled a
FM144m profit after financial items for 1993, a sharp turnround on the
FM697m loss reported for the previous year.
It benefited from firmer steel prices, cost-cutting and the weaker Finnish
markka. But the result was held back by high financing costs, lower demand
in western Europe, and continued losses at the company's Transtech rolling
stock unit. The group said it would not pay a dividend for the third
consecutive year.
Operating profits after depreciation were FM829m, or 11.8 per cent of sales
of FM7.01bn. This compares with profits of FM454m on turnover of FM6.50bn a
year earlier.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: NKK to cut 1,300 more jobs in
restructure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NKK, the Japanese steel company, plans a wide-ranging restructuring aimed at
reducing employees by a further 1,300 and increasing profits by Y175bn
(Dollars 1.65bn) over the next three years.
The company, which faces heavy losses this year, says the restructuring is
intended to return the company to profit so that it can resume dividends by
1995-96.
Earlier this month, the company revised its earnings estimate for the year
ending this month and said that it expects pre-tax losses of Y25bn.
The company is being forced to pass its dividend for the first time since it
was stock market listed in 1949.
Mr Shunkichi Miyoshi, president, said NKK aimed to increase its ratio of
profits to sales in the engineering division to 5 per cent from the current
3 per cent.
Under the plan, NKK will cut capital spending to a third of levels seen over
the past three years, or about Y140bn.
Steelmaking operations will be streamlined by reducing the product range,
integrating production of some products at one plant and shifting production
of other products to an affiliated electric furnace steel maker.
The latest plan brings the total number of employee cuts to 4,500. Last
year, NKK said it would reduce employee numbers by 3,200 by fiscal 1995.
Reductions would be achieved through transfers to subsidiaries, cuts in
graduate employees and natural attrition.
NKK expects to continue its operations in electronics and property
development which are two areas the company has been working in.
It also hopes to increase its involvement in south-east Asia where it is
considering local production of steel or joint ventures depending on the
needs of each particular country.
The restructuring plan is not expected to affect National Steel, the US
company in which NKK has a 50 per cent equity stake.
National Steel itself is beginning to enjoy the fruits of its own
restructuring, Mr Miyoshi said, and NKK hopes to support the running of
National Steel by its US management.

R. H. Macy, the New York-based retailer operating under Chapter 11 of the US

quarter as cost-cutting took effect.
While sales during the period ending January 29 slipped Dollars 40m from a
year before, to just under Dollars 2bn, Macy's lifted net income to Dollars
60.5m, from Dollars 8.9m. Selling and other overhead costs were Dollars 68m
lower than a year before.
Cashflow, though still well below levels seen in the late 1980s, also
continued to show a recovery. Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation
in the quarter were Dollars 227m, up from Dollars 141m.

Nike, the US athletic footwear and apparel marketer, yesterday posted a
sharp downturn in revenues and earnings for its third fiscal quarter.
The poor performance reflected lagging US sales of its mainstay line of
basketball shoes, which have fallen out of fashion with young people over
the past year.
Net income in the three months to the end of February amounted to Dollars
63.2m, or 85 cents a share, well below last year's Dollars 89.4m, or Dollars
1.16.
Revenues dropped 10 per cent to Dollars 871.8m, against Dollars 972m last
time. In the US, sales were down 14 per cent at Dollars 562m. International
revenues dipped 2 per cent to Dollars 260m, but would have shown a 4 per
cent improvement if the effect of currency fluctuations were excluded.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in CTC, the Chilean telecommunications group, were suspended in New
York and Santiago yesterday after Chilean regulatory authorities recommended
sharp cuts in fixed-rate telephone tariffs.
In New York, where CTC trades a quarter of its stock via American Depository
Receipts (ADRs), it fell 15.75 to 100.5, while in Santiago shares were down
8.32 per cent to 2,700 pesos.
Trading in Santiago was suspended for two days and halted in New York
pending news from the company.
CTC said it had lodged a complaint with the General Comptroller and would
seek to have the five-year tariff cuts declared illegal. Mr Claudio Garcia,
chief financial officer of CTC, said: 'We feel that we have a good chance to
correct the decree and that the government will correct some of these basic
errors.'
Tariff proposals submitted by the ministry of transport and
telecommunications would have a 'negative impact on its 1994-1998 business
plan', he said.
Potential loss of income to CTC from the proposed tariff structure is
calculated at Dollars 50m by Salomon Brothers, which downgraded the stock
from a buy to a hold. Salomon analyst Mr Alfredo Viegas said: 'CTC had been
expecting a slight increase; instead the government decreed sharp 30-40 per
cent decreases.'
Mr Viegas expected the impact on CTC's 1994 results to be 'large and
negative', predicting flat profits of around Dollars 240m instead of the
hoped-for 18 per cent growth.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: IBM chief expects a gradual
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive of International Business
Machines, sees no quick fix for the computer company's financial woes. In
the annual report to shareholders, Mr Gerstner says that IBM will recover
'over time'.
'It won't all happen overnight, but we are making significant progress,' Mr
Gerstner says in a letter addressed to 'Dear Fellow Investor'. He
acknowledges, however, that 'you wouldn't know it from looking at the
financial results for the year (1993).'
IBM earlier reported net losses for 1993 of Dollars 8.1bn on revenues of
Dollars 62.7bn. In 1992 the company recorded a Dollars 5bn loss on sales of
Dollars 64.5bn.
Mr Gerstner charges that the company 'failed to keep pace with significant
change in the industry'. It 'has been too bureaucratic and too preoccupied
with our own view of the world. We have been way too slow getting new things
to the market,' he states.
'We believe we can fix these problems because they are caused by us and not
factors outside our doors,' says Mr Gerstner, directly contradicting past
statements by senior IBM managers who blamed IBM's problems on economic
pressures and market turmoil.
Mr Gerstner, who last July stated that 'the last thing IBM needs right now
is a vision,' now believes that 'strategy is particularly important for
IBM'. He is expected to begin to reveal those strategies at an analysts
meeting later this month.
IBM's plans, announced last July, to reduce its workforce by 35,000 by the
end of 1995, are unchanged. 'Based on current business conditions, we think
that's about the right number,' Mr Gerstner says.
Financial data revealed for the first time in the annual report point to
IBM's mainframe computers as the crux of its problems. Revenue from
mainframe computer hardware declined 27.6 per cent last year, to Dollars
10bn, while personal computer sales increased 23.3 per cent to Dollars
9.7bn.
The company's data storage products division reported a precipitous 18.2 per
cent revenue decline to Dollars 5.1bn, while services revenues rose 32 per
cent to Dollars 9.7bn.
The report also shows a sharp decline in European sales over the past year,
with sales in the US and Asia Pacific regions increasing slightly.
Having outstripped the US for the previous two years, European revenues fell
about 13 per cent to Dollars 21bn last year, from almost Dollars 24bn in
1992.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Brazilian mining group prospects
for joint ventures - Companhia Vale do Rio Doce is seeking international
partners through its ADR programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new American Depositary Receipt programme launched by Companhia Vale do
Rio Doce (CVRD), the world's largest iron ore exporter, is meant to be a
first step in a plan to finance new joint ventures with foreign companies.
The basic programme, under which the company's ADRs will be traded in the US
over-the-counter market, is likely to lead to a new equity offering in the
US next year.
This should help fund joint ventures with foreign companies, particularly in
the pulp sector. The projects will need heavy capital investment in their
early stages.
Mr Anastacio Fernandes Filho, financial director, says the company embarked
on the ADR programme, launched last week, to attract foreign investors, and
to increase its international profile and share liquidity. Currently
foreigners own about 3 per cent of the capital.
'It will be easier to issue bonds or other securities with a wider investor
base,' he says.
Created during the second world war by Brazil, the US and the UK to supply
the Allies with iron ore, and later taken over by the government, CVRD has
always been regarded as an exception to Brazil's other federally-controlled
giants.
While Brazilian governments considered areas such as telecommunications and
oil production as strategically important, and took charge of key
appointments, CVRD was given greater autonomy so that it could compete in
international markets. As a result, its management has generally been more
independent of political pressures.
Its strategy has been to exploit its huge landholdings and deposits by
diversifying into other minerals, such as copper and gold. It has also moved
into areas such as pulp and infrastructure.
The company's policy has usually been to grow through joint ventures with
Brazilian and foreign companies, often offering exploitation rights towards
the cost of the project.
These joint ventures, mainly in pulp, copper, kaolin and aluminium, have
planned capital investment of about Dollars 1.5bn over the next five years.
'CVRD has not neglected its iron ore business, and has taken minority shares
in areas where it lacks experience,' says Ms Lika Takahashi, a research
director with brokers Baring Securities Brasil.
Despite the company's strong natural advantages and efficient management, it
has been hit by the world slump in commodity prices.
Net profits for the year to the end of December 1993 fell 12 per cent to
Dollars 262m, while net sales were down slightly at Dollars 2.15bn. The
company was also affected by increased interest costs on a yen loan at its
Albras aluminium joint venture. The appreciation of the yen against the
dollar contributed to a loss of nearly Dollars 100m.
CVRD's rail and port network has now been developed to generate profits from
outside users. The transport sector was its second-largest revenue source in
1993, providing 16 per cent of net sales. Iron ore and pellets still provide
the majority of sales, accounting for 57 per cent last year.
Excluding the results of the yen appreciation and government tax credits,
profits were about Dollars 200m, according to Ms Takahashi, who expects this
figure to reach about Dollars 450m by 1996 if commodities prices recover.
Partly because of the price slump, CVRD's shares appreciated by only 44 per
cent in dollar terms last year, compared with an index gain of more than 100
per cent for the Sao Paulo stock exchange.
Following the launch of a restructuring programme in 1990, CVRD's workforce
has been cut by a quarter to less than 18,000. Analysts expect continued
improvements in efficiency, especially since the company won increased
operational independence from the federal government, which still owns 51
per cent of shares, in 1992.
CVRD's restructuring followed a worrying pile up of debt in the late 1980s.
It switched 25 per cent of its debt from the expensive and short-term local
market to longer-term paper in international markets. Its current
outstanding debt is about Dollars 1.5bn, a debt-to-equity ratio of 25 per
cent, according to the company. However, very large debts in joint ventures
such as the Albras aluminium project are not consolidated.
According to analysts, the company will be open to criticism while it
remains government-controlled. Although CVRD's management believes
privatisation is inevitable, it is beset by political difficulties and has
fallen off the agenda ahead of October's presidential elections.
Sao Paulo-based mining consultant Mr Juarez Fontana dos Santos praises CVRD
as an efficient and low-cost producer.
Nevertheless he says the company remains over-centralised and bound by
government-imposed restrictive legislation on public tenders that slow down
decisions and purchases.
However, he maintains the company is attempting to become more flexible, and
that more independence may be achieved if changes are approved under a
congressional review of the constitution. This is under way, but may not be
completed this year.
He says the company's priorities for this year are to develop its rail
transport network by forming a group to bid for the privatisation of part of
the federal railway system.
It also intends to be more aggressive in its main iron ore market. Last
month, CVRD cut its ore prices to Japan, its largest market, in response to
discounts offered by Australian competitors. 'This year we'll be more
aggressive, offering quicker delivery and better quality for certain kinds
of ore,' says Mr Fernandes.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Avesta aims to raise SKr600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British steel producer, yesterday announced a
SKr600m rights issue to back a programme of investments and restructuring
designed to strengthen the group further after cutting losses sharply in
1993.
The company, formed in late 1992 from a merger of Avesta with the stainless
steel interests of British Steel, said losses after financial items were
reduced to SKr98m (Dollars 12.48m) last year from SKr574m in 1992. Sales
were up 20 per cent to SKr14.2bn.
It said the improvement came in spite of generally weak demand, especially
for its cold rolled products, hot rolled steel plate and tubes.
The reduced losses were attributed chiefly to merger synergies, the fall in
value of the Swedish and British currencies and reduced employers
contributions and energy taxes in Sweden.
No dividend will be paid, as was the case last year.
In January the company secured a five-year syndicated bank loan of Dollars
268.75m. The new financing will bolster Avesta Sheffield - 40 per cent owned
by British Steel - as it implements a SKr600m investment and restructuring
plan, provision for which was made in the 1993 accounts.
The plans include investment in a new continuous plate production plant in
the US and the upgrading of melting shops in Sheffield and Avesta.
A melting shop in Degerfors in Sweden is to be closed down.
Avesta Sheffield said overcapacity in Europe continued to depress short and
medium-term prospects for stainless steel, but stronger demand in the Far
East and the US supported a forecast of long-term growth in consumption of
4-5 per cent a year.
The company's investment and restructuring plan should give a quick return
by increasing productivity, reducing lead times and improving costs, it
said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chairman of LSE makes pitch for
Chinese custom
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong pitch for Chinese companies to choose London when seeking an
overseas listing was made yesterday by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of
the London Stock Exchange.
Opening an investment seminar in Beijing, he told bankers, securities
managers and stock regulators that the London market had the breadth of
experience and liquidity to benefit Chinese companies seeking overseas
capital.
'Companies raise more money if they issue shares on a market like London's,
where there is much investor interest and liquidity,' said Sir Andrew.
The invisibles seminar, organised by the China-Britain Trade Group, was
partly aimed at countering a trend among Chinese companies to look first at
Hong Kong and New York when considering an overseas listing.
Some six mainland companies have listed in Hong Kong in the past year or so,
and one of these - Shanghai Petrochemical - secured a joint listing in New
York.
Another 22 Chinese companies, including a number from the power sector, are
under consideration for overseas listings. Several have indicated an
interest in floating their shares in London.
Sir Andrew, who will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai
stock exchange to facilitate co-operation in trading and listing, said the
London exchange would rationalise listing requirements to eliminate
differences.
Seminar organisers said there was a good response from Chinese participants
who indicated they had not been aware of the extent of business on the
London market where some 200 new companies sought listings last year,
raising Dollars 38bn in equity capital.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Mutual fund takeover bid lights
up Wall Street - Richard Waters examines the implications of the uninvited
offer from GE Capital for Kemper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a second big takeover in the mutual fund business in the US
in a matter of months lit up Wall Street yesterday.
Shares in Kemper, the Chicago-based asset management, life insurance and
broking company, leapt by 50 per cent, or Dollars 20 7/8 , from Monday's
close on an uninvited bid from GE Capital.
The sharp move pushed Kemper's market value up to nearly Dollars 2.5bn,
above GE Capital's offer valued at Dollars 2.2bn. It signalled Wall Street's
belief that either the General Electric subsidiary would have to offer more
or the approach would prompt a rare bidding war for the financial services
company.
The bid approach from GE Capital follows Mellon Bank's Dollars 1.8bn
acquisition of Dreyfus, which marked the most aggressive move yet by a US
commercial bank to enter the booming funds business. The share prices of
other mutual fund groups also jumped yesterday, on expectations of further
deals. Franklin Resources, for instance, rose Dollars 3/4, to Dollars 47
3/4.
GE's approach came in a letter from Mr Jack Welch, chairman of the US group,
to Mr David Mathis, his opposite number at Kemper. Although written on March
2, it was only made public by GE yesterday in an apparent move to put
pressure on Kemper's board to accept the deal.
It could also be designed to force a decision before any rival suitor has a
chance to make a move. The market has been rife with rumours of an approach
for Kemper since the Dreyfus deal.
Banco Santander, the Spanish bank which took a 3 per cent stake in Kemper in
the late-1980s, is one name frequently mentioned - although its potential
involvement in a rescue bid for domestic rival Banesto could give its
management more than enough to think about in the months ahead.
Other US domestic banks, seeking to emulate Mellon, are also seen as
possible bidders.
GE's approach has caught Kemper's management in an unenviable position. The
company is only just emerging from a period overshadowed by problem real
estate investments.
Last year, Kemper sold off its reinsurance operations, and earlier this year
completed its exit from the property/casualty business.
In the view of several analysts, it could be on the verge of a rebound in
earnings - although its stock price before GE's approach became public
seemed not to reflect this.
At around Dollars 40, the shares earlier this week were trading on a
multiple of around 12 to 13 times most analysts' expectations of earnings
this year, considerably lower than other companies in the sector.
Mr Michael Blumstein, of Morgan Stanley, estimates earnings this year of
Dollars 3.75 a share, rising to Dollars 4.40 in 1995 - a view echoed in a
recent research note from Allen Nadler at Merrill Lynch.
Ironically, it was the disposal of the reinsurance business which first left
Kemper vulnerable to a bid.
The sale involved the cancellation of most of the 38 per cent stake in
Kemper owned by the Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Company, wiping out a
potentially supportive holding.
It is not surprising that Kemper's management team, having dealt with the
problems of the early-1990s, have not welcomed GE's bid. 'They hate the fact
that someone else will come in and take the credit (for their efforts),'
said one person close to the company.
Kemper's business now comprises three parts: a mutual fund business, with
Dollars 44bn under management; a life assurance operation specialising in
annuity business; and a regional securities brokerage. The company abandoned
efforts to sell its underperforming securities arm last year, after it
failed to attract a high enough bid.
For GE Capital, a Kemper acquisition would provide a springboard into the
fastest-growing areas of the US retail investment business - mutual funds
and variable annuities.
Kemper has Dollars 70bn in all under management, which together with GE's
Dollars 75bn would create one of the US's biggest fund management groups.
In a clear attempt to win the backing of Kemper's management, Mr Welch in
his letter dangled the carrot of a consolidation of all the asset management
activities under the Kemper umbrella, run by its existing managers -
although under the wing of GE Capital.
The all-cash bid of Dollars 55 a share values the group's outstanding
ordinary shares at Dollars 1.8bn, and would be worth Dollars 2.2bn after
taking into account convertible preferred stock and stock options.
While leaning heavily on Kemper's board before it meets this Thursday, GE
seems unwilling at this stage to launch an all-out contested bid.
Such an attack would be extremely rare in the financial services business.
An unwanted deal would run the risk of driving away Kemper's best people.
It would also have to win the backing of state insurance regulators. In
addition, mutual fund groups have a powerful poison pill at their disposal:
the boards of each fund run by the group could vote to have their assets
managed by another company.
If that were to happen, a contested GE takeover would become a hollow
victory.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fannie Mae in scheme for
low-income borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday launched a
series of initiatives to provide mortgage financing to help low-income
families in the US buy their own homes. The plan involves boosting the
amount of 'targeted lending' to special groups by more than Dollars 140bn to
Dollars 1,000bn before the end of the decade.
Fannie Mae's scheme comprises a series of programmes aimed at providing more
information to potential homebuyers, making it easier for low-income or
disadvantaged families to win approval for a mortgage loan, and ending
racial discrimination in the lending process.
By the end of the decade, Fannie Mae hopes to have provided a total of
Dollars 1,000bn in financing to mortgage providers, and to have helped 10m
families buy homes.
The company is the largest provider of mortgages in the US. It does not sell
mortgages directly to homebuyers, but invests in mortgages sold by mortgage
companies, savings and loan institutions and banks.
Fannie Mae will direct the programmes at low and moderate-income, and
minority families, new immigrants to the US, people living in inner-city
areas or neglected communities, and people with special housing needs.
The programmes Fannie Mae plans to introduce include: multilingual
television, radio and print advertising; support for the government's
campaign against racial discrimination in mortgage financing; second and
third reviews of rejected mortgage applications and counselling to improve
families' chances of securing mortgages; new financing tools specially
designed to help the elderly, rural families, native Americans and other
groups to secure mortgages for new homes or renovations; and investment in
technology to speed up the mortgage approval process.

up 8% for year

<TEXT>
Consolidated profits at Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, rose by
8 per cent last year to BFr11.6bn (Dollars 333m), up from BFr10.7bn in the
previous 12 months.
Mr Ferdinand Chaffart, chief executive, yesterday claimed that all the
branches of the bank's activities had contributed to the growth, which was
broadly in line with market expectations.
However, he noted that the bank had benefited in particular from falling
interest rates which had boosted financial markets and stock exchanges.
In spite of an overall drop in loans, private sector lending rose by 4.5 per
cent last year. Meanwhile, gross income had risen by 14 per cent as a result
of an expansion of the group's investment funds and foreign exchange
activities, coupled with the realisation of capital gains on government
bonds and the bank's recent sale of its stake in ABN-Amro, Mr Chaffart
added.
The board of directors has proposed an increase in net dividend to BFr340
from BFr320. With the bank hoping to benefit further from a weak D-Mark, in
spite of uncertainties about the scope for further German rate cuts, Mr
Chaffart said he remained 'optimistic' about the prospects for further
growth next year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft regroups to get closer
to its customers - The world's most profitable software company is to
refocus on global marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest
personal computer software company, has nightmares in which his competitors
outsmart and overwhelm him in his bid to dominate the software business in
the home and office.
That fear must have played a part in the decision, announced in the US last
night, to reorganise Microsoft from top to bottom.
A memorandum to employees signed by Mr Gates, Mr Steve Ballmer and Mr Mike
Maples, who collectively make up Microsoft's 'office of the president'
spells out the worry: 'We are trying to reach new customers and partners.
Competitors like Lotus, Novell and Electronic Arts are more focused.
'To continue to be a leader we need to innovate not only in our products but
in our sales, marketing and operations. We cannot just follow and react to
what others are doing.'
Lotus Development Corporation developed the best selling spreadsheet 1-2-3
and market leading software for workgroups 'Notes'. Novell markets the most
popular PC networking software.
What is striking about Microsoft's decision to reorganise is that, unlike
other companies forced to restructure because of falling sales or trading
losses, it remains the world's most profitable software company.
In 1993 it reported net income of Dollars 953m on sales totalling Dollars
3.75m.
Its success is based on a broad range of market leading software packages,
but especially on MS/DOS and Windows, the operating systems used by 90 per
cent of the world's 100m personal computers.
Microsoft says that if it is to continue growing, it needs a fast,
responsive organisation focusing on the customer's needs.
Among the changes called for in the plan are:
Microsoft's core technologies must be shared across the company to achieve
economies of scale and offer customers greater consistency.
The company's product strategy has to be simplified. The memorandum says:
'We are overloading the market with lots of complex messages. We need to
develop clear themes that pull together what we say about our products.'
This is taken to be a reference to confusion in the marketplace over
Microsoft's advanced Windows N/T operating system and its derivatives
codenamed Daytona and Cairo.
Products are to be grouped in seven divisions: personal operating systems,
business systems and workgroup applications, desktop applications, consumer
applications, software developer systems, advanced consumer technology and
on-line services.
Sales activities will be grouped into three customer units to give greater
customer focus: 'We will align all worldwide sales and marketing people with
one of three customer types: end users, organisations, or other equipment
manufacturers. People within these customer units will live, eat and breathe
with their customers,' the memorandum says.
A renewed focus on the competition: 'We must understand not only
competitors' products but also their sales strategies, marketing strategies,
localisation strategies and so on. We must be aggressive in taking
legitimate competitive actions.'
The memorandum goes on to say the company has to make decisions faster and
be more efficient in marketing, sales and support: 'It must be clear that it
is better to take action, make mistakes and be forgiven than to wait and ask
for permission.'
The memorandum makes clear the company is planning on a global basis.
In the past, product marketing groups were focused primarily on the US
market and subsidiaries had to develop their own marketing programmes.
'In the future we will create global marketing programmes that can be
efficiently deployed in local geographies.'
The company denied that subsidiaries would become less independent, arguing
that it would collect information from its subsidiaries in developing global
marketing strategies.

Royale Belge, Belgium's largest insurance group, yesterday said that an
expansion in its life insurance businesses had helped push profits up by 11
per cent last year.
Consolidated profits for 1993 were BFr4.9bn (Dollars 94m), up from BFr4.4bn
in the previous year. Turnover rose above BFr100bn for the first time, to
BFr104.4bn in 1993.
The board is proposing a dividend of BFr160 a share, up from BFr147 the
previous year. Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, chief executive, said that the
improvement had been helped by the healthier financial climate and the
restructuring programme which the company has implemented in the past four
years.
This restructuring, which is expected to lead to a 20 per cent cut in the
workforce over eight years, has divided the group into two specific
operations, one of which deals with independent brokers, the other with
salaried agents.

<TEXT>
Norway's Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's largest pulp and paper producers,
is making a two-step share issue to raise around NKr800m (Dollars 73m).
In the first step, NKr400m is to be raised through a 1-for-10 rights
offering, with preferential rights given to existing shareholders to
purchase shares of the same class. A subscription price of NKr150 per share
has been proposed.
The second step involves authorisation of the board to issue up to 2,650,000
restricted non-voting 'B' shares, aimed at international investors, to raise
another NKr400m.
'In order to broaden the company's investor base, it will be proposed that
existing shareholders waive their preferential rights for the international
offering,' Norske Skog said.
Mr Jarle Langfjaeran, a company executive, said the proceeds of the two
offerings would increase financial flexibility to undertake a number of
planned projects.
He said that in 1994, Norske Skog intended to build a new de-inking plant in
Norway used for the treatment of waste paper. Construction is to begin later
this year. At the domestic Tofte chemical pulp mill, there is a programme to
gradually convert the mill to total chlorine-free pulp. Elsewhere in Norway,
a new saw line is to be installed at an existing mill, while there are a
number of other minor projects planned for this year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bayer result raises hopes for
German chemicals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hopes of an end to the German chemicals industry's four-year profits slump
were raised yesterday by the release of better-than-expected earnings
figures from the Bayer group.
In line with the company's forecasts, the dividend was left unchanged at
DM11, and sales fell only 0.5 per cent to DM41bn (Dollars 16bn).
Although Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, suggested in January that earnings
would be better than he had forecast, net income of DM1.37bn, down 12.2 per
cent, and pre-tax profits of DM2.35bn, down 12.6 per cent, were better than
many analysts expected.
Last year, when Bayer reported pre-tax profits and sales down 19 per cent
and 2 per cent respectively in the first three-quarters of 1993, management
said it expected a fall of 20 per cent in gross earnings for the full year.
The group, which had predicted flat profits in 1994, is likely to offer a
clearer view of earnings prospects at its annual press conference on Friday.
Bayer has traditionally fared better in recession than its main domestic
rivals, Hoechst and BASF - both of which announced a DM2 cut in their 1993
dividends - because of its strength in healthcare and relative lack of
reliance on basic chemicals. The drugs businesses generate some two-thirds
of total profits.
True to form, healthcare sales were 5 per cent up at the nine-month mark,
despite reductions in domestic health services.
Yesterday's figures were released after a meeting of the supervisory board,
which also agreed to propose an end to voting restrictions, imposed in 1975,
at this year's annual meeting.
The limit, restricting shareholders' voting rights to 5 per cent regardless
of the size of their holdings, was raised at last year's meeting, when the
management hinted it was prepared to consider change.

ISS, the industrial cleaning group which plans a listing on the New York
Stock Exchange this year, reported an increase in pre-tax profits to DKr593m
(Dollars 60m) in 1993 against DKr377m in 1992.
Net profits advanced to DKr462m from DKr266m, while turnover was up at
DKr13.30bn from DKr11.35bn, of which 38 per cent was in the US, 35 per cent
in Scandinavia and 24 per cent in Europe. Group employment increased to
125,900 from 115,000.
The group said the 17 per cent advance in turnover and 13 per cent increase
in operating profits took place while important markets such as Finland and
Sweden were in recession and against a background of currency turbulence.
The Swedish and Finnish currencies depreciated against the krone by around
20 per cent.
The Dollars 93.5m acquisition of the National Cleaning Group of the US on
June 1 doubled the size of the group's North American operations. An
unchanged DKr10 per share dividend will be paid, but after a one-for-five
subscription issue last year the total pay-out increases to DKr51.9bn from
DKr43.3bn.
The East Asiatic Company, the trading group with extensive interests in East
Asia, moved back into the black with a net profit of DKr144m in 1993
compared with a loss of DKr1.18bn in 1992.
Profit after net financial items increased to DKr275m from a 1992 loss of
DKr128m. Sales were up at DKr11.12bn from DKr10.29bn for the companies
continuing in the group. The group has restructured over the past 18 months,
selling off its container line shipping services and the Plumrose food
processing companies in the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand.

restructuring charge

<TEXT>
Societe Generale de Surveillance, the Swiss inspection and insurance loss
adjusting group, reported a 1.3 per cent rise in net income in 1993 to
SFr196.1m (Dollars 91m) in spite of a SFr27.2m exceptional charge for
discontinued activities.
Earnings per share grew faster, 7.15 per cent, to SFr22.02 per registered
share and SFr110.10 per bearer share, due to the successful campaign last
year to buy back for cancellation 5 per cent of the share capital. The
directors have recommended a 7 per cent rise in dividends.
Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, SGS chairman, said the group looked forward to
the current year 'with confidence', expecting that the effects of internal
restructuring and the economic recovery in the US and the UK would boost
profits. Mr Serge Pahud, finance director, said no further restructuring
charges were expected this year.
Revenues last year were up 6.8 per cent to SFr2.6bn, thanks to 6.3 per cent
of internal growth, 1.5 per cent from acquisitions and a negative 1 per cent
from exchange rate adjustments. Operating income advanced 8.9 per cent to
SFr237.4m.
Mr Thierry Chereau, chief executive, said brisk business in Asia, Africa and
Latin America offset sluggish performances in Europe and North America.
Revenues from European countries were flat at SFr1.19bn, with growth in
eastern European countries preventing a decline. Revenues from North America
were up 9 per cent to SFr648.6m while income from the Asia-Pacific region
advanced 11.1 per cent to SFr562.7m.
Net financial revenues eased only marginally to SFr59m, in spite of the
downward trend of interest rates last year, but pre-tax profits dropped 1.8
per cent to SFr269.2m because of the restructuring charges.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Wolters Kluwer advances 23%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publisher which is expanding rapidly overseas,
posted a 23 per cent increase in net profit last year, with a large part of
the rise due to a recent string of foreign acquisitions.
The company, which said yesterday that it expected to expand into five more
European countries this year, saw net profit rise to Fl 318m (Dollars 165m)
from Fl 258m in 1992. Turnover grew to Fl 2.62bn from Fl 2.36bn, while the
dividend is to be raised to Fl 1.52 from Fl 1.32.
The importance of recent foreign expansion is reflected by the fact that
more than half of last year's 21 per cent increase in operating profit was
generated by companies acquired during 1993.
Mr Mijndert Ververs, chairman, said Wolters Kluwer, which specialises in
professional, scientific and educational publishing, hoped to be able to
announce deals in the Czech Republic and Hungary within the next few months.
The total spent on acquisitions in 1994 is likely to be less than the Fl
700m spent on acquisitions and fixed-asset investment in 1993, he said. But
in keeping with last year, acquisitions in 1994 would be financed from
internal resources.
Wolters Kluwer's biggest acquisition last year was the takeover of Sweden's
Liber Group, which fits the company's strategy of expanding in countries
that are poised to become increasingly involved with the European Union.
This policy also lies behind its interest in eastern Europe.
The company expects to see a further increase in 1994 results, in line with
its goal of achieving an average 15 per cent increase in profit per fully
diluted share in the years until 1996. In 1996, it hopes to generate 70 per
cent of its operating profit abroad, compared with 62 per cent in 1993.
Turnover in 1996 is projected to increase to between Fl 3.3bn and Fl 3.5bn.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banesto wins JP Morgan support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The caretaker board of Banesto believes it has won the support of J. P.
Morgan of the US for a major dilution of the troubled Spanish bank's equity
as part a rescue plan.
Backing from J. P. Morgan, which controls Banesto's biggest shareholder,
would remove a doubt hanging over Banesto's AGM, scheduled for March 26,
when shareholders will be asked to accept a 43 per cent write-down in the
par value of Banesto shares. It would also pave the way for the troubled
bank's re-capitalisation by the domestic financial sector.
J. P. Morgan advised Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former chairman dismissed by
the Bank of Spain in December after inspectors discovered the bank had
grossly over-valued its assets. J. P. Morgan engineered a large rights issue
for Banesto last year and, through the Corsair Fund that it manages, had
invested Dollars 175m of US institutional funds in the Spanish bank.
A spokesman for Banesto said yesterday that although J. P. Morgan had still
not delivered its support to the new board in writing there had been
fruitful and fluid high-level contacts in the past weeks with the US bank.
Relations with J. P. Morgan had been cool following Mr Conde's sacking.
The spokesman said there had been no contact with Mr Robert Mendoza, the J.
P. Morgan vice-president who introduced the Corsair Fund to Banesto and
masterminded the rights issue. He said J. P. Morgan's office in Madrid,
which had a limited role in advising Banesto's former management, had been a
party to the renewed contacts.
It is believed that the Corsair Fund could make a further investment in
Banesto's restructured equity base to remain a significant shareholder in
the bank. Under the proposed write-down and the subsequent
re-capitalisation, the Corsair's current 7.9 per cent holding in Banesto
will be diluted to 4.5 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong profits recovery at
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French utilities and communications group,
announced a strong recovery in profits in 1993 and said it plans to
restructure its construction and public works activities to strengthen their
position in international markets.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said that preliminary results showed net profits
of FFr800m (Dollars 93m) last year, more than double the FFr379m achieved in
1992 but still below the FFr1.17bn recorded in the previous year. Turnover
rose by about 3.5 per cent to FFr93.6bn.
According to Mr Monod, the improvement in results and signs of recovery in
the construction sector helped explain the group's decision to merge the
building and public works activities of its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose
subsidiaries.
The combined company, to be called Dumez-GTM, will have annual sales of
about FFr25bn and a workforce of about 35,000. According to the chairman, it
should allow the group to compete more effectively for significant
infrastructure and public works contracts expected in France, Europe and
south-east Asia. Industry observers, however, expressed caution about the
benefits.
Mr Andre Jarrosson, chairman of GTM-Entrepose, said the reorganisation
should be completed by the summer. Under the terms of the proposed
restructuring, Dumez-GTM will be held 50-50 by GTM-Entrepose and Dumez.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez will continue to hold 60 per cent and 100 per cent
respectively of GTM-Entrepose and Dumez.
The group said no job cuts would be involved in the reorganisation, and
there would be no direct effects on the consolidation and reporting of
earnings. GTM Entrepose, which also has non-construction activities such as
engineering and offshore contracting, will retain its market listing.
Shares in GTM-Entrepose fell by FFr28 to FFr480, reflecting concerns about
the possible impact on minority shareholders and a reduction in net profits,
from FFr202m in 1992 to FFr170m last year. By contrast, Lyonnaise des
Eaux-Dumez exceeded market expectations with its turnround from 1992,
pushing shares up FFr8 to FFr592.

McVitie's

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A large share of Poland's biscuit market yesterday fell to McVitie's, a
United Biscuits subsidiary, when the biscuit and snacks producer agreed to
pay Pounds 19.1m for 80 per cent of the San factory in Jaroslaw, the
country's last large biscuit plant still in state hands.
Last year Jacobs Suchard bought the Olza plant in Cieszyn, while Bahlsen, a
German snack producer, took control of Skawina, another biscuit producer in
southern Poland.
These purchases came as PepsiCo Foods International was developing its
bourse-listed Wedel chocolate factory, bought in 1991, into a salty snacks
producer which looks set to double its 1993 net profit of 330bn zlotys
(Pounds 9.7m) this year.
Both RJR Nabisco and PepsiCo bid for San, which reported a Pounds 1.8m net
profit last year, as did the French BSN food group which has yet to purchase
a snacks plant in Poland.
Mr Hartwig Conzelmann, of McVitie's said yesterday that his company was
planning to build on San's 20 per cent market share and 'dominate the
country through a new nationwide marketing net work'.
Yesterday's agreement also spoke of plans for expansion from San's base in
south east Poland into Belarus and the Ukraine and the company is
considering building a salty snacks plant.
McVitie's intends raising San's capital by Pounds 6.7m this year and
investing a further Pounds 8.4m over the next two years. It will be
preparing a prospectus for a Warsaw stock market listing within nine months
and the Pounds 6.7m capital increase could well come from the local capital
market. McVitie's has promised to retain a 51 per cent in San for three
years.
The Central European Trust advised the Polish government on the transaction
while McVitie's was advised by Schroders.
McVitie's bought Gyori Keksz, Hungary's largest biscuit company in 1991.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: A Pounds 50m magic wand from Ford - Plans
to revive the ailing Aston Martin Lagonda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US motor manufacturer, is planning to transform the fortunes of
Aston Martin Lagonda, the UK luxury sports car maker in which it acquired a
75 per cent stake in 1987.
Accounts filed at Companies House disclose for the first time the financial
scope of the project to develop a new range of Aston Martin sports cars, the
DB7, which are due to enter production next month.
Ford has injected Pounds 50m in new equity to fund the peak financing
requirements of the DB7 programme, in the process lifting its shareholding
to 99.5 per cent.
The DB7 programme has imposed a heavy burden on Aston Martin Lagonda's
finances.
The group's losses in the last two years - Pounds 18.9m in 1993 and Pounds
16m in 1992 - were incurred after charges to the profit and loss account for
the development of the DB7 totalling Pounds 13.7m in 1993 and Pounds 6.6m in
1992, including Pounds 2.1m for the original feasibility study.
The DB7 programme has led to a far-reaching reorganisation of the group.
The board now includes Mr Jackie Stewart, the former Formula 1 world
champion, Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, and Mr
Tom Walkinshaw, whose TWR motor sports engineering group has played a
significant role in the DB7 project.
The Aston Martin Lagonda group accounts disclose that JaguarSport, a 50/50
Jaguar/TWR joint venture of which Mr Walkinshaw is a director, was paid
Pounds 10.1m in 1993 and Pounds 5.3m in 1992 for providing engineering
services for the development of the DB7.
Jaguar is 100 per cent owned by Ford.
The new Aston Martin sports car, expected to sell for below Pounds 80,000,
is heavily dependent on outside suppliers.
Body panels and welded bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, a
subsidiary of the Mayflower specialist automotive engineering and design
group.
The bodies will be painted by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars' plant at Crewe,
Cheshire, and the cars will be assembled at the plant in Bloxham,
Oxfordshire, which has previously built the Jaguar XJ220 super car.
The plant will be taken over this year by Aston Martin Lagonda. The DB7
engines will be assembled by TWR.
Last year Aston Martin produced only 144 cars at its Newport Pagnell plant
in its traditional Virage/Vantage range, which sell from Pounds 134,000 to
Pounds 178,000, but the group's output is now forecast to increase fivefold
with DB7 production set to total 600-700 a year.
Output of the DB7 starts next month with deliveries beginning in the UK in
the summer and in the US and Canada in the autumn of 1995. Output next year
is expected to total 625.
While the DB7 has been under development the existing Aston Martin business
based on the Virage/Vantage range has been under heavy pressure as a result
of recession in the US and UK.
Turnover fell from Pounds 27.3m in 1990 to Pounds 20.8m in 1991 and Pounds
12.4m in 1992, although sales began to recover to Pounds 15.9m last year
with a pick-up in both the UK and the US. The workforce has been drastically
reduced to an average 285 last year from 359 in 1992, 448 in 1991 and 522 in
1990.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw beats forecast with Pounds
7.81m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evans Halshaw, the Birmingham-based motor distribution and vehicle
management group, yesterday delivered its promise of a fourfold increase in
1993 profits and prompted a 17p rise in the share price to 549p.
It announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.81m for the 12 months to December,
compared with Pounds 1.71m for 1992.
Last November, when the group bought TK Motor Group, it forecast 1993
profits of Pounds 7.5m.
Earnings per share climbed from 5.4p to 24.3p, providing cover of 1.86 times
for the increased dividend.
The proposed final is 9.2p (7.65p), making a total of 13p, against 11.25p
for 1992 when payments to shareholders were partially financed from
reserves.
Turnover rose from Pounds 341.5m to Pounds 404.7m as the new and used car
market revived. New car sales were 28 per cent ahead and used car sales 16
per cent ahead of 1992.
However, the staple source of Evans Halshaw's profits - the servicing, parts
sales and accident repair market - was flat until towards the end of the
year.
This after-market provided 62 per cent of group profits, compared with 70
per cent in 1992. There was no absolute decline of earnings from the
after-market, but its share of group profits fell because earnings from car
sales rose.
Capital investment, notably in a second motor village at Solihull, West
Midlands, where five dealerships are grouped together, totalled Pounds 5.1m
last year. Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman and chief executive, expects spending
this year to be slightly less.
'Across the group, car sales have been buoyant in the first two months of
1994 and our trading results are significantly ahead of the same period last
year,' Mr Dale said.
COMMENT
Evans Halshaw is riding up the economic cycle and its profits would no doubt
increase even if it did nothing except avoid silliness. In fact, it is
expanding into a fragmented market with costs already pared. It is now
obtaining the benefits of its investment of the last two years. Solihull
alone this year should sell 5,000 cars. It is developing other streams of
revenue like the sale of fleet management software. It is unrealistic to
expect another fourfold profits increase, but feasible to think of pre-tax
profits this year pushing towards Pounds 13m to give earnings per share of
about 40p. On a prospective multiple of less than 14, it looks as if they
have some way yet to motor, always providing that economic recovery is
sustained.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering leaps to Pounds 8.6m and
lifts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hall Engineering (Holdings) yesterday announced a sharp rise in 1993 pre-tax
profits from a restated Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 8.56m and is raising its
dividend for the year by 10 per cent to 9.5p, with a final of 3.02p.
The Shrewsbury-based metal stockholding, steel products and automotive
engineering group benefited from higher margins in its steel reinforcement
business, especially in the first half, the completion of its UK
rationalisation and another rise in profits from associated companies in the
Pacific Rim.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 have been restated for FRS 3, and would have been
Pounds 5.6m on a pre-FRS 3 and pre-exceptional cost basis.
Sales last year rose 8 per cent from Pounds 135.7m to Pounds 146m, and also
by 8 per cent, to Pounds 182m, if share of associates' sales is included.
Earnings per share rose to 19.18p, against 3.05p in 1992 when there was a
loss per share of 1.67p under the basic calculation including exceptional
items.
In metal stockholding, losses were cut by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 183,000,
while the steel reinforcement business turned a Pounds 1.5m loss into a
Pounds 62,000 profit.
Profits in the engineering division fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m, due
mainly to reduced profits and redundancy costs in Stadco's pressings
division. Profits in the automation division were slightly ahead.
Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said the takeover of Rover by BMW could help
Stadco win business for the first time from the German car group, and
Stadco's recently-announced joint venture with Honda Engineering would not
be affected.
On the outlook, Mr Hall said he would be very disappointed if the company
could not further improve profits slightly this year. In some businesses,
confidence is much higher than at the same time last year, although others
are still indirectly affected by the recession in continental Europe.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes Pounds 8.9m into the red -
Restructuring costs and heavy interest charges behind deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ransomes, the manufacturer of grass-cutting equipment, yesterday reported
sharply increased losses as it struggled with the twin burdens of
large-scale restructuring and heavy debt.
The two factors led to pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.9m in the 12 months to
December 31, compared with a restated 1992 deficit of Pounds 600,000.
Mr John Clement, chairman, blamed the decline on a restructuring programme
involving a 12 per cent cut in the workforce, the removal of a tier of
senior management and the contraction of its operating divisions.
The programme led to a threefold increase in exceptional charges to Pounds
5.8m.
Operating profits, meanwhile, fell by 35 per cent to Pounds 5.3m amid
intense competition in the US and flat sales in Europe.
The figures were dented further by interest charges of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds
8.7m) on net borrowings of Pounds 75.3m (Pounds 76.1m), representing gearing
of 450 per cent.
Despite the problems, Mr Clement, who took over as chairman last October,
said its principal bankers had agreed to maintain existing borrowing
facilities of Pounds 120m.
They have also backed moves to reshape the group by Mr Peter Wilson,
appointed chief executive last autumn.
Mr Wilson initiated the redundancy programme, closed some overseas
facilities and reorganised group operations in two new divisions -
commercial and consumer.
Profits in the commercial operation fell sharply to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds
7.11m) following the group's failure to exploit market opportunities -
particularly among golf course operators. Its poor performance was offset by
increased demand in the consumer division, which saw operating profits
increase 25 per cent to Pounds 3.52m.
Group turnover rose slightly to Pounds 165.8m (Pounds 156.6m).
Losses per share worked through at 26.1p against a restated 11.5p.
The company, which omitted its interim dividend, is also passing the final
on both its ordinary and cumulative preference shares.
COMMENT
Ransomes is paying the price for its dash for growth in 1989 when it
acquired Cushman, the US grass machinery group, for Dollars 150m (Pounds
103m). Although, the new management has begun to tackle the debt burden left
by that purchase, it faces an uphill struggle. The pressure has been
increased by its decision to change the year end to September, leaving only
10 months to produce some positive results. Nevertheless, it claims to have
already stripped out Dollars 10m of costs in the US and Pounds 1.5m at home.
Analysts, who were unwilling to make profit forecasts, warned the group
would have to make operating gains of more than Pounds 5.7m just to pay its
dividend liability and generate earnings per share.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lionheart back in black with Pounds 1.77m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lionheart, the Cheshire-based paint brushes and housewares group, returned
to profit in 1993 with Pounds 1.77m pre-tax, a Pounds 2.64m turnround on
1992's deficit of Pounds 870,000. Mr Paul Lever, chairman, said an
acquisition was now likely within months, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 43.6m), giving a
profit-to-sales ratio of 3.8 per cent. With earnings per share of 0.49p
(losses 0.59p) a final dividend of 0.2p is proposed making 0.3p (0.2p) for
the year.
The group returned to the dividend list only two years ago after
reconstruction under Mr Lever, the chairman and former chief executive of
Crown Paints.
Talks are understood to have begun about an acquisition with an announcement
in the first half of the current year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes share issue priced at 170p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wainhomes, the Chester-based housebuilder, yesterday announced details of
its plans to raise Pounds 30.5m from a flotation and offer for sale at 170p
a share.
The total amount to be raised is Pounds 41.9m including the sale of 5.8m
shares by existing institutional shareholders.
The issue will give the company a market value of about Pounds 106m. It
plans to place 16m shares mostly with institutions while offering a further
8.62m shares for sale to the public. After the sale it will have 62.24m
shares in issue.
Wainhomes is forecasting earnings of not less than 9.3p per share for the
year ending March 31, putting the group on a p/e of 18.3 times the issue
price.
It said that if it had been already quoted it would have recommended a total
dividend of 4.2p net, representing a notional gross dividend yield of 3.1
per cent.
The company is the latest in a growing list of UK housebuilders to issue
shares to finance land purchases to take advantage of the housing market
recovery. It is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.1m for the year to
the end of March, a 15 per cent gain on the previous year's Pounds 5.3m.
It expects to have sold about 950 homes by the end of March, which should
rise to between 1,200 and 1,500 next year, before increasing to 1,800. The
company will use the proceeds to repay borrowings - currently Pounds 17m -
and to buy land.
COMMENT
On the basis of earnings and yield the offer price of 170p is at a slight
premium to Beazer, a large proven housebuilder, which announced its
flotation terms last week. Wainhomes as a small provincial builder however,
has more to gain from increased volumes - and its margins stand comparison
with the better builders. Given market demand for the sector, both Beazer
and Wainhomes issues should succeed.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams in sixfold rise to Pounds
35.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent
Pre-tax profits of Heywood Williams Group, the building and automotive
components group, rose more than six times in 1993 from Pounds 5.5m to
Pounds 35.2m.
The company was assisted by significant gains following a series of
disposals and acquisitions. Operating profits, even after stripping out
these benefits, still rose by 86 per cent from Pounds 8.02m to Pounds
14.99m.
The Pounds 95m sale of the group's UK glass division to Pilkington added a
further Pounds 15m to these profits. Another Pounds 2.99m came from the
first six months earnings of LaSalle-Deitch, which supplies components and
furnishings for manufactured homes in the US.
Interest on Heywood's cash balances, currently about Pounds 10m, increased
pre-tax profits by another Pounds 500,000, compared with a debit of Pounds
3.02m.
Bridgewater, the UK automotive glass replacement business acquired last
autumn, and which is in the process of being re-organised, also contributed
a small profit.
Since the year end Heywood has completed the acquisition of Bristol
Products, the US plumbing components supplier, for Dollars 81.2m (Pounds
53.4m). The purchase was funded by a rights issue which raised Pounds 52.4m
at the end of last year.
The company, as forecast, is paying a final dividend of 8.5p (8p) making a
total for the year of 13p (12.5), the first dividend increase for two years.
Earnings per share were 36.2p (1.7p) or 32.9p (1.7p) diluted or 15.5p (1.7p)
before exceptional profit on the disposal to Pilkington. Turnover fell from
Pounds 389.5m to Pounds 365.6m.
The shares following the announcement rose 7p to 437p compared with a rights
issue price in December of 280p.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said: 'The sale of the under-performing UK
glass businesses, and the acquisitions we have made to secure and strengthen
key market positions in the more buoyant US manufactured housing and
recreational vehicles markets, has transformed our prospects.'
COMMENT
The tide is starting to turn in favour of Heywood Williams' main markets. US
housing and automotive businesses, accounting for almost half of group
turnover, are growing stronger as the economy recovers. Bad winter weather,
also, will have had less of an impact on manufactured homes than on general
housebuilding. In the UK, the homes market should continue to improve, while
increased investment in depots should offset any temporary softening of the
market following last year's introduction of windscreen checking in MoT
tests. Pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 40m this year. A quality
management and strong balance sheet makes the company worth an investment at
this level.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Crockfords gambling profits rise 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crockfords, the casino company that was reversed into TV-am last summer,
lifted profits from its gambling business by 16 per cent in 1993. Operating
profits from the continuing gambling side rose from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds
23m on gaming turnover up from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 51.3m.
At the pre-tax level profits for the year to end-December were Pounds 23.2m
against Pounds 38m in 1992, with the 1992 figure including Pounds 15.7m of
operating profits from TV-am, which stopped broadcasting on December 31
1992.
Crockfords opened London's first legal casino in Curzon Street in 1961. Last
August the company reversed into TV-am, which had lost its licence and was
planning a voluntary liquidation.
Mr Garry Nesbitt, chairman, said the group was firmly established at the
upper end of the London gaming market.
While the number of casinos in London was unchanged at 21, the total gaming
income was 34 per cent ahead at Pounds 304m. 'I believe that a significant
proportion of this increase may have been from the higher value players for
whom we cater,' Mr Nesbitt said.
Basic earnings per share were 16.18p (24.05p).
A final dividend of 2.5p is proposed for the first four months of the year,
equivalent to 7.5p for the full year.
Mr Nesbitt said the strategy was to develop the existing club, on which
Pounds 700,000 was spent last year, and to look out for other London
casinos. It would also be seeking acquisitions or start-up opportunities 'in
Europe and other overseas areas where gaming is well regulated'.
COMMENT
Profits at Crockfords depend on a small number of big hitters - the
prospectus said that over three years ten exceptional players had accounted
for 50 per cent. Clearly the company needs at least one more casino to
diversify its risks. But it is highly cash generative and ungeared, so
should be able to move quickly once an opportunity arises. Given the same
level of business this year earnings could reach more than 16.5p. A dividend
of 8p would represent a yield of more than 6.5 per cent - worth the gamble.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Everest shares fall 9p on warning about
static second half results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Everest Foods tumbled 9p to 68p yesterday after the West
Midlands-based egg and chip producer said it was unlikely to achieve full
year profits in accordance with market expectations.
Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, said the trend towards economy products had
resulted in severe pressure on margins.
This meant that pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.08m in
the six months to November 30, although turnover grew by nearly Pounds 3m to
Pounds 19m.
The company had taken steps to make manufacturing processes as cost
effective as possible. However, Mr Gilbert warned that if current trading
conditions persisted, full year profits were unlikely to improve
substantially on the interim figure.
Although earnings per share slipped from 3.15p to 2.9p, the interim dividend
has been held at 1.2p and a scrip dividend alternative proposed.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 60m tag on Robert Wiseman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor,
yesterday issued the pathfinder prospectus for the institutional placing
which should lead to it obtaining a stock market listing by the end of the
month.
The placing, by Panmure Gordon, should raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds
16m, leaving 75 per cent of the company in family hands. It is likely to
value the company at about Pounds 60m.
The terms of the placing will be announced on March 22.
Robert Wiseman concentrates on supplying branded milk in cartons to stores
in Scotland and is expanding in the north of England from a base in
Manchester.
In the 39 weeks to January 1 1994 turnover was Pounds 44.26m and pre-tax
profit was Pounds 4.25m.
About half the placing will finance a milk processing plant in Manchester
while the rest will be to complete the recent purchase of Mackie's dairy
near Aberdeen and future acquisitions.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Delta falls slightly to Pounds 53.4m -
Dividend increase reflects company's optimism on prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delta, the cables and engineering group, reported flat annual results
yesterday, but signalled guarded optimism about the economic outlook by
increasing its dividend for the first time since 1990.
Pre-tax profits dipped from Pounds 55.1m to Pounds 53.4m in the year to
January 1, mainly because of higher interest charges following its Pounds
37m purchase of the outstanding 36 per cent stake in Delta Crompton Cable
Holdings from BTR, the industrial conglomerate. Sales rose from Pounds 786m
to Pounds 833m.
Earnings per share increased marginally to 23.1p (23p). A final dividend of
10.3p lifts the total to 14.5p (14p).
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said Delta was one of the first UK
companies to freeze dividends as the downturn took hold, but now hoped it
had seen the bottom of the recession in continental Europe.
The upbeat tone was carefully qualified by Delta, which in September saw its
shares marked down sharply after it warned that the UK recovery in
manufacturing was more anaemic than many observers were suggesting.
Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman, said yesterday: 'Whilst current patterns of
demand remain patchy, early indications suggest a strengthening in some
sectors. Whilst we have seen transient effects before, there is now greater
evidence to suggest that the economic tide may be finally on the turn.'
Delta said it was another tough year, with continuing depressed and fiercely
competitive trading. European construction markets showed little recovery.
Mr Wilson said: 'Early signs of more encouraging activity in the UK soon
relapsed and demand then persisted at depressed levels. Prices remained
under pressure, particularly in cables.'
Delta shed 800 jobs last year, bringing the total employed down to 13,300.
The group has cut its workforce by a third since 1989. Mr Easton said he
would 'go on trimming - but the battle will moderate'.
The cables division suffered particularly from UK price wars, with operating
profits lower at Pounds 5.89m (Pounds 8.68m). Circuit protection dipped to
Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 17.1m) and engineering to Pounds 19.9 (Pounds 22.2m).
Industrial services however, rose to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 12.8m).
COMMENT
Actions speak louder than words, and Delta's willingness to let dividend
cover fall to 1.6 strikes a more positive note than the chairman's heavily
hedged statement on prospects. Analysts were struck by how tough things were
in the cable market, but still believe Delta's willingness to reduce its
cost base makes it heavily geared to any upturn. Action, rather than further
talk, on a possible US acquisition would also be appreciated. The shares,
down 7p to 522p, are on a prospective multiple of about 19. The 20 per cent
premium to the market reflects Delta's recovery stock status, but does not
look unjustified.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Improved production helps Aviva cut losses
to Dollars 2.63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aviva Petroleum, the small US-based oil and gas explorer, quoted in the UK,
yesterday announced sharply lower net losses of Dollars 2.63m (Pounds 1.8m),
against Dollars 10.23m last year, because of improved production from the
group's Colombian project.
The better result was achieved on virtually static oil and gas sales of
Dollars 10.68m, against Dollars 10.42m last time.
The loss per share was reduced from 124 cents to 11 cents. As in the past
there is no dividend.
Mr Ron Suttill, chief executive, said he was confident the group would be
able to achieve profits in spite of a depressed oil price.
Aviva was aiming to break even by the end of the current year, he said.
He stressed the potential of further development of the Colombian project,
jointly owned with Ecopetrol, the state energy company.
By 1995 Aviva hoped to earn some 24,000 barrels a day from its share of the
Colombian fields, which would result in a net cash flow contribution of
about Dollars 12m a year, Mr Suttill said.
Net production from Colombia increased by 54 per cent to 279,000 barrels
during the year. Mr Suttill said the increase, combined with a 10 per cent
rise in US gas prices, more than offset a decline in oil and gas volumes in
the US and reductions in the US and Colombian oil price. Currently all of
Aviva's Colombian production is sold to Ecopetrol.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Graseby surges ahead to Pounds 9.57m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graseby, the medical electronics, product monitoring, environmental and
defence technology group, yesterday reported sharply higher 1993 profits
reflecting growing international sales, lower interest costs and the absence
of exceptional charges.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December jumped to Pounds 9.57m from the
depressed Pounds 1.02m recorded in 1992, when they were reduced by Pounds
4.3m of net exceptional costs.
Earnings per share jumped to 11.4p (1.3p) and, in line with the board's
previously announced decision, the final dividend is being reduced to 3.3p
(7.6p) making a total for the year of 6.6p (10.9p). The shares closed down
5p at 181p.
Turnover increased by 10.8 per cent to Pounds 113.7m (Pounds 102.6m)
including Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 22.4m) from discontinued operations. Sales
from continuing operations grew by 22 per cent to Pounds 98.7m with exchange
rate movements accounting for just over a third of the increase.
International sales grew by 21 per cent, excluding exchange rate movements,
reflecting the group's reduced dependence on the domestic market.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 11m (Pounds 7.85m) including a Pounds
501,000 contribution from discontinued operations. In 1992 discontinued
operations reduced profits by Pounds 1.32m.
The advance was led by an exceptionally strong performance by the defence
business, where a number of large orders were completed resulting in the
technology division reporting profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 571,000) on
sales up 24 per cent to Pounds 34.3m.
In contrast, operating profits and trading margins slipped in the three
other divisions despite increased sales.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.52m) partly reflecting a
decline in year-end borrowings from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 15.9m,
representing gearing of 66 per cent - down from 99 per cent.
COMMENT
Graseby has completed its transformation from a group dependent on the
volatile defence and component sectors to an international instrument
supplier focused on four distinct value-added markets. The balance sheet is
now in much better shape and borrowings should fall further - even without
the deferred flotation of Graseby Anderson in the US. Although several of
its markets - including the UK medical market - face pricing pressures, the
overall trading margin should edge higher again this year towards the
group's 15 per cent target. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10m this year
should provide earnings of about 11.7p. The shares are trading on a
prospective p/e of 15.5 and look slightly undervalued.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rugby Estates net worth will triple after
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rugby Estates, the property investment company run by the former property
team at Hillsdown, the food group, is planning to raise Pounds 20m from a
flotation which will triple its net worth.
Rugby Estates was set up in 1990, 51 per cent owned by the management, led
by Mr David Tweeddale-Tye, chairman, and Mr Andrew Wilson, managing
director, and 49 per cent by Hillsdown. It started from scratch and had net
assets of Pounds 6.8m at the end of 1993, and a property portfolio now
valued at Pounds 29.2m.
The management is offering a three-year-old company which made pre-tax
profits of only Pounds 2m in 1993. But they boast a long and profitable
history with Hillsdown, which almost floated its property arm in 1987.
Mr Tye ran Hillsdown's property arm throughout the 1980s. He built up gross
assets of Pounds 100m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m at the market peak
of 1989, and succeeded in selling around two thirds of its portfolio before
the slump.
Rugby will raise Pounds 19.7m net of expenses from the share placement, of
which Pounds 4.7m will be used to repay a loan to Hillsdown and Pounds 2.6m
to buy a portfolio of properties from the food group. Gearing will fall to 5
per cent, providing scope for new investment.
Hillsdown is selling its entire shareholding, valued at about Pounds 4m,
through the placement. The management will own about 13 per cent of the
enlarged company.
Mr Tye said Rugby would continue to focus on retail properties, which
represent 80 per cent of the current portfolio. It is also likely to remain
an active property trader.
Rugby's speciality is buying secondary market properties where it can add
value through intensive management. The company's first investment, the
Brunswick Centre, has appreciated by 93 per cent since its purchase for
Pounds 2.85m in January 1991.
The full prospectus will be issued on March 30, and dealings are expected to
commence on April 8.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps lift Scholes 84%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scholes Group, the electrical installation equipment group, yesterday
announced an 84 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.3m to
Pounds 2.4m for the six months to December, despite a marginal increase in
UK sales.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 31.1m, but this was boosted by exports,
which increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 3.8m and now account for 12 per
cent of group sales.
Scholes' earnings growth was achieved primarily through further lowering of
the company's cost base, but also through some price increases in its major
business, manufacturing switchgear for the domestic housing market.
Operating profit margins increased from 5.5 per cent to 8.3 per cent at the
interim stage, and Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said he was confident further
operational streamlining could be achieved.
Mr Riches said: 'Management continues to focus on lowering the group's cost
structure and pursuing ways of enhancing manufacturing productivity.'
He said it would be tough for the company to achieve further price
increases, however, due to increasing competition from European
manufacturers prepared to buy market share at the expense of profit margins.
The company remains cash positive, and its net cash position increased by 37
per cent to Pounds 2.2m in December.
Scholes also announced that it had agreed to sell its 17 per cent stake in
Malaysian-listed PWE Industries.
The company will pay an interim dividend of 1.7p (1.6p). Earnings per share
increased from 2.4p to 4.3p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Seafield ahead to Pounds 1.62m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Seafield Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas
exploration company, rose from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 1.62m in the year to
end-December.
At the operating level profits were up from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds 1.5m.
Turnover grew by 39 per cent from Pounds 5.55m to Pounds 7.74m, the bulk of
which - Pounds 6.8m - was generated in the UK from the group's 5 per cent
interest in the Victor gas field.
As part of last year's overhaul of North Sea taxation rules, companies were
prevented from offsetting exploration and appraisal spending against income
from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax.
Although the terms were ultimately modified to include a limited form of
transitional relief, the outcome this time suffered from a surge in the tax
charge from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 967,000. This impacted on earnings,
which fell from 1.7p to 1.3p.
Operating cash flow was up 82 per cent at Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 2.66m).
Mr John Raitt, chairman, said that hydrocarbons had been encountered in all
five UK wells in which the company participated.
Two of these wells were significant discoveries, and one successfully
appraised an extension to the Victor field, confirming additional reserves.
The balance sheet remained strong with no debt, he added.
The company said it intended to apply for a full listing when the
simplified, low cost, procedure for USM companies had been finalised.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wimpey bounces back into black with Pounds
25.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey, following its biggest ever pre-tax loss of Pounds 111.6m in 1992,
bounced back into the black last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.5m.
Trading profits rose 85 per cent from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 40.9m, boosted
by a strong recovery in UK housing, with completed sales up by a quarter to
6,936.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.64bn to Pounds 1.59bn. The final dividend
is again 3.25p, maintaining the total for the year at 5.25p, just covered by
earnings of 6.81p a share.
Housing, in spite of only breaking even overseas, moved from a Pounds 33.3m
loss in 1992 to a Pounds 25.4m profit last year. Operating margins in the
UK, having fallen in every year since 1989, more than doubled from 3 per
cent to 6.5 per cent last year. This compared with a peak of 19 per cent
four years ago.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, was optimistic about further rises in UK
house sales and margins, with prices already starting to edge off the bottom
in south-east England.
He said the company had seen no evidence that tax rises due to take effect
next month were dampening demand from prospective purchasers.
Wimpey would be selling its house building businesses in France, Spain,
Australia and southern California to concentrate on its UK and other US
housing operations. Also still up for sale was Pounds 135m of commercial
property investments.
The group has raised more than Pounds 300m from disposals, transforming its
balance sheet and reducing gearing from 30 per cent to 5 per cent, the
lowest level for 20 years.
Net debt of Pounds 28m at end-December, however, is expected to rise this
year as the group increases land purchases, while UK house sales are
expected to top 7,500 during the period. Gearing was likely to reach 30 per
cent, implying net debt of about Pounds 160m.
Construction profits halved from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 2.2m on turnover down
from Pounds 683m to Pounds 659m, reflecting the difficult conditions in the
UK. The figures however excluded Pounds 8m of interest on advanced payments
on construction projects.
Minerals, helped by a Pounds 7.9m windfall planning gain, rose to Pounds
13.1m (Pounds 1.6m).
COMMENT
Wimpey's results were bang in line with expectations. Even so its share
price fell 8p to 210p following the figures. The market having given the
company credit for rebuilding its balance sheet is concerned about where it
goes next. There is concern that its emphasis on first time buyers will mean
that margin recovery may be restricted. The UK aggregates business also
compares unfavourably with its main rival, Tarmac. The company talks bravely
of acquisitions and organic expansion, but now needs to deliver. Profits of
Pounds 45m put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 20. The shares,
after a good run, are now suffering.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Visa EMEA spending rises 13% to Dollars
183bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of spending using Visa cards within the Europe, Middle East and
Africa region (EMEA) totalled Dollars 183bn (Pounds 125.3bn) in 1993, some
13 per cent higher than in 1992.
The number of Visa EMEA card transactions rose by almost 5 per cent to
2.36bn, while the number of Visa cards in existence rose by more than 5 per
cent to 70.8m.
Mr Jean-Jacques Desbons, president and chief executive of Visa EMEA, said
the organisation was confident that growth 'will continue throughout the
next year and will increase further as the world economy starts picking up.'
Both the increases in card-holder spending in terms of US dollars and in the
number of cards in 1993 against the previous year are lower in percentage
terms than annual increases since 1989.
Mr Desbons also said Visa planned to introduce its Electron card into the UK
before the end of the year. It is already available elsewhere and can be
used only through electronic means. Because each transaction would be
authorised individually by the banks, the card would offer greater security,
and so banks might be prepared to make it available to more of their
customer base than existing cards.
Visa EMEA represents about 36 per cent of Visa International's worldwide
sales volume.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Paterson Zochonis rises 15%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paterson Zochonis, the detergents manufacturer, was bullish yesterday about
prospects as it announced a 15 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits
to Pounds 13.6m.
The increase was achieved on sales 3 per cent ahead to Pounds 126m for the
six months to November 30.
The company said it was confident that, barring any unexpected currency
movements, it would increase profits from last time's Pounds 25.3m in the
year to May 31. The interim dividend was increased by 4 per cent to 2.45p.
Earnings were 18 per cent higher at 17.69p.
During the first half, profits were helped by lower interest charges, an
increased contribution from associates and an improved operating return.
Interest charges fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 2.74m, while the contribution
from associates rose by Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.83m.
The company said trading in parts of Africa was becoming increasingly
difficult, particularly in Nigeria, the Congo and Cameroun.
In Europe, Paterson increased sales of Cussons soaps and toiletries in a
competitive market. The Polish detergents manufacturer returned an
encouraging performance, the company said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders bid to oust Andrews Sykes board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel shareholders at Andrews Sykes, the lossmaking industrial services
group, yesterday launched a bid to oust the board in a re-run of a similar
coup attempt 18 months ago.
Dissidents led by Mr Jacques Murray, who holds 29.2 per cent of the Midlands
company, have called an extraordinary meeting at which they hope to win
management control.
A spokesman for Mr Murray, chairman of Nu-Swift, the fire protection group,
said the move reflected dissatisfaction with Sykes' performance.
Last December, the group reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.34m
(Pounds 802,000 profit).
'We want to support the company and bring about an improvement,' Mr Murray's
spokesman added.
Mr David Hubbard, group chairman, said the board would fight the rebel
action and would seek the support of institutional shareholders.
Opposition by institutional investors defeated Mr Murray 18 months ago after
the last battle for control. Andrews Sykes has now offered Mr Murray board
representation, but not majority control. His spokesman said the offer had
not been rejected, but described the extraordinary meeting as a parallel
tactic.
Andrews Sykes shares closed up 5p at 90p.

GKN yesterday announced it had received acceptances in respect of almost 50m
units of non-interest bearing convertible loan stock, representing about
90.9 per cent of the units offered in its recent rights issue.
The units are priced at 480p apiece and are payable in two equal
instalments.
Subscribers have been procured at a premium for the 4.83m units for which
valid acceptances were not received.
The second instalment of 240p per stock unit remains conditional on the
offers for Westland becoming wholly unconditional and GKN achieving 75 per

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rights bolsters Wassall advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wassall, the conglomerate which lost the bid battle for Evode last year, saw
pre-tax profits jump from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 27.6m in 1993 on sales up
11 per cent to Pounds 277.8m.
Profits were boosted by the Pounds 103m rights issue launched to fund the
thwarted Evode bid. But the issue diluted earnings per share which rose 23
per cent to 11.7p.
Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said that earnings per share would have
been 11 per cent higher but for the rights issue, though they were lifted 8
per cent by exchange rate movements.
The loss of Evode, where Wassall was outbid by Laporte, has been followed by
further disappointments, including abortive talks with Fenner. 'We have got
quite close to a number of things but most failed for price-related
reasons,' said Mr Miller.
'We are as confident as you can be that there will be an acceptable deal in
the not too distant future,' he added.
Although Wassall is still viewed as an acquisition-driven group, Mr Miller
pointed to the strong organic growth shown by the 32 per cent increase in
operating profit to Pounds 27.2m. 'That suggests there is something we are
doing that is not straight asset-stripping.'
He said the improvement was 'particularly satisfactory' given that most of
its markets outside the US experienced little or no recovery last year.
Even in the US, its DIY products supplier DAP has had to work hard to
increase sales and most of the advance came from higher margins. Its
operating profits rose from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 13.7m, on sales Pounds
20.7m higher at Pounds 146.7m.
Metal Closures, the bottle top manufacturer which was the group's first
large acquisition, continued to make good progress. The South African arm,
which contributes nearly 30 per cent of group profits, had an 'excellent'
year in difficult conditions and the division's profits rose to Pounds 12.2m
(Pounds 9.3m) on sales of Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 76.6m).
A final dividend of 2.4p gives a total up 36 per cent at 3.4p (2.5p).
COMMENT
It may be that the ex-Hanson men who run Wassall are just too choosy when it
comes to buying companies. But then they can afford to be. Their past
acquisitions are still generating the sort of improvements that most
'growth' companies would kill for. Perhaps most remarkable of all is the
progress of Metal Closures' South African business, where profits have risen
from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 8m since Wassall bought the company in 1990. This
exposure may unsettle the nervous, though Mr Miller points out things would
have to get pretty bad to hit sales of bottle tops. The real worry is
Wassall's inability to find an earnings enhancing acquisition despite the
low returns on its cash pile. Without some action before long, the shares'
deservedly high rating will be hard to sustain. On current year forecasts of
about Pounds 31.5m the shares at 295p, up 10p, are on a multiple of over 22.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook's shares rise on container sale
completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tiphook rose by 5p to 55p yesterday after the debt-laden transport
leasing group confirmed the completion of the sale of its container business
to Transamerica, the US financial services group, writes Andrew Bolger.
Proceeds of Pounds 673m were received yesterday by Tiphook, which could
receive a further Pounds 49m from the deal.
The final consideration depends on changes in the net assets of the
container operations between September 30 and yesterday, and is subject to a
completion audit.
Tiphook, which had debts of more than Pounds 1bn, had warned that its
survival depended on the successful disposal.
Completion of the sale was conditional on consents by a majority of the
group's US bondholders.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Shift in focus leaves Williams down at
Pounds 153m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced improved
cashflow and a 13 per cent increase in profits before exceptional items to
Pounds 170.3m for the year to December 31.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 17.1m, to cover the loss on disposal of the
bulk of Williams' engineering division to management for Pounds 40m in
December, depressed pre-tax profits by Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 153.2m. The
sale is part of the group's strategy to focus on three sectors - building
products, security and fire protection.
Cashflow from operating activities, for which Williams has been criticised
in the past, improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 227.9m. This represented 119
per cent of operating profits.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chief executive, was bullish about the outlook for the
group's main operating markets, saying there were definite signs of recovery
in the UK and US. Some 80 per cent of the group's sales are from those two
markets. In the UK however, 'government policy and consumer caution will
limit the pace and degree of demand improvement,' he said.
Williams was seeking growth in spite of such difficulties, Mr Rudd said,
through expanding its share of even sluggish markets by tapping new outlets.
The group's sales were 17 per cent higher at Pounds 1.21bn, including a
Pounds 66.9m contribution from acquisitions. Continuing businesses were 11
per cent up at Pounds 1.1bn.
Williams pursued acquisitions aggressively during the year, spending Pounds
157.6m on seven businesses. These contributed Pounds 6.3m to operating
profits, which improved overall by 13 per cent to Pounds 191.6m.
North American building products showed the strongest advance, as a result
of a cost reductions. Operating profits rose 34 per cent to Pounds 39.6m.
Fire protection improved by 19 per cent to Pounds 47.6m, while the European
building products operations contributed Pounds 69.1m against Pounds 59.3m.
The security division improved from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 25.2m.
In line with its stated policy of seeking to improve the dividend cover to
about two times, Williams proposed a final payment of 7.75p. This leaves the
total dividend just 2 per cent higher at 12.75p. Earnings fell from 18.6p to
15.7p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Owen  Robinson price rises on reports of
stake acquisition move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Owen  Robinson, the gold jewellery and sports footwear retailer,
rose 8p to 34p yesterday after a report that a stake in the group might be
taken by Mr Philip Green, the controversial former chairman and chief
executive of Amber Day, the discount retailer.
Mr Green said last night: 'At this moment, I have bought no shares.' It is
understood, however, that Mr Green has had talks with Mr Maurice Dwek, a
former chairman of Owen  Robinson, who still owns 15.8 per cent of its
shares.
Mr Green declined to comment on any possible talks, but said: 'I always look
at interesting situations. If it's the right deal at the right time, I might
look at it.'
Mr Steve Foot, Owen  Robinson's finance director, said of Mr Green: 'If
he's buying shares, he hasn't done so yet.'
Mr Green stepped down in September, 1992, from Amber Day, which has since
been renamed the WEW Group. He left with a Pounds 1.13m golden handshake
after a deluge of adverse press coverage was followed by results well below
analysts' expectations. Mr Green also received Pounds 7.6m from selling his
stake in the group.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Medeva chief goes as rise of 28% to Pounds
46m is shown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, the entrepreneur who founded Medeva, the acquisitive
pharmaceuticals group, is resigning his executive position nine months after
a profit warning which halved the share price.
Mr Gowrie-Smith, managing director, and his long-time business partner Mr
David Lees, who is resigning as finance director to be succeeded by Mr
Dennis Millard, will continue to provide the group with 'acquisition
services' on a consultancy basis. Mr Gowrie-Smith will remain a
non-executive director.
The resignations came as Medeva announced a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 46.1m for 1993.
In July it warned that profits would be about Pounds 10m lower than
analysts' expectations of Pounds 53m-Pounds 57m largely due to problems at
two US subsidiaries.
Sales rose 39 per cent to Pounds 200.4m on the back of organic growth but
excluding exchange rate movements of 20 per cent. Earnings fell 4 per cent
to 11.8p due partly to a higher tax charge. The final dividend is 1.8p
(1.5p) for a 2.7p (2.25p) total.
Mr Bernard Taylor, brought in as chairman in 1990, insisted that the
resignations were not linked to the problems the group encountered last
year. He denied there had been any pressure on the two to go.
Although it is an open secret that Mr Taylor found it hard to work with Mr
Gowrie-Smith, sources close to the company also insisted that the
resignations were voluntary.
Mr Gowrie-Smith said that he had approached Mr Taylor in April or May,
before the problems arose, asking to end his managerial role.
Both Mr Gowrie-Smith and Mr Lees will receive Pounds 30,000 in compensation
for loss of office and have been granted three-year consultancy agreements.
These provide for initial payments of Pounds 286,000 and Pounds 230,000 and
payments over the next three years totalling a minimum of Pounds 700,000 and
Pounds 400,000 respectively. Mr Gowrie-Smith received a salary of about
Pounds 310,000 last year, down about 25 per cent.
Mr Taylor revealed that the group pulled out of a potential deal after the
shares slumped from 216p to 116p on the profit warning but said it still
needed to make acquisitions. Mr Gowrie-Smith said it could afford to make a
Pounds 100m purchase without issuing more shares.
The shares added 7p to 155p yesterday.
COMMENT
The rather modest rise in Medeva's share price yesterday may reflect the
fact that Mr Gowrie-Smith's move was seen as only a matter of time. There
were also a few negatives with the figures, which were boosted by booming
flu vaccine sales, including a year delay in the important hepatitis B
vaccine programme. On forecasts for the current year of about Pounds 54m the
shares are now on a multiple of about 12.5. There is plenty of scope for
further recovery.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Of relationships and bottom lines - The
personal conflicts at the top of Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charlie Scott, group chief executive of Saatchi  Saatchi, yesterday
described the past 18 months as the worst in his life. However, he considers
his struggle to reduce debts, restructure operations and install effective
management is now largely over.
As his statement accompanying the group's results yesterday said: 'All the
businesses remaining in the group are now profitable, and as trading
conditions in our core markets start to improve during 1994, I am confident
Saatchi will demonstrate the performance that our shareholders have the
right to expect.'
Whether or not his confidence is justified will depend, to a large extent,
on two factors. First, the Saatchi board will need to tackle the
embarrassing leaks about tension between Mr Maurice Saatchi, its chairman,
and Mr Scott.
Second, the revamped management, particularly in the US, will need to start
showing new business gains and evidence that it can reverse the decline in
market share which has been eroding revenues.
The relationship between Mr Scott and Mr Saatchi appeared to decline sharply
from the point when, in December, it was announced that Maurice's brother,
Charles, would step down as a director.
It was also decided that Saatchi's offices in Berkeley Square, in the West
End of London, would be vacated.
There followed rumours that the brothers were planning a buy-out and that
Maurice wanted to take over more of the running of the group. Now, a
compensation committee, headed by Sir Peter Walters, will examine Maurice's
five-year rolling contract, described by Mr Scott as 'not within the spirit
of the Cadbury guidelines'.
Says one Maurice supporter: 'He admits he has withdrawn a lot over the past
year, he had let things drift. He's left executive functions with the board
and he now believes that was a mistake.'
Maurice is said to feel that the 'beancounters' have failed to deliver their
promises on the financial side. Mr Scott will not be drawn on the subject,
but his supporters say that Maurice has yet to deliver on his part of the
bargain - bringing in new clients.
To blame Mr Scott for what continues to be a depressing picture is unjust,
according to the heads of other agencies.
Said the chief executive of one large group yesterday: 'One has to remember
it was Maurice Saatchi who talked of bidding for the Midland Bank. He was
also one of the architects of the huge, sprawling, shambling empire. To
begin to blame Charlie Scott, who seems to have done a fair job of
stabilising the business, seems to me to be desperately unfair. Indeed,
there wouldn't be a business without Charlie Scott.'
The head of another large agency pointed to the 'nervousness and confusion'
resulting from the conflict, which is being felt by staff at the Saatchi 
Saatchi agency network, which shares the holding company's name. There is
concern that some of the bad press will have an effect on relationships with
clients.
And it is the relationship with clients - particularly potential clients -
that will have most influence on the bottom line. According to Mr Scott, the
group has lost about 1.4 percentage points of market share over the past
three years - worth about Pounds 50m a year in revenue - from the 20 per
cent of the global market it holds.
The problem is largely in the US, where big contracts to have been lost
recently include the Chrysler and Helene Curtis accounts, worth Pounds 30m
in revenue this year.
Fixed costs are high. The staff of about 11,000 account for more than 60 per
cent of revenue. By growing revenue, Mr Scott is aiming to get this down to
the 55 per cent or so enjoyed by competitors Interpublic and Omnicom - he
calculates that at least half of any extra revenue will flow straight to the
bottom line.
Mr Scott calculates that over the past four years, and in particular over
the past two, about 70 per cent of the managers he describes as the 'key
drivers' towards these ends have been replaced or transferred.
'For the first time since I joined the company, we now have quality CEOs in
all our operating companies. These people have been selected for their
ability to grow the business,' he said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring aids Emess recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emess, the UK's largest lighting company, yesterday announced the reversal
of two years of losses with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m for 1993, against a
Pounds 10.6m deficit in 1992.
The result was mainly attributable to improved performances from the US and
German subsidiaries, and the impact of an aggressive restructuring
programme.
During 1993, group staffing levels were reduced by 20 per cent to 2,000, as
businesses were streamlined and unprofitable product lines cut. Sales per
employee rose from Pounds 54,000 to Pounds 64,000 in the year.
Turnover was Pounds 131.2m, against Pounds 130.3m from continuing operations
in 1992.
Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, said: 'I am more encouraged by prospects for our
businesses in 1994 than at any time during the past four years'. He added
that trading in the first two months was ahead of budget.'
Operating profit was Pounds 6m (Pounds 1m loss). The UK operations
contributed Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 0.1m) and they have seen a strong start to
the current year.
Brilliant, the German business, had lost Pounds 2m in 1992, but contributed
a marginal profit last year, after staff reorganisation. Also its US
subsidiary returned to the black during 1993. Net debt at the year-end was
up from Pounds 20m to Pounds 26m, because of the repurchase of Pounds 11m of
preference shares. However, average debt for the year was lower, and
interest payments fell from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 2m.
The company has recommended an unchanged final dividend of 0.1p, despite the
fact that net earnings of Pounds 2.4m were not sufficient to cover
preference dividends of Pounds 3.9m.
Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to 1.5p (7.2p losses). The shares
closed 2 1/2 p higher yesterday at 32p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Flotation values Maid at Pounds 89.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Maid, the on-line business information supplier, were priced at
110p yesterday valuing the group at Pounds 89.1m - well below market
expectations fuelled by the company and its financial advisers.
Some 11.5m shares in the nine-year-old group have been placed firm with
institutional investors by Hoare Govett, stockbroker to the issue, on behalf
of the company.
The new shares represent a little more than 14 per cent of the shares in
issue following the placing.
Earlier the company had been confidently predicting that the issue,
underwritten by Hill Samuel, would place a minimum value of Pounds 100m on
the group and provide it with about Pounds 16m in net new funds. A placing
price of up to 150p a share had been mooted.
However the flotation has been dogged with controversy, with some analysts
and fund managers expressing concern and surprise at Maid's proposed stock
market valuation and lack of established track record.
As a result the company scaled down its expectations for the flotation price
and has abandoned plans to spend Pounds 4m on a building to consolidate the
group's UK operations.
In addition, a number of existing BES investors in the company who had been
expected to sell shares in the placing, have decided to wait.
Nevertheless, both the company and its advisers insisted that the placing
had been a success and defended the pricing while blaming competitors for
'the background noise' surrounding the issue.
Mr Stephen Aulsebrook of Hill Samuel, described the 110p price as 'very
attractive', and said the placing had been well received by most
institutional investors.
'We set out to raise enough money for the company to move forward and we
have done that,' he said, adding, 'it is a hell of an achievement for a
company which, as some people have pointed out, made only Pounds 600,000 in
profits last year.'
Mr Daniel Wagner, Maid's 30-year-old founder and chief executive, said he
was 'thrilled to bits' with the placing while acknowledging that market
conditions had resulted in the issue having to be priced 'more
competitively'.
He said the new funds, while somewhat less than anticipated, would enable
Maid to continue to develop its product portfolio, including a planned
version of Maid for Windows version of it's software.
He dismissed the company's critics who have questioned various aspects of
its operations, including its dependence on primary business information
providers.
'This is a brilliant business and we are going to prove it in the market,'
Mr Wagner said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BJ puts pressure on bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brown  Jackson, the discount retailer which has raised Pounds 39m from
shareholders since 1992, yesterday sought to put pressure on its bankers by
warning it could not continue trading unless working capital facilities of
Pounds 14m were agreed soon.
The company's shares fell by 3 3/4 to 2 3/4 p as it revealed substantially
larger than expected losses for 1993 and warned of the difficulties in
negotiations with its bankers.
If working capital facilities for the next 12 months are not secured soon,
the Pounds 6m sale and leaseback transaction which was due to be completed
yesterday cannot go ahead.
Analysts held out little hope of a resolution, at least through the banks,
and said that the group had been expected to make further losses this year.
'BJ has just passed its cash peak,' said Mr William Cullum, analyst with
brokers Panmure Gordon. 'so the banks will get out what they put in.'
The announcement was also a high risk gamble, he suggested. 'If you were a
supplier would you now want to supply BJ? This sort of public disagreement
could be self-fulfilling,' Mr Cullum said.
Mr Ian Gray, the chief executive appointed following a rescue rights issue
in 1992, said the group had 'adequate trading facilities today'. He was
confident that the company would be able to trade until a solution was
found. 'We have a number of options,' he said.
One of the options was investment by a foreign discount retailer, he said.
The group was in discussions with both the retailer and the banks.
Midland Bank is believed to have decided not to provide further facilities
in light of the group's most recent results and its past trading record.
Brown  Jackson unveiled full year losses of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 6.6m) on
turnover of Pounds 170m (Pounds 167m), against average expectations of an
Pounds 8m deficit.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi back to black with Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi  Saatchi, one of the world's largest advertising groups, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.2m for the year ended December 31
1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 595.1m in 1992, writes Diane Summers.
The figure was in line with City expectations, which were revised downwards
by about Pounds 6m in December, after a profits warning from the group. The
shares closed down 1p at 141p.
Saatchi hailed the results as a return to profitability for the first time
since 1988. However, the 1992 figure included a Pounds 600m write-off of
goodwill associated with US acquisitions made in the 1980s.
Revenue from continuing operations rose 10 per cent, from Pounds 731m to
Pounds 806m, but the rise was accounted for by currency movements, said
Saatchi. Excluding these, revenue for 1993 was flat.
Similarly, operating costs appeared to rise from Pounds 713.8m to Pounds
776.6m. But once constant exchange rates were applied and severance,
property credits and disposals excluded, costs dropped by 1 per cent.
The group warned that revenues in 1994 will be lower than for 1993. 'The
revenue outlook for 1994 is difficult. We have lost two big clients, in
neither case due to the quality of our work, and clients remain cautious
about their planned level of expenditure, particularly in Europe.'
Trading profits increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 34.2m).
Severance costs of Pounds 19.1m were charged and Pounds 7.3m surplus
property provisions were credited. Excluding currency movements and
exceptionals trading profits increased by 1 per cent.
Profit margins, excluding exceptional items, increased from 6.1 per cent to
6.3 per cent in 1993. Mr Charlie Scott, group chief executive, admitted that
the group was not on course to meet his target of 10 per cent margins by
1995. Meeting the target was dependent on revenues increasing in line with
inflation, and that had not happened during 1993, he said.
Profit attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 7.3m (loss of Pounds
613.7m), with earnings per share of 3.7p (losses of 362.8p). No dividend
will be paid.
After taking into account a Pounds 73m rights issue in June and currency
movements, average net debt during December 1993 was Pounds 112m, a
reduction of Pounds 82m. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds
30m for 1994, with earnings per share of 7p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Wolseley shares soar on 83% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wolseley, the world's biggest supplier of heating and plumbing
equipment, soared by 69p to 971p yesterday as the group again surprised the
City with a sharp rise in profits. Pre-tax profits for the six months to
January 31 rose 83 per cent from Pounds 47.6m to Pounds 87m. Analysts had
expected Pounds 70m.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, attributed the rise to
increased activity in building distribution in the UK and US, coupled with
the contributions from acquisitions. He said the company continued to apply
best practice, adding: 'If you have a formula that seems to work, then it
seems advisable to press on.'
Turnover rose from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 1.54bn, including Pounds 92.5m
from acquisitions.
The contribution from Erb Lumber, a US distributor of lumber and associated
products bought for Pounds 51.1m last August, had exceeded expectations. Erb
accounted for most of the Pounds 4.67m contribution by acquisitions to total
US building distribution trading profit of Pounds 34.8m, up from Pounds
18.3m. US profits included a Pounds 4.3m currency gain.
Turnover from continuing US operations advanced from Pounds 542.4m to Pounds
710.6m. Sales at Familian in California were static, but its trading loss
was 'close to being eliminated'.
But Wolseley warned that as the US house building recovery had started by
July last year, it was 'most unlikely' that the rate of growth would be
maintained in the second half.
Turnover for building distribution in Europe rose from Pounds 482.2m to
Pounds 549.4m. Trading profits increased from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 35m.
The group said UK sales were 12 per cent ahead while Brossette, the French
arm, had raised sales by 7 per cent.
European manufacturing and other activities raised turnover from Pounds
120.4m to Pounds 190.5m. The division's trading profits jumped from Pounds
51.8m to Pounds 88.7m, including a contribution of Pounds 7.5m from
Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer acquired last April.
At the end of the half, the group had a 'small positive cash balance',
mainly from the Pounds 55m raised by last August's share placing. Earnings
per share were 72 per cent ahead at 22.09p (12.86p), and the interim
dividend was raised from 3.55p to 4.72p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Break-up threat to pension fund fantasy league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the annual results season for the UK's occupational pension schemes.
Trustees are poring over sheets of opaque investment numbers, the two main
measuring agencies are about to publish their aggregated returns and fund
managers are preparing variously to boast or to make excuses.
But as the annual league table exercise nears its climax, there is a strong
feeling that the game is changing. Britain's unique focus on a shrinking
universe of so-called balanced managers who are engaged in the tweaking of
near-consensus strategies may be shifting.
As pension plans become ever more mature - that is, they move towards a
position where they will pay out more in benefits than they receive in
contributions - their risk tolerance grows smaller and their need to match
their assets in a customised way to their individual liabilities becomes
greater.
Yet if the old order is going out, it is retreating in some style. According
to provisional figures from one of the measurers, Caps, the median fund
returned 29 per cent last year, a result only beaten once (in 1989) in the
past decade. The five-year average annual rate of return for the median fund
now works out at 16.7 per cent, a long way above assumed actuarial returns
which are based on a small margin over growth in average employee earnings.
Certain managers achieved exceptional returns last year, such as Schroders
with almost 33 per cent. Morgan Grenfell did well too, and among the smaller
contenders Newton hit 35 per cent. The market leader Mercury Asset
Management keeps its figures to itself - there is a wide dispersion among
its hundreds of client funds - but Gartmore and Phillips  Drew Fund
Management both had unexciting years: Gartmore was pulled just above the
median at the end of the year by Hong Kong but PDFM stayed just below after
its bearish dash for cash proved ill-timed in the final quarter (though it
will have enjoyed this year so far).
But with equity and bond markets booming worldwide the value added by the
average manager does not appear to have been substantial. No great strategic
initiatives appear to have been taken in 1993. According to Caps, exposure
to UK equities drifted by 2 percentage points to 58 per cent of the average
portfolio, while overseas equities expanded by 1.5 points to 24.5 per cent.
Overseas bonds at 6 per cent scarcely budged, nor did UK fixed interest
bonds at 3.5 per cent (the government's Pounds 50bn gilt-edged selling
programme passed pension funds by).
The biggest current bets appear to be in international equity allocations,
where the US and Japan together accounted for only 30 per cent of overseas
equities at the end of 1993 although they represented 65 per cent of the
world ex-UK capitalisation. Many managers, however, have recently been going
back into Japan and moderating the extreme exposure to continental Europe
and the Pacific Rim (ex-Japan). The latter two regions accounted for 65 per
cent of pension fund overseas equity holdings, but for only 24 per cent of
the world ex-UK market.
Despite these tilted weightings, the present allocations of UK pension funds
can be almost wholly explained by the passive cumulative impact of past
returns. Instead of targeting an asset allocation and then periodically
rebalancing (by selling assets that have outperformed and buying others that
have underperformed) the managers have let their winners run. That may sound
reasonable but it ignores the accumulation of risk.
Now the balanced managers have reached an 82 per cent exposure to equities.
Some pension plans such as that of British Rail are beginning to buckle
under the strain and set up dedicated bond portfolios which are better
matched to their ever-shortening liability structure.
More generally, the fully-discretionary mandate is being phased out in
favour of benchmarks, usually set in terms of a combination of indices (or
for a specialist mandate, only one). This process is rapidly turning the
general performance table into a kind of fantasy league, which will have to
be replaced by many different specialist league tables.
It will be a whole lot more rational but a whole lot less fun.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Mirror Group jumps back with Pounds 132m: Recovery of money
for plundered pension funds - Dividend to be resumed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday celebrated its independence from
administrators and the legacy of the late Robert Maxwell by announcing
higher than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 131.9m.
The turnround from a loss of Pounds 88.7m in 1992 included net exceptional
gains of Pounds 58.1m, compared with charges of Pounds 121.2m. The group was
able to release provisions of Pounds 60.8m as more money was recovered for
plundered pension funds.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman, said 1993 had been 'a year of success and
transformation for Mirror Group Newspapers. Every aspect of the business has
come under scrutiny.'
Trading profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 115.9m on turnover up 2 per cent
at Pounds 476.1m for the 53 weeks to January 2. Profits before tax and
exceptionals reached Pounds 73.8m, against Pounds 32.5m.
'We have more than doubled the profits at the same time as we have gained
our independence,' said Mr David Montgomery, chief executive. This week has
also seen MGN move its titles to new headquarters in Canary Wharf in
London's Docklands.
Later this week, possibly today, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, is expected to rule on the bid by a consortium which includes MGN
for Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and Independent on
Sunday.
MGN said it planned to resume dividend payments this year. Earnings per
share, excluding exceptionals, rose from 5.8p to 15.1p.
Year-end net debt fell from Pounds 392m to Pounds 335m and the company said
it intended to renegotiate borrowing terms with its banks.
Savings included Pounds 16m in production and editorial, partly offset by
Pounds 7m in extra newsprint and promotional costs. Some 600 jobs were cut
last year, bringing the workforce down to 2,900. Another 200 jobs are still
to go.
Despite pressure on circulation, particularly on the Daily Mirror which
faces tough competition from the cut-price Sun, circulation revenue fell
only marginally from Pounds 301.9m to Pounds 298.8m and advertising revenue
rose from Pounds 154.2m to Pounds 169.1m.
Mr Montgomery estimated the cover price cuts at The Sun and The Times were
costing News International Pounds 1m a week.
Circulations of the three main MGN titles - the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror
and People - are all declining but they are holding on to market share.
Between September 1993 and February 1994, according to ABC figures, The
People lost 3.35 per cent to 1.99m. But three years ago the rate of decline
was 15 per cent. In the six months to February, the Sunday Mirror lost 3.79
per cent to 2.57m, while the Daily Mirror dropped 7.3 per cent to 2.52m.
MGN shares rose 7p to close at 197p yesterday.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Emotional onslaught against Rover sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover group, the last British-owned volume car producer, will officially
pass into the ownership of BMW, the German carmaker, on Friday, but only
after bitter opposition was expressed yesterday by small shareholders in
British Aerospace.
The takeover, which will create the world's largest specialist carmaker,
cleared the two final hurdles yesterday, when it was approved by both the
European Commission and BAe shareholders.
Shareholders attending BAe's extraordinary general meeting voted 111 to 42
yesterday on a show of hands to reject the deal, but it was passed
overwhelmingly by proxy votes of 119.6m to 2.9m in favour of the BAe board.
BMW is paying Pounds 800m cash and taking over Pounds 200m of net debt and
Pounds 700m of off-balance sheet funding to purchase an 80 per cent stake in
Rover.
The BAe board has faced the unremitting hostility of small shareholders to
the sale. Outside the meeting a handful of demonstrators with one
23-year-old Land Rover turned up to protest, armed with a couple of union
flags and two placards declaring 'Sale of Rover Industrial Dunkirk' and
'European Union means death for British industry'.
Inside the meeting the atmosphere was much tougher, and Mr John Cahill, the
departing BAe chairman, floundered as he was bombarded with fierce criticism
and emotional outbursts. Not one shareholder rose to support the sale of
Rover.
The BAe board was accused of 'selling the family silver' and of damaging
Britain's relations with Japan. The sale of Rover to Germany was called
'offensive' and 'objectionable'.
The integrity of the board was attacked, it was accused of telling 'half
truths and untruths', of selling the wrong business, and of failing to win
written guarantees for keeping Rover jobs and Rover's technology base in the
UK.
There was loud ironic applause when Mr Cahill was told, 'you are on your way
back home to the US with a Pounds 3.5m bonus', and the BAe chairman
struggled to control the meeting.
Why did BAe have to increase its borrowing limits when it was receiving
Pounds 800m in cash, wondered one shareholder. 'If I sell half the family
silver, I reduce my indebtedness, not increase it.'
But after two hours of rancour, the BAe proxy votes ensured that by the end
of the week Britain will no longer own a volume carmaker.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Regulators move on OTC derivatives risk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
British and American securities regulators yesterday announced a joint
effort aimed at limiting risks to the international financial system posed
by the explosive growth of over-the-counter derivative instruments.
These instruments are not traded on exchanges, have no official market
price, and are tailor-made to suit the needs of individual counterparties.
Regulators are concerned that securities firms have controls to help them
account for and understand risks they take and to ensure adequate capital is
set aside.
The agreement is between the UK Securities and Investments Board, and two US
bodies, the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodities and Futures
Trading Commission.
'Everyone feels there is no sense in trying to regulate this product,' said
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB.
'What we want is to ensure that securities firms have the capital base, the
controls and the understanding of the risk.'
The move stemmed from talks last year between the SEC and the SIB and
follows a similar agreement between US and UK banking firms.
Mr Carter Beese, a commissioner at the SEC said: 'Over the past year there
has been a very high level of co-operation between banking and securities
authorities in the US.'
In addition to promoting internal management controls, the SEC and the SIB
want to ensure that firms understand how 'severe market conditions' affect
the value of their securities, that there be a common approach to the
accounting recognition, measurement and disclosure of positions and that
there be enhanced information sharing.
Mrs Barbara Holum, acting chairman of the CFTC, said the near-collapse of MG
Corp, the US arm of the German group Metallgesellschaft, due to oil and gas
derivatives dealings, underscored the urgency of such an agreement.
Over-the-counter derivative traders gave cautious endorsement to the pact,
saying it parallelled the agenda of international banking regulators.
'We had been concerned that the securities regulators might be moving in a
different direction,' on issues like transaction netting, said Mr Joseph
Baumann, President of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,
and director of global derivatives trading for Citibank.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Rail groups face Pounds 500m leasing charge for trains:
Treasury likely to offset extra cost with subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail companies that take over British Rail's passenger operations will pay
about Pounds 500m a year to lease the trains they will need.
This sum is in addition to the Pounds 2.2bn which the government said last
month the rail companies would have to pay for the right to run their trains
on the national rail network.
The government's programme to privatise BR involves creating three rolling
stock leasing companies, which will take over BR's existing trains and also
buy new ones for leasing to train operators. The operating companies will
not be required to lease their rolling stock but most are expected to do so.
Details of the leasing arrangements have been eagerly awaited by potential
bidders for BR franchises, which are expected to go on sale next year.
Negotiations between the Department of Transport, the Treasury, BR and
Hambros, the merchant bank that is advising on the rolling stock companies,
are continuing. The government is keen to establish a commercial regime for
pricing the leasing deals but this is proving difficult in the absence of an
existing market for rolling stock leases. Treasury approval for a leasing
regime has yet to be given.
In theory, the Pounds 500m leasing charge will not prove a burden to the
rail companies because it will be matched by an increase in the Treasury
subsidy. However, any increase in the subsidy requirement could demotivate
managers, some of whom have already expressed concern at the track charges
they will have to pay.
Potential bidders for rail franchises are concerned that very few details
have been released about the rolling stock companies less than three weeks
ahead of the formal creation of a devolved railway network on April 1.
Details of the leasing agreements were due to be announced to BR's operating
companies at a meeting in Reading earlier this month but the presentation
was called off at the last minute.
Appointments to the boards of the three rolling stock companies - two of
which will be based in London, with the third in Sheffield - have progressed
slowly and only one managing director designate is understood to have been
appointed.
The Department of Transport expects to reach an agreement on the details of
the leases by June and to have concluded agreements with the present BR
operating companies by September or October.
No detailed agreement has yet been reached on how the leasing charges will
be allocated to the 24 BR operating companies to be franchised. The charges
are unlikely to mirror the allocation of track charges because they will
depend on the type and age of the rolling stock in use.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK seeks Brussels' help on car sales dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government acknow-ledged yesterday that it was backing away from a
fight with carmakers, who have refused to comply with Monopolies and Mergers
Commission recommendations made more than two years ago aimed at giving
consumers a better deal.
Instead it is hoping that the results of a review of the way cars are
distributed and sold throughout Europe, currently being undertaken by the
European Commission, will remove the need for it to take any further action.
The announcement by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, provoked
an angry response from Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the
Consumers' Association.
'It is quite staggering that the government has not been able to reach an
agreement with manufacturers on the implementation of the MMC
recommendations on the supply of new cars,' he said.
'The MMC decision itself was weak and feeble in our view - more needed to be
done. The very fact that the government has been unable to persuade the car
industry to make the minimal changes recommended by the MMC is an appalling
reflection on the anti-competitive nature of the UK car industry.'
The MMC's report on car distribution and sales was instigated by the Office
of Fair Trading after consumer complaints that UK car prices were
excessively high compared with those of some continental European markets.
It found evidence of monopolies at work but concluded that they were not, of
themselves, necessarily against consumers' interests.
However, the report did identify a number of restrictions imposed by
carmakers on the activities of their dealers - such as limiting their
freedom to advertise outside their own sales territories - which it felt did
operate against the public interest, and recommended their removal.
However, the government hopes that many or all of the MMC's recommendations
will be imposed by the EC as part of its conditions for renewing the 'block
exemption' from EU competition rules under which carmakers are currently
allowed to restrict car sales through exclusive dealerships. The exemption
expires on June 30 1995.
The UK's 7,000-strong network of franchised car dealers, whose own position
would have been strengthened by enforcement of the MMC's recommendations,
last night expressed resigned disappointment at the move.

FT  16 MAR 94 / G7 ministers back free trade and labour flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations agreed
yesterday that free trade, labour market flexibility and a stable economic
environment were essential to tackle the persistent unemployment that has
afflicted all their economies.
However, the unprecedented two-day conference in Detroit produced 'no single
solution, no one idea or action that will work for every country,' said Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary and meeting chairman.
The conference yielded a consensus that countries must balance the right
macroeconomic policies with measures to attack longer-term structural
job-lessness.
'Structural reforms can make our labour markets and employment systems far
more adaptable to change. We need, carefully and in our own ways, to pursue
policies to take down barriers and to strengthen our markets,' Mr Bentsen
said.
Ministers agreed on the need to improve the education, training and skills
of their workforces, but Mr Bentsen warned that the G7 countries could
produce all the highly trained workers they wanted, 'but it does no good
unless we've created the climate in which the corporate world has jobs
waiting for them'.
The Detroit conference's conclusions will form the starting point for the
'sherpas' preparing July's summit meeting of G7 leaders in Naples. But
beneath the apparent harmony, divisions emerged, particularly on the
relative importance of government and the private sector.
'I won't say that there were sharp exchanges, but there were some courteous
sharp disagreements,' said Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary.
Among the most radical ideas that received support was a suggestion to allow
employees to work a fixed number of hours in the year, rather than each
week, allowing greater flexibility both for employers to deal with seasonal
variations and for workers to plan their own free time.
'At a time when modern technology gives us more and more flexibility, why
should work time still be planned as it was at the beginning of the
industrial revolution?' asked Mr Henning Christophersen, European Commission
vice-president.
Mr Bentsen said ministers had agreed to ask the Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development to study the relationship between
productivity, technology and job creation and to expand a study already
under way to improve statistics on joblessness in the industrial world.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers is in something of a bind. Tabloid newspaper sales
are in long-term decline with the Sun's price offensive sharpening the Daily
Mirror's falls. MGN is therefore keen to diversify. But with lowly-rated
shares and gearing of 73 per cent, the group is severely disadvantaged
against rivals boasting cash in hand and high-priced paper. MGN's proposed
alliance with Newspaper Publishing may yield some cost savings but the deal
remains marginal. The ingenuity of MGN's managers in unearthing expansion
opportunities will be fully tested.
At least MGN can keep profits moving by running its existing businesses more
efficiently. Trading margins - excluding restructuring charges - have
already risen to 24 per cent. But further gains should come from moving to
Canary Wharf and improved utilisation rates at its print plants. Advertising
revenue has been growing strongly as a result of some smarter newspaper
supplements and the general market bounce.
Arguably, MGN has been sensible in not responding more aggressively to price
wars. But the 1 per cent fall in circulation revenue suggests it is now
being badly burnt by the Sun. The real worry comes if the Mirror's decline
endangers its advertising rate card. With such doubts in mind, one can only
admire the prescience of the administrators in placing their stake last
September. Having outperformed the media sector by 44 per cent in the six
months before the placing, MGN has underperformed by 13 per cent in the six
months since.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's US producer price data confirmed the Federal Reserve's view that
America does not have an inflation problem. But industrial production and
capacity utilisation figures show why the bond market thinks it may be about
to get one. By most calculations, the US has closed the output gap which
opened during the recession. With capacity constraints now at their tightest
since 1989, further growth above the long-term trend will probably stir
inflation.
Growth may, however, moderate automatically - last year's fall in the
savings ratio is not sustainable and the recent rise in bond yields will
slow the housing market. But since most consumers will sit tight with
low-cost, fixed-rate mortgages, rising yields are not as effective a brake
as falling yields are a stimulus. And while the Fed's initial increase in
short-term interest rates has had a powerful psychological impact on
markets, its effect on the real economy is small. If the Fed becomes
concerned about the pace of expansion, it will have to push up short rates
more decisively.
That worry will probably keep the bond market on edge over the next few
months. Once the Fed acts, however, longer yields may stabilise and fall if
the threat of rising inflationary expectations recedes. Shares have remained
resilient despite the high anxiety of the bond market. That decoupling may
continue. If the rising output and falling unit wage cost figures are any
guide, there is a strong profits recovery out there for someone.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowly but surely Williams Holdings is digging itself out of the hole in
which it fell after its Racal bid failed. Full-year results show a rapid
advance of operating profit in the second half thanks in large measure to a
broader distribution base in the US. Cash generation is also improving with
Pounds 47m left over after capital spending, interest, tax and dividend
payments have been met. Just the same, in marking the shares up by a quarter
since late November, the market may have become carried away. The balance
sheet does not look strong enough to sustain much by way of cash
acquisitions. More paper might well meet resistance, especially since
dividend growth is likely to be pedestrian.
A significant part of the cash-flow improvement came from a squeeze on
working capital, continued restraint of capital spending, which is less than
half its peak in 1989, and a virtual end to spending of restructuring
provisions. Williams now needs to generate cash from its basic operations.
The presumption is that there will be a large beneficial effect from
increased volumes once recovery gets under way.
Yet Williams still does not seem to have much scope to raise prices. Higher
interest rates in the US and tax increases in the UK do not seem
particularly conducive to volume growth. There may be some years of dividend
restraint before Williams meets its target of two times cover. In the
meantime Hanson is on a higher yield and BTR seems likely to offer faster
earnings recovery.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Wolseley builds higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley has a habit of exceeding market expectations. Yesterday's 8 per
cent rise in the shares following the release of half-year figures is a case
in point. The company's reticence is partly the cause. More segmental
information and an interim cash flow statement, for example, might help
investors form a clearer view of what the future holds. The Stock Exchange's
new disclosure guidelines are certainly no justification for clamming up.
While the going is good shareholders will doubtless forgive, but such
shyness cuts both ways. Wolseley's creditable history of outperformance is
punctuated by some uncomfortably sharp corrections.
Yesterday's interim statement gives no immediate cause for concern. True,
Wolseley will not enjoy the conditions of the 1980s unless the housing
market is stoked into another frenzy. With inflation low, neither can it
count on stock profits to boost margins. But the 12 per cent increase in UK
sales shows how sensitive Wolseley's distribution business is to even a
modest upturn in building activity. Since profits from European distribution
rose by more than 50 per cent - with presumably little cheer coming from
France - the operational gearing is clear.
The acquisition of Brossette in France two years ago might also provide the
foundation for a wider European distribution network. If Wolseley can avoid
tripping on the acquisition trail there should be growth as well as recovery
to come. While the recent run-up in the shares argues for caution, that
prospect leaves long-term holders with little incentive to sell.

FT  16 MAR 94 / More flexible, and less arrogant friend: The outlook for a
UK-based computer company in a cut-throat marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Computers, the UK-based computer company, used to epitomise
arrogance and insularity. Even 'International' in the company's name begged
an invidious comparison with International Business Machines, the world's
largest computer company.
Stories of its conceit abounded. The chief salesman for a region, it was
said, would put up in the best hotel and announce he would be available that
evening in the parlour to take customers' orders for computers.
Since its acquisition, first by the UK telecommunications company STC in
1984 and then by Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer maker, in 1990, that
arrogance has evaporated. 'Today we are humbler and nimbler,' says Mr Peter
Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive.
Mr Koshiro 'Kit' Kitazato, Fujitsu's man in ICL's headquarters in Putney,
west London, is charged with co-ordination between the Japanese computer
giant and its UK-based subsidiary. He says ICL has learnt reliability from
Fujitsu, while Fujitsu has learnt flexibility from ICL.
Fujitsu set several strategic objectives at the time of the takeover. ICL
would be autonomous, operating at arm's length from its parent. It would
retain its European base, seek maximum commercial co-operation with Fujitsu
and, eventually, float on the London Stock Exchange.
The first few conditions have been fulfilled; the recession has delayed the
flotation. Both companies agree they should work more closely together to
share research and development, and marketing costs.
There have been some positive developments: ICL's new mid-range computers
are the first to be sold under the two companies' names; a pioneering
trainee exchange scheme is under way; the two groups are collaborating on
check-out systems for supermarkets; ICL's office software has been rewritten
to be marketed in Japan.
Despite these achievements, ICL's 1993 results, scheduled for release today,
will not be exciting. Turnover will be higher than last year's Pounds 2.5bn,
but pre-tax profits are expected to be well below the Pounds 38.6m recorded
for 1992. Profitability has been on the slide since 1989, when ICL made
Pounds 148.6m before tax. The 1993 figure represents little more than
break-even, though it is respectable in an industry undergoing global
restructuring.
ICL's top management is taking steps to safeguard the group's profitability.
Earlier this year, the company raised Pounds 100m through a rights issue
wholly taken up by Fujitsu - the first time the UK company had turned to its
parent for funds.
The issue reflects the group's pessimism over short-term prospects in the
computer marketplace, as the industry moves towards low-cost, low-margin
operating systems based on common standards.
Cash is one bulwark against a highly competitive market; an increasingly
efficient and lean operation is another. Mr Bonfield points to the steady
decline in the group's overheads. In 1987 operating expenses as a percentage
of turnover were 26.8 per cent; in 1992 the figure was 22.8 per cent and it
is expected to have fallen further in 1993. The company employs about 25,000
and is cutting jobs at about 5 per cent a year.
The reason for ICL's drive for economies is the relentless decline in gross
profit margin. Standing at 47 per cent in 1987, it is now less than 35 per
cent as the shift to lower-cost systems continues.
Nevertheless, ICL remains the only consistently profitable broad-based
computer manufacturer headquartered in Europe; worldwide, it is one of the
few traditional computer companies not floundering in red ink. By
comparison, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany and Olivetti of Italy are losing
money; and Groupe Bull of France is dependent on repeated restructuring
grants from the French government.
Mr Bonfield's reputation is high, both with Fujitsu and the industry at
large. He was recently asked by Mr Martin Bangemann, European Union
commissioner for industry and telecommunications, to join the High Level
Group on Information Technology, set up to consider the impact of
information technology on Europe. This is an indication that ICL has
restored its Euro credentials after being bundled out of high-level European
policy meetings following the Fujitsu takeover.
But restoring adequate profitability has proved more difficult. Though it
still manufactures mainframe computers, more than 50 per cent of ICL's
revenues come from the services sector. Competitors now include services
companies, such as Electronic Data Systems (EDS), and personal computer
makers, such as Compaq, as well as its traditional rivals, IBM, Unisys and
Digital Equipment.
According to Input, a US consultancy which tracks the computing services
business, ICL's improvement in market share in services ranks it fourth in
Europe behind the US companies Microsoft, Andersen Consulting and EDS.
The company has been split into 26 semi-autonomous businesses, each with
profit and loss responsibilities. There are three groups: industry systems,
including countries such as France and Portugal, under Mr Richard
Livesey-Haworth;
services, including Workplace Technologies and Sorbus Europe, the
maintenance company ICL owns with Bell Atlantic, under Mr Paul Whitwam;
and technology businesses, exemplified by Design to Distribution, ICL's
manufacturing consultancy, under Mr Ninian Eadie.
These changes, made over the past year, are evidence that the company is
going through a second significant restructuring. The first took place more
than a decade ago when, under Mr Robb Wilmot, ICL forged a technological
alliance with Fujitsu and pioneered the shift to standard systems. That was
when ICL abandoned cherished notions of setting the technological agenda and
accepted that it would have to buy its technology from the best sources.
Despite what many saw as the dead hand of STC, ICL prospered during the
buoyant economy of the late 1980s.
But both ICL and STC were aware the company needed an owner with deeper
pockets and greater commitment to the information technology business than
STC. The solution proved to be Fujitsu. It bought the company just before
the US and western Europe entered recession. At the same time, the cost of
computer hardware fell sharply, helped by a fierce price war between
personal computer manufacturers.
ICL's survival is a consequence of a flexibility uncommon in large
companies: 'In storms we are quite quick up the rigging, even if the planks
are leaking,' Mr Livesey-Haworth says wryly.
Much of this flexibility comes from a trio of acquisitions: Datachecker, a
US retail automation company which is the cornerstone of ICL's ambitions as
a global retail systems company; Nokia Data, the Finnish personal computer
company, which ICL bought in 1992; and Technology, the UK's largest personal
computer distributor.
Datachecker, as ICL's senior managers recall, was a case study in how not to
manage an acquisition. The company sent in its own manager and accountants
who ran rough-shod over local management. Sensitivities were bruised, so the
assimilation took longer and cost more than envisaged.
When ICL acquired Nokia Data, it was determined not to make the same
mistake. PC operations were consolidated in Scandinavia. The chief impact,
however, was cultural, a pattern repeated with the acquisition of
Technology. 'We needed a shot of the faster-moving PC culture,' Mr Eadie
says.
So what is ICL's future? It is likely to remain medium sized; it is unlikely
to make more money this year than in 1993, as Mr Bonfield sees no
improvement in the market. He believes, however, that ICL's reorganisation
will be complete this year. Largely freed from debt through the rights issue
and from restructuring charges, the company should return to significant
profitability in 1995, he predicts. This could mean profits eventually
reaching 5 to 6 per cent of revenues.
The worry now is not complacency, but battle fatigue: 'We drive this company
hard, but it's the only way to do it,' Mr Bonfield says. Mr Keith Todd,
finance director and chief strategist, agrees: 'We have gone through world
war three, but we cannot relax. The fight goes on.'

Whether or not Whitewater is more than an affair, it has clearly gripped the

Whitewater Rafting.
Hey guys, let's show a bit more creativity. In an effort to raise the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When does the Whitewater brouhaha turn into a scandal? The resignation of
Webster Hubbell, the US associate attorney general and US presidential
buddy, raises a question which is vexing careful newspaper editors.
Up to yesterday, Observer's electronic database showed a total of 347
references in the UK press to Bill and Hillary's Whitewater problems. There
were 178 mentions of 'scandal' and just 111 'affairs'. Poor old uproar,
fiasco, furore, blemish and slur don't warrant a mention; fuss gets just
one.
Of course statistics are no guide to anything. With the tally to date
standing at one suicide and two resignations, the verdict of one ex-member
of President Bush's administration is: 'Right now it's an affair. Four more
resignations, then it's a scandal.'

Take Johanna-Christina Grund, a German Euro-MP. She has floated the notion
that, given the high annual rent for the new parliamentary debating chamber
 -Ecu100m annually for 27 years - visitors should be charged an entry fee.
She says it should 'be at a similar level for national museums, zoos, etc in
Belgium'. MEPs might occasionally be mistaken for stuffed exhibits and
sometimes behave like animals; but really, let's have a pan-European

Not everyone hates Britain's motorway cones. Footballers like to use them to
practice their dribbling.
Indeed, Newcastle United has become so attached to the cones at its Durham
training ground that it has just had them kitted out in the club's colours.
Apparently, the Department of Transport's regulation red and white strip for
its motorway cones is identical to the colours of United's rivals -
Sunderland.
So United's manager Kevin Keegan turned to club vice-president, Tom Brown,
for help. When Brown is not watching United, he's chairman of
Northumberland-based RTM Group, which supplies cones and contra-flow
cylinders for motorway contractors.
No sooner had Keegan blown the whistle than Brown had paid Pounds 1,000 to
have his team's 50 red and white cones recovered in different colours so
they wouldn't clash with United's black and white team strip.

Sounds of merchant banks on the move in the City of London. No sooner has
BZW, Barclays' international investment bank, been given the green light to
move in to its parent's soon-to-be-vacated Royal Mint Court headquarters,
than word reaches Observer that Barings, the City's oldest merchant bank, is
also flitting.
Barings, which has been at 8 Bishopsgate since 1807, is coy about its future
movements. However, it is clear that, if it goes through with its plan to
combine its merchant bank and fast-growing securities business under one
roof, there is not going to be enough room for everybody at 8 Bishopsgate.
The obvious choice is for Barings to regroup at Baring Securities' vulgar
America Square headquarters near the Tower of London.
But that would mean Barings giving up its precious EC2 postcode, which it
shares with the Bank of England and other pukka members of the British
banking community. No doubt the young turks now running Barings couldn't
care less about their postcode.
But there are still some customers who worry about such things.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Masochistic voyeurs have enjoyed watching Birmingham's local government draw
up a list of candidates to recline on the bed of nails marked chief
executive; the present occupant, Roger Taylor, has decided to go early.
Why should intelligent bureaucrats step in between the warring fiefdoms of
council departments and combative councillors? It has to be the eighth
deadly sin: ambition. Brum is England's largest metropolitan authority.
The council is silent over who wants the Pounds 80,000-a-year job, but word
is that among the 10 names in the frame are two women - Sheffield's Pamela
Gordon and Southwark's Anna Wyatt. There is thus the intriguing possibility
of a female alliance emerging. Theresa Stewart, the current Labour leader,
faces difficult elections in May. Does she favour either Gordon or Wyatt?
The last woman chief executive in the West Midlands - at Sandwell -
eventually decamped for New Zealand. Must be something in the water . . .

FT  16 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Better fewer but better
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is growing concern at Westminster over the way that legislation is
drafted and passed. On Monday, Mr Howard Davies, director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, added the voice of the business community
to such worries. In a speech at the European Policy Forum, he called for an
overhaul of the legislative process, with more consultation, better drafting
and improved scrutiny.
The case for reform is strong. The weight of legislation is growing - this
year's Finance Bill, at 471 pages, is the longest in history. Yet an
increasing amount of time is spent on remedying the defects of recent
legislation. Last year's Criminal Justice Act repealed sentencing reforms
introduced in the 1991 Act. A one-clause bill is needed to restore the
powers of transport police, inadvertently watered down in last year's rail
privatisation act.
A telling indicator of the need for change is the growing number of
amendments the government has to table to its own legislation in the Lords.
These have more than doubled during the 1980s according to evidence
submitted by Lord Howe to the Hansard Society commission on the legislative
process which reported last year. The late drafting and tabling of
amendments inevitably makes parliamentary scrutiny less thorough. It also
makes it harder for business and other organisations to make an informed
contribution towards shaping legislation.
Drafting quality
Some of the blame for this has been laid at the door of the parliamentary
counsel who draft legislation. The European Policy Forum has recently
suggested breaking their monopoly to improve the quality of drafting.
Involving outside lawyers in the work would allow departments access to a
larger pool of talent. Contracting-out would also force departments to
define their objectives clearly and devise reasonable timetables that legal
firms could work to.
However, it is not bad drafting which has led to repeated amendments to the
Police and Magistrates Courts Bill currently passing through the Lords. It
is the failure of the home secretary, Mr Michael Howard, to convince peers
of the wisdom of centralising control over the police service. Mr John
Patten, education secretary, has also had to concede amendments to his
Education Bill to address scepticism over his proposals to curb student
unions and to allow schools to control teacher training. Better drafting
could improve the quality of legislation - but ministers have much more to
contribute.
Ministerial machismo
Too much legislation is rushed through parliament too hastily. In some
cases, this is to deal with political crises such as a surge in joy-riding
or a spate of attacks by dangerous dogs. But in most cases, it is
ministerial machismo which sees pushing through radical reforms as the best
way to climb the greasy pole. Frequent ministerial reshuffles encourage this
belief, since ministers move on before the trouble they have created
manifests itself.
A more serious approach to consultation on contentious changes in the law
would help counter such tendencies. Mr Davies says that some departments
consult business in 'an unsatisfactory or perfunctory way'. He cites the
Home Office failure to consult on fire safety regulations, scrapped only
after direct intervention by the CBI. And just three weeks was initially
given for comments on complex proposals to reform pensions law issued in
January. Ministers should give adequate time for consultation and report
more fully on the outcome.
Another useful step would be to limit the number of contentious pieces of
legislation passed in each session. This would allow more time for
legislative 'housekeeping', such as legal reforms drafted by the Law
Commission. Uncontroversial measures needed by business - such as amendments
to the Sale of Goods Act, legislation on the Privity of Contract and a new
Restrictive Practices Bill - have all been ready for years but denied
parliamentary time.
There are other measures that could improve the legislative process, such as
creating two finance bills to separate technical tax changes from more
radical policy changes. But the key to better legislation is have less of
it, and do it better.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Personal View: Time for the new Italy to take power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARLO DE BENEDETTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth and competitiveness are the world's dominant political
themes today. In North America and Asia, the main concern of government and
business is how to achieve a strong position in the global economy. Ideology
has been abandoned in favour of a pragmatic search for the quickest, surest
way to boost competitiveness and growth, and to turn the prospect of a new
cycle of international economic growth into reality.
In Europe, on the other hand, the break with the past is not so clear-cut.
Political attention seems to focus on the past rather than the future; on
defence rather than attack; on rejuvenating the old rather than creating the
new. The result is yet another year of missed business opportunities for
Europe, and rising unemployment to socially unacceptable levels.
This contradiction is even more evident in Italy. Here, political debate has
either failed to take account of the future now emerging; or it is confined
to impromptu, demagogic assertions that ignore the global competition Italy
should be preparing to meet, if it wishes to avoid being excluded from the
ranks of industrialised nations.
Now, in the run-up to an election that will be decisive for the country's
future, the electoral scene is far from inspiring.
On March 27 and 28, Italians go to the polls under a new electoral system -
the outcome of a referendum which vetoed the intolerable regime of
corruption and inefficiency generated by the lack of alternatives to the
dominant political system. For months, debate centred on how to create an
electoral system that would permit alternation between a progressive pole
and a conservative pole, enabling Italy to stand alongside the great western
democracies.
But partly because the new electoral law was the reluctant product of a
parliament forced to act by the result of the referendum, the elections will
take place in a climate dominated by three main factors.
First, the reality of transformation: to a great extent these elections are
in the hands of the offspring of the old political system, of whom the most
brazen representative is the standard-bearer of Forza Italia, together with
the embalmed remains of certain areas of the left.
Second, the risk to economic self-sufficiency: a real risk which lies
beneath the wonder cures promised by the right, or the sermons of the
outdated apologists of the left.
Third, confusion: the contest is riddled with left-over ideologies which
have been disinterred for the occasion.
Such suicidal behaviour may not be surprising coming from the new right; but
it is alarming when it appears among the more serious elements of the centre
and the left.
What politicians should be doing is explaining to the electorate that Italy
is not the centre of the world, or even of Europe; and that if we want to
remain at the forefront of world markets, we have to identify our
competitive advantages and abandon rearguard actions and verbal wars.
Behind all the manoeuvrings of the politicians, old and new, in this vital
election, there is a country which has decided to move on: this is the real
Italy. The country has grown. You need look no further than today's great
moral clean-up which, in its pursuit of a whole generation of corrupt
politicians, has reached a scale unparalleled in any other country.
Or the spirit of sacrifice displayed by countless citizens in the face of an
often chaotic, punitive fiscal system and an inefficient, oppressive public
sector.
Or the vigour and innovative capacity of an entrepreneurial class that has
reasserted its competitiveness despite the constraints under which it
operates. The remarkable improvement in the trade balance in 1993 from
L4,000bn to L50,000bn was not due entirely to devaluation.
This Italy must be represented politically by dignified action and thought.
The growing interest in its financial markets demonstrates that Italy's
international image is changing. And foreign observers' view of the new
Italy is far more accurate than the picture created by the election
campaign.
Italy cannot afford to forego the chance to take part in a new cycle of
growth in an ever more interconnected world. This will require rational
decisions, calculated sacrifices and an acceptable balance between recovery
and growth. It means social consensus and a government capable of plotting
an intelligent, pragmatic and credible course.
There is no room here for slogans and miracle makers. In today's world,
non-alignment with other nations means economic and social decline, with the
risk of losing the basic values of democracy and freedom.
This is the 'Italian risk' two weeks before the elections.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Summit for good jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The jobs summit in Detroit was never likely to come up with exciting new
solutions. What it could do was register agreement on the importance of the
topic and indicate the nature of the emerging consensus on what to do about
it. This the summit has done. In breaking new ground for the discussions
among the group of seven industrial countries, it may even have given that
intellectually moribund body new life.
Not that the G7's familiar macroeconomic disharmony was entirely absent. One
of the recurring leitmotifs of its two decades has been the US effort to
persuade the Germans to adopt more expansionary policies. The jobs summit
was partly an imaginative new way to achieve that old objective. The pitch
adopted by US labour secretary, Robert Reich, was that 'cyclical
unemployment which persists may turn into structural or classical types of
unemployment, which are more difficult to address'. The argument is correct,
but it cuts two ways. Rising inflation must also be avoided, because it
leads to recession as surely as night follows day. It is not clear that the
Clinton administration understands this point.
If a transatlantic consensus on macroeconomic policy is lacking, the
agreement elsewhere was encouraging. The summit has, for example, rejected
protection against imports and embraced innovation, rightly so, in both
cases. Labour intensive imports and new technology will make industrial
countries richer. But, as Mr Reich observes, they also exact a price. 'The
primary structural labour market problem,' he notes, 'is a shift in relative
labour demand against less-educated workers and those doing routine tasks
and towards workers with problem solving skills.'
Increased inequality
In the US, the result has been increased inequality, with workers in the
higher earnings bracket enjoying a 4.4 per cent increase in real wages over
the past 20 years, while those on the bottom suffered a 10.3 per cent real
decline. Because there was no overall real wage growth, US employment also
grew by some 40 per cent. In continental Europe, by contrast, average real
wages grew rapidly over the past two decades - by 76 per cent in France and
43 per cent in Germany. There was also very little increase in pay
inequality. But these countries enjoyed virtually no employment growth,
while unemployment rose, cycle by cycle.
The question then is not whether jobs can be created. It is obvious that
they can be. The question is whether those new jobs can be combined with
sustained rises in average real wages and the pay equality to which
Europeans, in particular, are attached. The challenge is not just more jobs;
it is 'good jobs' for everyone.
Holy grail
Secretary Reich's own suggested solution is the trio of European-style
education and training, US-style labour market flexibility and expansionary
macroeconomic policy. So is this the holy grail for jobs? Only up to a
point, Mr Reich.
Yes, education and training matter, but high-quality basic education matters
most, a policy that may never work for all and certainly will not act
quickly. Yes, labour market flexibility is essential, but this is a
euphemism for policies that will lower the relative and quite possibly the
absolute real wage of the unskilled, precisely what Europeans - and
increasingly Americans - find objectionable. And yes, macroeconomic policy
must accommodate growth, but even Padraig Flynn, European commissioner for
employment, agrees that 'there is a new conventional wisdom that cyclical
recovery will not be the way out'.
There is room for a great deal of imaginative new thinking of the kind
contained in a new pamphlet from the London-based think-tank Demos on 'the
end of unemployment'. But at the heart of that thinking must be ways to
lower the cost of hiring new employees. If at the same time rewards are to
be sustained, large employment subsidies for the unskilled will be required,
instead of the taxes often imposed upon them. But that would necessitate
higher taxes elsewhere. Combined with subsidies for training and radical
labour market deregulation, this is the only policy likely to put industrial
countries on the path they are apparently seeking.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why Wales resists change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOSEPHINE FARRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Philip Stephens' article, 'PM urged to shelve
radical plans' (March 14), on growing pressure for the government to delay
implementing local government reorganisation in England until after the next
general election. I hope the same 'consolidators' to whom he refers will
also press the prime minister to drop the unpopular proposals for changing
Welsh local government.
Only one in five in the principality supports the government's plans to
establish 21 so-called unitary authorities at a cost of Pounds 201m. If the
people of Wales, members of the Confederation of British Industry, Trades
Union Congress, voluntary organisations and the overwhelming majority of
Welsh MPs oppose this proposal, how can English MPs justify forcing it on
them? They could not have sent a clearer message to Whitehall. For a
government that claims to want to listen to the people, it is certainly keen
to ignore the wishes of the Welsh. They have not been given an independent
commission to examine council structure.
We can only hope the same ministers now making such pragmatic noises about
reforming English local government will speak up for Wales.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Colin Amery ('A lifeline for the South Bank', March 14) falls into the
trap which catches so many of those who write about architecture - he
assumes that external appearance is everything. In praising the Festival
Hall, while damning the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Hayward Gallery, he takes
no account of the ability of each building to fulfil its true function
successfully.
In the ways in which a concert hall can enhance a musical performance and
its enjoyment, by the musicians and audience, the RFH is the worst venue,
not just in London, but in all the main centres in Europe. The QEH, on the
other hand, ranks with the Wigmore as the best in this respect.
Among galleries, the Hayward exhibition space complements 20th century works
in a way that is matched by no other leading London site. To suggest that
buildings do not fulfil their real purpose superbly, merely because a vocal
section of opinion deems them to be ugly on the outside, is a very poor
application of values and priorities.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a recent change in English
company law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E A COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Jean Thibaud's article on recent developments in French banking and
company law was most informative (Business and the Law: 'Overthrow of ancien
regime', March 8).
Allow me, however, to correct what appears to be an inaccuracy in the
article. Mr Thibaud states, in the fourth paragraph, that 'England has
recently accepted netting (ie. set-off) as a basic principle of insolvency
law. . .'. In point of fact, bankruptcy/insolvency set-off has been the rule
in England since the time of Queen Anne (see s11 of 45 Anne c17), if not
before (see s2 of the 1570 statute, 13 Elizabeth, c7).
Perhaps Mr Thibaud's reference to a 'recent' acceptance of netting in
England was a reference to the (somewhat belated) recognition by the
financial law panel of the principle of insolvency set-off (see the panel's
guidance note on netting of November 19 1993).

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scottish salmon competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JIM PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the letter 'Scottish salmon also subsidised' (March 14), Mr Roderick
Thomas wildly exaggerates the level of support which has been received by
the Scottish salmon farming industry. Moreover, in every case, any support
for the industry has been completely in accordance with European Union
rules.
Contrary to what he states, Norway has no natural advantages over Scotland
for growing salmon. This is why the performance of Scottish farms is now as
good, or possibly better, than those in Norway.
There is no truth in the statement that Norwegian salmon farms are
profitable at a price of 20 per cent to 30 per cent lower than the cost of
production in Scotland. The most careful analysis reveals that costs of
production are roughly comparable in both countries.
Mr Thomas is also wrong about the threat from Chile. Chile can compete only
in Europe on frozen salmon. The freight cost for fresh salmon from Chile to
Europe makes that business uneconomic. Otherwise, of course, there would be
fresh salmon arriving in Europe now, at a time when the Chileans are
vigorously searching for new markets.

Sir, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has called for councils to
handle standard enquiries 'within 10 working days' ('Quicker land searches
urged', March 12).
In the last years of the 20th century this is an absurd call. Mr Gummer
should seek to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the whole of the
conveyancing process should become a real-time screen-to-screen process. The
hardware, the software and the technical know-how to effect this are all
immediately available to his department. At a stroke, conveyancing could, if
the will were there, become a fast, efficient and cheap process which would
benefit 99 per cent of the nation at the expense of 1 per cent (the

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Heading down unhealthy path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN BEITH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alison Smith's report, 'Building societies aim to shake off shackles'
(March 10), underlines the hostility of some building society executives to
any form of accountability to their members, whose capital they manage.
When I raised this issue of accountability in a speech to the Building
Societies Association a few months ago, I received an intriguing mixture of
public criticism and private support. The leading article in Mortgage
Finance Gazette asserted in reply that society boards and the Building
Societies Commission should take active steps to prevent the election as
directors of people not chosen by the current directors, and questioned
'whether mutuality meant anything more than not being required to pay
shareholders dividends'.
The government even suggests that building societies, which constantly mail
advertising material to their members, should be relieved of the burden of
notifying them by post of their voting rights at the annual general meeting.
Some people in the industry do recognise that a complete absence of
accountability, even if regulation became more effective, would be extremely
unhealthy. However, that is the way things are heading.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Futile and flawed: The UK cannot impose its vision of Europe
on its EU partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to make strategic sense of the British government's campaign to
restrict majority voting in Europe. Yes, I know ministers are frightened of
the anti-Europeans in their party; and presumably they hope to appease them
with a vigorous stand in defence of national sovereignty. But the problem is
that this is a crusade which is certain to fail in the medium term, and
probably in the short term as well.
In any case, why go out on a limb now? The Maastricht treaty was such a
miserable experience for Mr John Major that you would think the prime
minister would do his best to steer clear of all questions of principle
about Europe and its development for as long as possible. Yet here he is,
taking a combative stand on an issue which is bound to involve a battle on
two fronts: it must lead to an unwinnable confrontation with his partners in
Europe, but it must also stir up the anti-European campaigners among those
who are nominally his own supporters. This is a spectacular exercise in
political masochism.
This crusade is doomed to defeat, because its underlying objectives set the
UK at odds with virtually all its European partners. The government pretends
that it is only asking that the voting rules which protect blocking
minorities in the Council of Ministers should be kept at the present level,
even after the admission of four more member states: 23 votes, or the
equivalent of two big countries and one small.
The reality, of course, is that the British government is trying to make
majority voting more difficult than at present; whereas effective
decision-making in a larger Union will obviously require more majority
voting, not less.
The puzzle is that the Conservative government seems to have been manoeuvred
by its Euro-phobic wing into refighting the last war but one. The windmill
it is tilting at is the old fantasy that Britain's national sovereignty is
threatened by the sinister federalists in Brussels; and it appears to
imagine that it can creep by stealth back in the direction of a national
veto. It does not seem to realise that the terms of the debate have been
changed beyond recognition.
Many years ago, in 1965-66, the Community had a shattering confrontation
between France and the rest, over the rights and wrongs of majority voting.
That was before majority voting was due to come into force as part of the
Community's normal regime, and the French were trying to prevent it
happening. After a six-month confrontation, a truce was signed in 1966 which
was afterwards called the Luxembourg Compromise, even though there had been
no compromise on anything. Nevertheless, the psychological shock of the
crisis effectively deterred majority voting for 20 years.
But the Luxembourg Compromise was wiped off the slate by the 1986 Single
European Act, which explicitly broadened the scope for majority voting; and
the agenda on the slate was rewritten by the Maastricht treaty, which also
carried the majority voting trend even further.
As a result, today's central question about majority voting is the reverse
of yesterday's: it is not whether a member state can be compelled by
majority vote to do things it would rather not do, but whether it can use
its national veto to prevent most or all of its partners from doing what
they collectively want to do.
It is now clear that the first, old-fashioned question can have several
different answers. Most rational people now recognise that the purpose of
majority voting is not to out-vote the recalcitrant, but to persuade them to
negotiate and to compromise. But for those who will not negotiate and will
not submit, there is the alternative of the opt-out: if you don't like the
journey, you can leave the ship.
That was the double lesson of Maastricht: the other member states could not
compel the UK to accept the social chapter, or the Danes to accept monetary
union or indeed anything else in the treaty; but nor, in the last resort,
could Britain and Denmark prevent the others from going ahead with the
treaty they had compromised on. In the long run, the majority will get the
kind of Europe they want, and the options for those who disagree will
essentially be quite simple: to compromise, to submit, or to stand aside. If
majority decisions are blocked inside the Council of Ministers, through
systematic legal obstruction, they will be taken outside, in some other way.
If the British government is now trying to strengthen the legal methods of
obstruction, it is perhaps because it is slowly dawning that the opt-out is
not a satisfactory type of solution.
The plan for economic and monetary union may well prove an acute test case,
and it is likely to come to a head during the 1996 Inter-Governmental
Conference to review and revise the Maastricht treaty. At that moment, it
will be clear which member states are still committed to monetary union. And
it is quite possible that an inner core will be ready to go ahead to a
single currency, conceivably in a very near future. Mr Major will then be
left holding his opt-out, which means he cannot stop them, just as it means
he cannot join them.
Note that the concept 'blocking minority' does not exist in any European
treaties. What they lay down is the number of positive votes required to
pass a measure; at present 54 out of 76. The underlying assumption is that
the governments which signed the treaties share a broad political consensus
on the purpose of their association. That consensus did not exist in 1965.
But the French lost that battle for one simple reason: they could not impose
their view of Europe then, and it is time the British saw that they cannot
impose their view of Europe now.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Essential, or just extra baggage: Is bigger better in the
global business travel industry?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If employees of Foseco, the Birmingham-based metallurgical company, try to
book business class tickets when they should be flying economy, Wagonlit
Travel will let Mr John Lamb know.
Mr Lamb, Foseco's chief accountant, says the company's contract with
Wagonlit gives it far greater control over business travel costs than it
could ever achieve alone.
Wagonlit's technology enables Mr Lamb to obtain, at 24 hours' notice, a
computerised record of where employees have travelled recently and whether
they got the best deal available. If they have not, he asks them why.
Wagonlit, which is part of Accor, the French hotel and catering group,
yesterday announced details of its plan to combine its business travel
interests with those of Carlson of the US to create a worldwide network with
combined revenues of Dollars 10.8bn, operating from 4,000 locations in 125
countries.
Two main competitors, American Express and Thomas Cook, each operate from
about 2,000 locations - either their own offices or those of client
companies.
The two sides in the partnership said the new company, Carlson Wagonlit
Travel, aimed to 'service the growing needs of the global business
traveller, to market the new brand worldwide, develop new global business
travel technology and pursue immediate expansion into new business markets
throughout the world, in particular the Asian and Pacific regions'.
Mr Curt Carlson, the founder of the Carlson empire, says the combined travel
company will be able to improve services to clients such as General
Electric, which places its Dollars 350m-a-year travel business with Carlson
in Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr Carlson, whose company's other interests include Radisson Hotels and TGI
Friday's restaurants, which are not part of the merged venture, says: 'Big
companies often have difficulty with their travel, operating in new
countries where agencies often just speak the local language and airlines
use different (ticket) codes.'
Carlson will contribute its strengths in the US to Wagonlit's strong
position in Europe. The newly-merged company will invest an initial Dollars
40m in setting up or buying agencies in Asia, the Pacific region, Latin
America and Africa, where it is under-represented.
Why did they choose each other? Mr Herve Gourio, president of Wagonlit
Travel, says: 'Carlson is the best partner for us because we are about the
same size in the travel business and at the group level. Neither is
predominant, European or American.'
Mr Travis Tanner, president of Carlson Travel, promises 'a real working
union to create the number one in business travel. Not a paper partnership,
nor a smoke and mirrors arrangement.' He said Carlson 'needed a prominent
position in Europe - to have done it ourselves would have taken a great deal
of time and money'.
Rivals in the industry, however, were quick to cast doubt on the prospects
of merging two organisations with such different cultures. 'This is not a
marriage made in heaven,' said one rival business travel executive. 'I can't
see the Americans being run by the French, or vice-versa.'
The new company will have two chairmen, one from Carlson and one from
Wagonlit, and two chief executives, also one from each side. Although the
company headquarters will be in London, the two sides said 'daily operations
will be co-ordinated from Minneapolis and Paris respectively'.
Carlson, one of the largest privately-owned groups in the US, is seen in the
travel industry as run with a firm hand from its Minneapolis headquarters.
Wagonlit, which has gone through a series of changes and acquisitions, is
regarded as still formulating its culture.
Accor acquired Wagonlit, which had taken over the UK business travel
interests of Pickfords, in 1992. The company was then called Wagons-Lits,
but changed its name to Wagonlit last year to distinguish itself from
Accor's railway services division, which still uses the old name.
The planned new company brings together some of the oldest names in the
travel business. Carlson's travel business began as the Ask Mr Foster travel
agency in St Augustine, Florida, in 1888, making it the oldest travel agency
in the US. Its name came from a local resident, Mr Foster, who was the
unofficial keeper of train timetables. Carlson acquired Ask Mr Foster in
1979.
Wagonlit was founded in 1872 to provide sleeping cars for overnight
travellers on European trains. In 1928 it set up travel agencies in rail
ticket offices throughout Europe.
For over 60 years, Wagonlit had an alliance with Thomas Cook. The thinking
behind the tie was that Thomas Cook's strength in the old British Empire
would complement Wagonlit's power in continental Europe. The link was
dissolved in 1989.
In a pointed statement yesterday, Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook's
chief executive, said: 'Since we decided to sever our relationship with
Wagonlit, we have been building the Thomas Cook network by working with
like-minded partners who put customer service first. Forming alliances is
only the beginning of the relationship and major industry players such as
ourselves will be watching the progress of this alliance with interest.
However, it will be customers who will judge its real value.'
Not all Wagonlit's customers see merit in the merger or in the idea that
companies need a single business to handle their travel requirements
worldwide.
Mr Lamb says Foseco does not even have the same travel agents as Burmah
Castrol, its parent company, which uses Thomas Cook. Foseco was already
using Wagonlit when it was acquired by Burmah Castrol in 1990. Although the
company asks different agencies to bid for its travel account every two or
three years, it has seen no need to abandon Wagonlit, which has two staff
members based at Foseco's premises.
Mr Lamb says that Foseco and Burmah Castrol did decide jointly to seek
discounts from airlines as their larger combined purchasing power enabled
them to get a better deal. They have investigated using a single travel
agency throughout the group, but decided there were no similar savings to be
made. The larger combined purchasing power would not have yielded bigger
discounts.
Mr Lamb believes there are advantages to having two travel agencies working
for different parts of his group. He says: 'We believe it keeps both of them
on their toes.'
Mr Lamb is sceptical of the claim that combining Wagonlit with Carlson will
enable the combined group to deliver a more competitive service. He says:
'My answer to that is: if getting much bigger means you can purchase so much
more efficiently, kindly tell us how much that's going to benefit us in
discounts.'
The proposed merger does have its champions, however. Mr Andrew Solum,
travel manager of Inmarsat, the international satellite organisation, which
is also a Wagonlit customer, says it should bring significant benefits.
After taking on Wagonlit last year to handle travel arrangements from its
London headquarters, Mr Solum was sufficiently impressed to ask them to do
the same for Inmarsat's offices in Princeton, New Jersey. Six weeks ago, the
organisation opened an office in Beijing, where Wagonlit is not represented.
Mr Solum hopes the planned merger will enable Carlson Wagonlit Travel to
open an office there.
He says the idea of a global travel agency network is more than mere hype.
If his organisation's employees are bumped off flights in different parts of
the world, he says a call from Wagonlit to the airline often gets them back
on the aircraft. The wider a travel agency network's reach, the more places
there are where it can perform such services.
He says: 'Wherever you are in the world, if you've got a Wagonlit ticket,
you can go into a local office if you've got a problem. You've got somewhere
to go if you've been robbed.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: Farewell to a nice little era - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So - as Private Eye's teenage poet EJ Thribb would say, farewell Minder,
Absolutely Fabulous and The Man From Auntie: your catchphrases were 'A nice
little earner', 'Be a good girl and make Mummy a capuccino' and 'My name's
Ben Elton good night'. Thursdays won't be the same without you. True, it
would be surprising if we had to wait long before Elton, now such a wholly
professional comedian, was back, and the BBC people claim there will be
another series of Absolutely Fabulous though they cannot say when. As for
Minder, it has run for 107 episodes, and, although they have cried wolf
before and then relented and given us more, it does seem as though one-off
'specials' are all we shall get in future.
The days when television schedules were carved in granite and changed with
the seasons just three times a year, seem to have gone for ever. Series that
run for even 13 episodes, never mind 26, are now rare. Switch on ITV next
Thursday at 8.30, the time when Minder has been going out, and you will see
the first in a half-hour series called Outside Edge, worked up by Richard
Harris from his splendid stage comedy about oddly matched couples in a
cricket club. So far there are just seven episodes.
Meanwhile, if you switch on ITV at 8.30 tomorrow night, you can make an
interesting comparison. Filling in for just one week is a Minder repeat, the
first episode ever made, called 'Gunfight At The OK Laundrette' (a spelling
which could explain the title of Hanif Kureishi's 1985 script My Beautiful
Laundrette). From the upbeat signature tune to the location filming of
London, from the central importance of the tough Terry McCann character to
the subordinate role played by George Cole's laughable Arthur Daley, this
shrieks of what it actually was: an effort by the Thames TV subsidiary
Euston Films to take the most notable aspects of The Sweeney and turn them
into a vehicle for Dennis Waterman who had played the rough diamond sergeant
in that police series. When you see in this first Minder episode armed
police leaping from a Transit van, filmed from overhead, there is no
mistaking the programme's antecedents.
As time went by Waterman's limitations and Cole's strengths became clear,
and the centre of gravity changed. Once McCann ceased to be the flywheel of
the series there was less need for violent action and Minder became more a
comedy of manners and character. Making the last episode mirror the first,
by having Arthur instead of his minder taken hostage, served to emphasise
the ways in which it had evolved. On the other hand Absolutely Fabulous has
rarely been anything more than a comedy of manners. There have been one or
two powerful inventions to relish, for instance the loathing of Patsy, the
sixties reprobate, for Saffron, the sanctimonious greenie teenie, a loathing
which cuts right across the grain of today's adulation of yoof and
environmental agonising.
However, that has been the exception, not the rule. The rule in Ab Fab has
been a type of comedy that relies upon dialogue in a way that makes it
almost as suitable for radio as for television. Interestingly, and somewhat
ironically, the comedy series starring Dawn French, Murder Most Horrid,
which now provides a comedy substitute on Thursday nights, is far more
concerned with dramatic 'business' and the physical aspects of comedy.
(Perhaps French and Saunders could get together and pool their varied
talents; what a partnership . . .) Unlike so many series, Murder Most Horrid
fully justifies the phrase 'situation comedy'.
In the opening episode French's attempt to hang herself was interrupted by
the arrival of a professional assassin intent upon killing a man in a
building across the street. She fits French with a walkie-talkie and sends
her across to do the dirty work, but security guards present problems.
Persuaded over the r/t to offer them 'blow jobs', a phrase that means
nothing to her, French bumps them off one at a time in the gents. Written by
Steven Moffat, this had the same sort of appeal as A Fish Called Wanda.
Remarkably episode 2, with a script by Paul Smith and Terry Kyan, proved
equally good and just as funny, with French appearing to be the unbearably
gossipy hostage of a bank robber but in the end turning all the tables.
The small spate of new series in what would once have been mid-season was
swollen on Sunday night by two in succession from BBC1: yet another comedy,
and yet another drama series about an oddball police detective. On the
evidence of the opening episodes, they do not look likely to challenge
French or Saunders for comedy laurels, or Minder for the qualipop drama
crown. The comedy, Honey For Tea, stars Felicity Kendal as a drop-dead
gorgeous American widow who has brought her hunk of a son, Jake, to
Cambridge to inveigle him into the college funded by his late father, while
wheedling herself a job in the bursar's office.
It is a good enough scenario, but Michael Aitkens, creator of the superb
Waiting For God, has mystifyingly opted for American and British stereotypes
which are two generations out of date. Silly ass Cambridge dons baffled by
Americanisms went out with mortar boards: today they take their cue from
David Lodge and earn fortunes on the international conference circuit. And
rich Americans, raised on a PBS channel diet of British costume drama, do
not split their sides at the notion of hunting anything as small as a fox.
As for Pie In The Sky, with Richard Griffiths as the reluctant detective who
wants to leave the police and run a restaurant but is being blackmailed into
staying (a thin variation on the old 'one last mission' routine) we shall
have to see. So far the foodie content looks more convincing than the police
element, but the important question will be whether this is written from the
character outwards, or is just another contrived formula: 'Let's put him in
a wheelchair] Oh no, Ironside. Well make him an antique dealer then - damn,
Lovejoy. How about a gourmet cook? Yes, that'll do . . .' Still, you never
know: Minder was produced to a formula with a purpose rather than bursting
from the breast of an impassioned writer, and that lasted 15 years.

The effects of Thatcherite reforms on the NHS are beginning to surface, like
the oil-smeared detritus from a depth-charged submarine. BBC1's new tabloid
current affairs magazine, Here And Now, promises us a top surgeon who has
gone undercover to expose the goings-on at NHS HQ in Leeds (7.30).
Dispatches shows how fewer patients are referred to specialists, and how
teams of experts are being disbanded as a result (9.00 C4).
Not before time BBC2 screens a programme questioning the modern tendency to
put children on pedestals and give them everything they want: Spoiling The
Child? Goodness knows what the question mark is for. As with the 'What
ghouls]' reaction of ghoulish newspaper reports from Gloucester, there is
some irony here: television is a major contributor to the transformation of
children into tin gods (8.10 BBC2).
BBC2's filmed drama slot, 'Screen Two', offers a story called All Things
Bright And Beautiful about a 10-year-old Irish altar boy who, in 1954,
starts to see visions of the Virgin Mary (9.00).

FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: Beckett's Footfalls - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Long after the performance of a Samuel Beckett play ends, its meanings go on
gathering. Plays seldom come shorter than his Footfalls (1976), and yet its
brief mysteries lodge such a wealth of suggestion and connection in your
head that it can effectively fill a whole evening.
The play, which lasts less than 20 minutes, has just come to the West End
for a week, two performances per night (7.30 and 9.30), all tickets at
Pounds 4, with Deborah Warner directing Fiona Shaw and Susan Engels. The
problem is whether Warner and Shaw help you to attend to the play as much as
to their own way with it.
The two women of Footfalls are mother and daughter. The mother is a voice
(Engels), unseen; the daughter, May (Shaw), a woman now in her forties, whom
we see, continually and audibly paces this way and that, as she goes over
the past in her mind. She has never recovered from some early shock or
shocks; it is possible that she has never recovered from being born. Voice
of mother: 'I had you late. (Pause.) In life. (Pause.) Forgive me again.'
Each woman looms in the other's mind. May (after pacing): 'Were you asleep?'
Voice: 'Deep asleep. (Pause) I heard you in my deep sleep. (Pause) There is
no sleep so deep I would not hear you there.'
Here, as throughout, how many implications a line can have. The numerous
implications of this last line include: Big Mother is hearing you; so deep
is my love for you that your voice will never go unheard by me; the
umbilical cord between us is unbroken and troubles me still; I would sleep
easy were it not for you; you are a voice in my dreams; I will hear you even
when I reach the great sleep of death; you keep breaking into my sleep and
you always will; I can never sleep easy where you are concerned. . .
Since we never see the mother, we may well come to interpret her voice as a
voice within her daughter's mind: in which case that line acquires further
connotations: Mother, I will always wake you; Mother, you will never escape
me; Mother, I will always haunt you; and more.
There is probably not a meaning in the play that Fiona Shaw and Deborah
Warner have not thought about - though they choose to ignore a few of
Beckett's precise instructions. (He required that May's feet be heard but
not seen, and that she have grey hair and a gray wrap. Shaw's stockinged
legs and sandalled feet can be seen; likewise her dark hair and red dress.)
Shaw's obsessive intensity, her wit, her ability to alternate voices, her
Irishness, all pay dividends. And so does Engel's ponderous, cultivated
contralto.
Warner's most daring stroke is to have Shaw spend most of the play not
onstage but on a special platform in the centre of the dress circle; and to
have Engel's voice emerge from beneath her, so that Shaw, in the very centre
of the audience, seems to pace upon her mother's tomb.
But must Shaw and Warner reveal their talent in so self-advertising a
manner? Shaw's withered-old-maid posture is too obviously contrived; her
sexually frustrated fiddlings at the folds of dress before her crotch are
over-emphatic; and her little-girl petrified-virgin voice makes the whole
affair artificial.
In some ways, Footfalls seem to encapsulate all those other Shaw-Warner
collaborations that London has seen in recent years (Electra, The Good
Person of Sichuan, Hedda Gabler). I do not mean that as much of a
compliment. Thanks largely to Warner, Shaw has developed in recent years a
dreadfully solipsistic way of acting, as if there were no one else onstage;
thanks also to Warner, she has become our most emphatic exponent of female
neurosis and/or victimisation and/or masochism. True, Footfalls is a far
more appropriate vehicle for all this than those other plays - but those of
us who have been through the other Shaw-Warner collaborations may well feel
that this is just more of the same.
At the Garrick Theatre until April 19.
Presented by Deborah Warner and Maison de la Culture, Bobigny, Paris.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: Stars in their own right - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great composers of the romantic era are fair game these days for
conductors from the period-instrument movement. Twenty years ago Bach and
Handel were still being played by symphony orchestras; 10 years ago people
argued that 'authentic' Haydn and Mozart would never catch on.
Each decade the authentic brigade moves on to its next hunting ground.
Norrington and Gardiner have already tackled Berlioz and Brahms, both making
a particularly good job of the latter's German Requiem. Now Nikolaus
Harnoncourt, known in his earlier days for his Monteverdi operas and Bach
cantatas, has caught up with them. The enormous success of his Beethoven
symphony cycle made further progress into the 19th century inevitable.
There is one big difference with Harnoncourt. When he conducts classical or
romantic music he prefers to work with conventional orchestras - although he
does his level best to turn them into honorary period musicians. The
admirable young players of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe look wholehearted
converts: the double-bass players play standing up, the timpanist sits on a
low chair and the violins renounce their usual vibrato.
In Harnoncourt's hands they become a lithe, red-blooded orchestral animal,
with lean strings and snarling brass, ready to pounce at their conductor's
next command. There is a high quota of aggression in Harnoncourt's
conducting and it made itself felt from the beginning of Friday's Barbican
concert with a trenchant performance of Beethoven's Coriolan Overture.
There was no soloist, which may account for a disappointing audience (though
a noisily appreciative one). The central work was Schumann's Fourth
Symphony, so different in style from Leppard's recent Schumann cycle that
regular Barbican concert-goers might have wondered if they were listening to
the same composer. Where Leppard was fluent and graceful, Harnoncourt dug
into the music with zealous determination.
This is a conductor who always likes to spring a surprise. In Brahms's First
Symphony he did not drive relentlessly along, as one might have expected,
but found time for relaxation as well. If the music still sounded stark, one
suspects that for Harnoncourt overturning a century's tradition of glowing
romantic performances is half the delight. As he raced triumphantly through
the final brass chorale, the adrenalin count hit danger level. Other Brahms
conductors, beware.
Education work in the community has become a prime responsibility of
Britain's orchestras, but it costs money. On Monday the London Symphony
Orchestra held a gala concert in aid of the LSO Endowment Fund to raise
support for its education programme and invited Jessye Norman as the star
attraction - a useful insurance policy if the ticket prices are going to be
that high.
A solo recital on the South Bank earlier this year proved that Jessye Norman
can fill a hall alone at prices most orchestras in this country would long
to charge for large-scale symphony concerts. As that occasion showed, she
has been adventurous in learning new music, while the spontaneity has been
going out of the old. Perhaps a singer needs constant renewal as an artist
to keep up the momentum.
For this concert she was joined by Colin Davis, LSO principal
conductor-elect and a long-time colleague (they share a record company).
They had put together a programme equally shared between two composers,
tempting speculation that each of them would excel in one half: Britten for
him, Strauss for her. Of course, it never works out that simply.
Britten's late cantata Phaedra was written for a mezzo (Janet Baker) and has
usually been sung by mezzos, but it falls very comfortably for Jessye
Norman's low-ish soprano. Alone of the singers I have heard in it, she
experienced no strain at the top. The very fullness of the voice adds
another side to the character. In some of her singing of late, the extrovert
outward signs of involvement have concealed a deadness at the core, but not
here: Phaedra's inner torment and shame were fully alive, the beating heart
of a rounded portrayal.
There was no lack of heart in her Strauss, the closing scene from Capriccio.
In fact, the sheer generosity of the voice and the personality was too much
of a good thing. There is a cool, elegant poise written into the music of
Strauss's Countess, which is smothered if the vocal line bulges with heated
emotion and verbal emphasis. True Strauss stylists like Janowitz take a more
refined line. Nevertheless, Jessye Norman was in lustrous voice. The star
appeal still shines brightly.
In between came two orchestral items which were definitely not fillers. It
is a luxury to hear the Four Sea Interludes from Britten's Peter Grimes
played by a top orchestra and the LSO showed what a difference it makes. The
partnership with Davis is promising a splendid future, his mature wisdom and
their panache combining in a fine performance of Strauss's Don Juan. If the
LSO continues to play as well as this, it can be the star in its own gala
concert next time.
LSO concert sponsored by American Airlines; it is repeated on March 17

FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: 'Etoiles' go for gold - Ballet in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris Opera Ballet occasionally gives its brightest young dancers a run
of special performances in which to show their very considerable mettle. So,
at the weekend, the aspirant etoiles, feet as bright as their hopes,
technique as burnished as their confidence in their training, made a bid for
glory. It was, as always, an exhilarating spectacle. The Palais Garnier was
crowded and the atmosphere charged with that special French belief in
gloire. And on Saturday afternoon the young went for gold.
Chief ballet-master Patrice Bart centred this year's sessions around the
Romantic ballet. So there was Bournonville, looking - shall we say  - a bit
French-polished, and evocations of Marie Taglioni's roles; the enchanting
Vivandiere sextet which has survived for a century and a half thanks to
notation, and Petipa's Paquita trio. We saw golden gifts; we must hope for
golden futures and golden rewards. Certainly the performance demonstrated
the grace and security of French training - the Opera's ballet school
produces superb talent year after year - and the technical and artistic
assurance that the Opera engenders in its dancers.
The style is Franco-Italian, brilliant in beaten steps and turns, stylish
and sophisticated as to feet - the girls have virtues in point-work
undreamed of by British teaching. There is nothing unemphatic or unduly
modest about what we see, and no English Missery (I'm tempted to write
'English misery'). The young are there on stage because they want to
succeed; failings have to do with a desire for public approval: but
regardez-moi is not the worst of mottos. Lyricism is at a premium - a famous
dancer described it to me as 'dancing too slowly' - while that grandeur of
scale and phrasing we admire with Russian training is largely absent.
But in matter of polish, of physical wit and clarity - the language fast,
light, quickly accented - the Jeunes danseurs are a delight. I loved the
sextet from Napoli, done with southern vivacity, and was charmed by Sandrine
Henault's exquisite feet in the Flower Festival in Genzano duet: every step
was diamond-cut. Her partner was Eric Camillo, buoyant, beautifully sure,
and playing with real charm. Equally fine Bertrand Belem, who sizzled
through devilish solos in La Vivandiere, and Paquita, and Gil Isoart as
James in the second act of La Sylphide. Why, conscience asks, cannot our
young Royal Ballet aspirants do as well?
The Opera's other young virtuoso is Emmanuel Thibault. I reported on him
last year. Slight in build, he has a technique which dazzles by its easy
elegance as by its prowess. In the Napoli pas, and then in a fragment from
Le Papillon, he showed a phenomenal facility - a circuit of the stage
interspersing racing leaps with tight, clear pirouettes was astonishing. He
is teacher's pet, seemingly able to do with grace whatever he is asked, and
unspoiled and gentle in manner. He comes to life as he dances: curtain calls
suggest a young man almost shy of applause.
He was partnered in Le Papillon by Veronique Doisneau, ideally matched with
him in lightness, speed, and a sweet fragility, her dancing as effortless
and beguiling as his. Very pretty, too, the sylphide sketched by Miteki
Kudo, leading her James through the glens of Bournonville's second act, and
turning and posing with delicious innocence. Grandly soaring was Sandrine
Marache, who bounded proudly through a Vivandiere solo. My only complaint
about the performance is the fact that Anton Dolin's version of the Pas de
Quatre in which four divinities of London's ballet in 1845 were brought
together in a contest of charm and steely temperament, was lightly guyed.
The steps, like the Pugni score, are pretty, and need to be prettily danced.
The mock rivalries, and the mopping and mowing between Saturday's
participants, was all too roguey-poguey. Real-life tensions among ballerinas
who have incarnated their great predecessors have been more subtly masked
and far deadlier than this warfare of pink tulle and moues.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Lasagne recipe for soil
renewal - A new technique for salvaging contaminated land is being tested in
the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A novel approach to one of the US's most common but most intractable
environmental problems is being tested by a team of scientists at a US
federal uranium-processing facility in Kentucky.
The field test has nothing to do with radioactive waste or nuclear safety,
however. The scientists are seeking a process for cleaning up leaked fuel,
industrial solvents and other substances that have contaminated the soil at
thousands of sites in the US. The technology raises new hope that many of
these areas of land can return to productive use. It also promises to speed
up the faltering 14-year effort to clean up the worst of the areas.
'One of the things that has hampered progress is a slow pace of
technological innovation,' says Bill Roberts, a toxic waste expert at the
Environmental Defence Fund, a private lobbying group. Of the 1,200 to 1,300
sites designated as the most dangerous under the Superfund programme, set up
in 1980 by the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
clean up contaminated land, about 200 have been reclaimed so far.
The new technique, known as the lasagne process, involves using electrical
current to draw wastes through 'treatment zones' in the soil. Toxic waste
materials can often be rendered harmless in the zones, which resemble the
layers of a lasagne, without being brought to the surface. Scientists say
the process is effective in densely packed soils that are nearly impossible
to reclaim with current techniques. It may also prove cheaper and safer.
As part of a wider initiative announced in January by the EPA, the project
highlights the Clinton administration's policy of encouraging co-operation
between the public and private sectors and among rival companies in the
fight against pollution. Three big US industrial groups, Monsanto, DuPont
and General Electric, have taken leading roles in the project, together with
the EPA and the Department of Energy.
'The common denominator of the primary collaborators was that we each had
difficult and expensive soil clean-up problems to deal with and were
frustrated by the lack of cost-effective technology to do the job,' says
Philip Brodsky, director of corporate research and environmental technology
at Monsanto, the big US chemical group. 'The EPA's willingness to play a
matchmaker role was critical in getting the process rolling.'
Soil remediation lends itself to joint research and development. 'There are
economies of scale that come into play here,' Roberts says. 'There is no
long-term return in a company investing in this kind of new technology by
itself.'
The effectiveness of the lasagne process has yet to be demonstrated,
however, with testing so far limited to small-scale trials. The Kentucky
site where its evaluation begins this spring was chosen because it is
typical. In an isolated storage area at the facility, the solvent
trichloro-ethylene, widely used as a paint-stripper, has penetrated the
dense soil. The EPA says it will be 'a couple of years' before comparisons
of the process's cost and efficacy can be made.
Currently, the main approach to dealing with contaminated land is to
excavate the toxic material and either incinerate it or seal it in
watertight pits. However, toxic substances, leaking from ruptured tanks, for
example, may spread deep below the surface. The expense is also prohibitive,
and the risk of human exposure is great.
If the contamination is deep, but the soil is relatively permeable, wastes
may have collected in ground water, which can be pumped to the surface and
neutralised. But in soils with impermeable clay layers, so-called 'pump and
treat' methods are ineffective. Residual contamination usually infiltrates
fissures in the hard clay below the ground water and eventually seeps back
in.
The lasagne process may provide a solution in such cases. Brodsky, who
initiated the project, says various geological conditions are present in
most sites and it is impossible to pinpoint which may be suitable for the
lasagne treatment. But the technology may contribute to an overall solution
in a substantial proportion of them.
Brodsky's idea was to combine three existing technologies.
First, a process called electro-osmosis flushes the contaminants out of the
clay fissures. A cathode is inserted into the ground, which emits
low-voltage electrical current that pulls the positive ions in the waste
droplets at the rate of about once inch a day.
Second, a series of 'treatment zones' - the lasagne's layers - are carved in
the soil. The top and bottom strata are filled with an electrical conductor,
such as graphite. Waste gathers in the middle layers when the current is
switched on.
The third step deals with the contaminated material once it is there. Often,
catalysts are available to help convert hazardous compounds to benign
substances once inside the treatment zones. Alternatively, 'bioremediation'
systems to degrade the waste organically are being developed by a number of
companies, including Monsanto, DuPont and GE. Another option, used in the
Kentucky test, is to put activated carbon in the treatment zones to absorb
the contaminants.
The new technology has surfaced at a propitious time. Last month, the EPA
proposed sweeping revisions of the Superfund law, following widespread
perception that it has failed to achieve many of its goals.
Among its proposals, the EPA would ease standards for cleaning up some
Superfund sites in an effort to encourage redevelopment of abandoned land.
More importantly, the new accent on flexibility is likely to spill over into
state and federal rules applying to cleaning up the thousands of waste sites
not covered by the Superfund programme.
Even if the lasagne project fails, Brodsky believes the joint effort will
continue. 'The collaborative paradigm has already proved very productive,'
he says, citing advances in bioremediation, soil flushing and other areas.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Big boys' game comes under
fire - Germany's national recycling scheme faces growing attack / Worldwide
Waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wuppertal, a smoky town in the recession-hit coal mining region of northern
Germany, is hardly inspiring. But for Ernst von Weizsacker, one of Germany's
most prominent environmentalists, this is just the place for an institute
devoted to the fight against pollution.
Von Weizsacker, of the Wuppertal Institute for Climatology, recently
announced that he was retiring as president of the advisory council of
Duales System Deutschland (DSD), Germany's three-year-old national recycling
scheme.
Von Weizsacker calls Germany's most ambitious environmental project a
'dangerous manipulation' which 'serves the throw-away society'. He has
joined the swelling chorus of critics who claim that the waste disposal
scheme is misconceived.
Von Weizsacker's criticism is directed at the monopolistic structure that
characterises DSD and makes the country's recycling industry increasingly
concentrated in the hands of a few utilities and energy groups.
DSD was created in 1991 by 600 companies in response to the packaging law
drawn up by Klaus Topfer, the environment minister. This makes manufacturers
and retailers responsible for collection and recycling of packaging waste.
It also sets collection and recycling quotas, which increase over time and
must be enforced nationally.
Industrial groups in Germany set up DSD as a national waste collection
scheme, which signed contracts with waste recyclers. To meet the cost of
collection, DSD imposes a fee, borne mostly by consumers through higher
prices and shown as a green dot on packaging.
Because the law insisted the system should be nationwide, DSD quickly spread
to nearly all German cities. Few German households are without the special
yellow bins for packaging waste with green dots.
Three years after its creation, DSD's quasi-monopoly has angered
middle-sized German recyclers and environmentalists who say the giant waste
collector is squeezing out of a profitable market the small players who
represent a pool of innovation for new environmentally friendly recycling
technologies.
The Federal Cartel Office has admitted there is a problem but argues that
DSD is only fulfilling the packaging law. Undaunted, the medium-sized
companies are intensifying their lobbying efforts within government circles.
They point out that in 1992, more than 140 waste management companies were
acquired by larger groups, compared with 60 in 1990.
The medium-sized companies are also protesting against 10-year contracts
signed by DSD with municipalities and with the large utilities and energy
groups. 'Innovation and market strategies for recycling specific waste
products no longer have a chance,' explains the federal association of
medium-sized companies (BVMW). The association is proposing continuous
tender processes and price negotiations, which would allow them to bid for
DSD contracts. They add that such measures would also open the market to
foreign competition.
Waste disposal companies created by municipalities now make up one in three
of DSD's clients. 'Municipalities immediately saw a tremendous source of
revenue in this business and made sure the contracts did not escape them,'
says Franz-Josef Fraundorfer, managing director in the German office of
Arthur D Little, the consultancy group.
Large utilities and energy groups have also moved into waste recycling. RWE
Entsorgung, the waste management subsidiary of RWE, Germany's biggest
utility group, has a turnover of more than DM2bn (Pounds 700m). Three years
old, it has acquired 100 companies in its expansion drive, and DSD accounts
for 15 per cent of its business.
Other German concerns have also stepped in, with Veba, the Dusseldorf-based
energy group, processing 120,000 tonnes of plastics in a recycling plant
linked to its oil refinery in Bottrop. And Thyssen Handelsunion, a
subsidiary of Thyssen, the big engineering and steel group, is involved in
building up recycling plants in eastern Germany.
These groups argue that the future of waste disposal in Germany lies with
those who can invest large sums in complicated recycling plants. High
investments also justify long-term contracts, DSD officials say.
According to the Environmental Council, an advisory body to the federal
states, four or five companies are likely to share some 40 per cent of the
domestic waste market in coming years.
DSD says the concentration process in the industry had started before it
came into being,
but medium-sized companies claim the DSD's structure favours large
companies. 'DSD is dominated by companies such as Unilever and Procter 
Gamble who have no interest in meddling with the small players. It is a big
boys' game,' says one entrepreneur.
Meanwhile, the government has ignored critics from the smaller companies.
Topfer says his packaging law achieved a 13 per cent drop in packaging waste
in Germany in 1993.

FT  16 MAR 94 / People: NatWest's newest customer runs the bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before taking up his role in the new post of finance director for
National Westminster's UK branch business, Paul Biddle has a related task to
perform: to become a NatWest customer himself.
In moving from being finance director for Digital Equipment, the computer
group, Biddle sees himself becoming a NatWest bank customer but not a
banker.
He says that he regards 'the business I'm joining as fundamentally a
retailing business - it just happens to be financial products they're
selling'.
He believes his new job - which he takes up in mid-April - will enable him
to draw on his experience in industry.
He has worked for Unilever and Rank Xerox, following his training as a
chartered accountant.
The priority he sees for the years ahead will be to find the right balance
of ways of distributing products to customers, through electronic and
telephone banking, as well as the traditional branch network.
Martin Gray, chief executive of NatWest's UK branch banking, said that
Biddle's responsibilities would include developing and setting the financial
strategy for retail banking operations; managing the budget planning; and
liaising with other parts of the group on long and short-term financial
strategies.
In creating this new role is NatWest implying it may have missed out in the
past, through not having a finance director for the UK branch business?
Biddle says only that he suspects they have not put in place the appropriate
management processes - such as planning and budgeting - which are 'almost
taken for granted in the industrial environment'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Perlin leaves Sears and goes shopping for himself
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House-cleaning continues at the top of Sears with the resignation of Howard
Perlin, the director in charge of acquisitions and disposals; he has been on
the board since 1984.
Perlin started seven years before that as personal assistant to Geoffrey
Maitland Smith, then chief executive and now chairman.
Perlin, 47, says that, having masterminded the disposal of Satellite
Information Services last month, he has brought the group to 'where it wants
to get, for the moment', with the business focused on retailing and home
shopping.
Since Liam Strong came in as chief executive in early 1992, there has been a
rapid turnover of executive directors. Aside from Roger Groom, who came on
to the board in 1991, Perlin was the only executive director who remained
from the pre-Strong era. Strong's own difficulties in changing the culture
at Sears were illustrated towards the end of last year when Stephen Park,
the finance director he had brought in from Hanson just 16 months
previously, resigned.
Perlin, who joined Sears from First National Finance Corporation, reckons he
has 'probably gathered more experience than most merchant bankers, having
completed approaching 100 transactions, including 30 MBOs' in his time with
the group. Disposals in which he had a hand included William Hill and Asprey
and he was also involved in the acquisition of Freemans.
He now plans to put this to good use by setting up his own private
consultancy - very much a one-man-band - with the aim of providing corporate
finance and business strategy advice across a range of industries. He is
also building up a portfolio of non-executive directorships, and has one

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Wheatley, a former senior London partner of Price Waterhouse, has been
appointed a non-executive director and deputy chairman of Ashtead group, the
fast-growing plant hire company.
Ashtead, which began as a Pounds 458,000 management buy-out ten years ago,
was floated on the unlisted securities market in November 1986 and was the
last winner of the USM company of the year award. Its market capitalisation
has risen from Pounds 8m to Pounds 127m and pre-tax profits have jumped from
Pounds 533,000 to around Pounds 5.2m in the current year, according to some
stock market estimates.
Chairman Peter Lewis, 53, who founded the company with managing director
George Burnett, 46, says that the company has grown to a stage where it
needs a non-executive director with 'bigger company experience'. Wheatley,
55, who stepped down as chairman of 3i last year, is a non-executive
director of NM Rothschild, British Steel, Forte and Legal  General.

FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Carlton adjusts its managerial contrast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Communications moved yesterday to integrate the management structure
of its ITV operations following its recent acquisition of Central
Independent Television.
Andy Allan, right, managing director of Central, is to become chief
executive of Carlton UK Television from mid-April. A new managing director
of Central Television, yet to be appointed, will report to Allan, who will
also be responsible for the sales operation of the two ITV franchises, the
largest in the ITV network.
Allan, 51, has worked in broadcasting for nearly 30 years, beginning as a
presenter and producer and later becoming a programme editor in the light
entertainment department of ABC television. He is a former head of news at
Thames Television and joined Central as director of programmes in 1984 from
Tyne Tees Television, where he had been director of programmes and deputy
managing director. He is also a governor of the National Film and Television
School
Nigel Walmsley, the present chief executive of Carlton Television and an
administrator rather than a programme-maker, will move to the headquarters
of Carlton Communications as the main board director, with overall
responsibility for group broadcasting.
Both Carlton Television and Central will continue to operate under separate
boards, as part of the terms of their broadcasting licences.
'The opportunity to take responsibility for ITV's two largest broadcasters
is irresistible,' says Allan. Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Association
for the next two years, remains chairman of Central.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Management: Seven strategies to change your company - There
is more than one way to tackle organisational upheaval. Adrian Furnham
considers the options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with the idea and practice of organisational change is that it
is both boring and anxiety provoking. The number of magazine and newspaper
articles, courses, memos and self-help books dealing with change is
overwhelming.
'Adapt or die; change or decay' is not a simple rallying cry for the senior
manager, it is a reality. But the question is how to bring about successful
change to maximise effectiveness and minimise pain.
Managers choose different strategies with varying consequences.
The fellowship strategy: This approach relies heavily on interpersonal
relations, using seminars, dinners and events to announce and discuss what
needs to be changed and how. People at all levels are listened to,
supposedly treated equally and conflicting opinions are expressed. This
'warm and fuzzy' approach emphasises personal commitment over ideas - the
change process may have serious problems getting going as a consequence.
Because this strategy is averse to conflict it can miss crucial issues and
even waste time. Many fellowship-types leave the organisation and can only
be replaced by those who have a need to belong.
The political strategy: Here the power structure is targeted by attempting
to influence the official and unofficial leaders. The strategy seeks to
identify and persuade those in the organisation who are most respected and
who have large constituencies. Political strategists flatter, bargain and
compromise to achieve their ends. But this de-stabilises the organisation
because of ongoing shifts in people's political stances. Maintaining
credibility can be difficult because the strategy is so obviously devious.
Getting people to show their true colours in this way is never simple.
The economic strategy: The cynical economist believes that money is the best
persuader. The person who controls the purse strings can buy or change
anything. Everybody has a price. This is the rational 'homo-economicus'
approach that assumes people act more or less logically but that their logic
is based on economic motives. But 'buying people off' can be costly and the
effects short-term. The strategy also ignores emotional issues and all
questions besides bottom-line profit.
The academic strategy: This approach assumes that if you present people with
enough information and the correct facts they will accept the need to
change. The academic strategist commissions studies and reports from
employees, experts and consultants. Although such strategists are happy to
share their findings it is difficult to mobilise energy and resources after
the analysis phase. Analysis paralysis often results because the study phase
lasts too long and the results and recommendations are frequently out of
date when they are published.
The engineering strategy: This is the technocratic approach that assumes
that if the physical nature of a job is changed, enough people will be
forced to change. The strong emphasis on the structural aspects of problems
leads to a sensitivity to the environment which is particularly helpful in
unstable situations. The concern over channels of communication can prompt
structural change, but fails to commit most people. Most people do not like
being treated as machines and hence do not feel committed. Such change can
also break up happy and efficient teams. The strategy is limited because
only high-level managers can really understand it, it is impersonal and it
ignores the question: What is in this for me?
The military strategy: This approach is reliant on brute force and sometimes
ignorance. It is at times used by the military and the police, students,
pressure groups and political parties. The emphasis is on learning to use
the weapons for the fight. Physical strength and agility are required and
following the plan is rewarded. But the change-enforcer cannot relax, in
case the imposed change disappears. Furthermore, force is met by force and
the result is ever-escalating violence.
The confrontational strategy: This high-risk strategy reckons that if you
can arouse and then mobilise anger in people to confront the problem, they
will change. Much depends on the strategists' ability to argue the points,
as well as being able to stir up anger without promoting violence. This
approach encourages people to confront problems they would prefer not to
address but tends to focus too much on the problem and not on the solution.
Anger and conflict tend to polarise people and can cause a backlash.
Few of these strategies occur in isolation. But they do have different basic
assumptions about who to influence, how to proceed and what to focus on.
Each tends to be effective at addressing certain change problems but very
bad at dealing with others. The political strategy has problems with
credibility; the economic approach with maintaining change, and the academic
with implementing findings. But for the professional who must demonstrate
his worth to the organisation by implementing change, any of the above might
help him.
The trouble is that strategies tend to be chosen by chief executives for
personal reasons rather than as a result of any well-considered set of
options. An inappropriate strategy may cause more trouble than the initial
reason for change.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Management: The power to choose - How companies can now
control electricity costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Smith, buyer of utilities at the McDonald's fast food chain, is
beaming at a chart of one restaurant's electricity consumption. He likes the
power it gives the company's restaurant managers.
'Look at that,' he says. 'They've done all the right things there. The
consumption falls when it should; the store workers have switched off the
cookers and lights when they do not need them. It's a perfect example to
show to other stores.'
The chart comes courtesy of Eastern Electricity which, from next month, is
to supply power and associated services, including diagrams showing past
consumption, to 500 McDonald's stores in England and Wales.
Eastern's willingness to supply power and other facilities as part of the
service, yet still undercut offers from rival power companies, was one
reason why it won the business.
In the past few months throughout Britain big companies like McDonald's have
been evaluating for the first time a range of offers for power supplies as
they and the suppliers gear up for the next phase in the liberalisation of
the market.
From April 1 any electricity consumer using more than 100 kilowatt hours at
the peak of its demand will be able to buy its supplies from any registered
supplier including the 14 mainland UK distributors and the two England and
Wales generators. Until now they have had to buy power from their local
distributor.
The previous limit of 1 megawatt, 10 times the new threshold, encompassed
only about 5,000 consumers. From April about 50,000, including businesses,
schools, hospitals and leisure centres, will be able to shop around and many
are taking advantage.
More than 7,000 in the 100kW to 1MW market, a fifth of those eligible, have
already made arrangements to take their supplies from a company other than
their regional electricity supplier. The industry expects the figure to
reach about 15,000 within the next year.
Price cuts have reached 20 per cent for a handful but the majority which
have switched are estimated to be making annual savings on their electricity
bills of between 4 and 10 per cent. Many of those which have stayed with
their regional distributor have also gained financially.
But the benefits of the liberalised market are not just in the price.
Companies, or at any rate the large ones, are finding they are in strong
position to demand a tailor-made service which can improve their energy
management.
As a large company, with all the advantages which that brings for bulk
buying, McDonald's was better placed than most prospective buyers - yet it
received offers for the whole country from just four suppliers of the 14
approached.
Smith was impressed by only one company other than Eastern. 'It was apparent
that several suppliers were poorly prepared. There was not the expertise to
deal with the market. One company, for example, had a very good salesman but
poor back-up.
'Several of the offers we received had hidden costs,' says Smith. Some were
able to offer charts showing consumption in each store by the half hour but
they wanted to charge extra, on top of the prices they had quoted, and that
was already more than Eastern's quote.
Smith says McDonald's has become much more conscious of energy costs in the
past two years and now sees the half-hourly breakdown of consumption as an
essential management tool. 'It gives the manager of a store a picture of
what has been happening in the store even at times when he is not there.'
McDonald's estimates that it will save Pounds 1.4m on its energy bill each
year as a result of the deal with Eastern, which is worth about Pounds 18m.
A separate deal in Scotland for the company's 20 stores there is leading to
savings of more than 30 per cent.
Another company taking advantage of the newly competitive UK electricity
market is Stakis, the hotels and casinos group. Stakis will make significant
savings on its electricity bill after a deal with Scottish Hydro-Electric
involving the 25 of its 52 hotels and six casinos which are big enough to be
able to shop around for supplies. It expects its Pounds 2.3m-a-year
electricity bill for the 31 units in the Hydro deal to fall by about Pounds
250,000. Like McDonald's, Stakis was not spoiled for choice. Bill Gunn, in
charge of utilities purchasing for the group, says only the two Scottish
power distribution companies were prepared to make an offer covering hotels
throughout the UK.
Stakis's main requirement was simplicity. 'Electricity bills seem to us to
be far too complicated with different charges for maximum demand, for supply
and for different times of the day. We wanted a uniform price for each unit
of electricity which is the same for all hotels and for that price to
include everything.
'We have limited resources and a single price makes billing far easier to
double check. It is also useful for comparison purposes. If one hotel is
using far more units than another with similar occupancy rates we will know
there is something wrong. Perhaps they leave everything on in the kitchen
overnight.'
Both Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power were able to meet Stakis's request
for uniform prices but Hydro's tender was lower.
Not all companies, however, have found it easy to shop around. At Fowler 
Holden, John Hardy, managing director, badgered electricity suppliers for
several months before he received an offer he considered may be acceptable.
'At first I could not get suppliers to compete,' he says. 'They seemed only
interested in making decent offers to large companies. But large companies
are my competitors and if they are getting big cuts in their electricity
bills I want them too.'
The first six offers made to Fowler would have resulted in its power bill
remaining at about Pounds 26,000 a year. It was only this week when one
company, Powerline, the Midlands Electricity subsidiary, revised an earlier
proposed deal to produce annual savings of about Pounds 2,000.
The lateness of the proposed offer means Fowler will be unable to change
supplier until after April 1, since the electricity authorities need 20
working days' notice. Hardy says the delay has been worthwhile. 'Unless we
had been prepared to wait, the introduction of competition would have meant
virtually nothing to us.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Recruitment: The permanent temp is a Handyman - As a new
style of organisation emerges from the recession, companies are turning to
temporary managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How hard do you need to work at getting a job? Most people have heard of
aspirants firing off scores of applications and of advertisements attracting
hundreds of inquiries, even for quite lowly posts.
There is nothing unusual about the committed job seeker, but the trend
towards more flexible workforces and slimmer companies is influencing
individual approaches to employment.
Richard McKeown has gone one step further than chasing every vacancy,
turning his skills as a chartered secretary into an aggressively marketed
business service aimed at short-term employment opportunities. McKeown, 46,
who lives in Uxbridge, west London, was made redundant in 1987 after the
company he worked for moved to south Wales and he decided not to go with it.
He invested Pounds 7,000 with an outplacement agency which did not find him
a job but which gave him valuable advice about interviews and how to write a
CV.
Since 1988 he has had a series of temporary contracts in the company
secretarial role and is now completing a short stint as a temporary
assistant company secretary at Kingfisher.
McKeown's name is registered with three recruitment agencies but he has gone
beyond being merely a hopeful job applicant. He spends Pounds 5,000 a year
on marketing himself. This includes employing a public relations expert.
He produces a glossy brochure advertising his skills, experience, previous
employers, selected references and the work he is capable of doing. He is,
in his own words, 'the all singing, all dancing one-man band'.
McKeown may be the manager of the future; the sort of individual whom
management philosopher Charles Handy, writes about in his new book, The
Empty Raincoat.
Handy talks about a portfolio approach to life where you decide how much you
want to work, how you want to work and where you want to work. Newly
restructured organisations, he has observed, are moving increasingly towards
the employment of fee-charging professionals.
A whole new employment industry has sprung up over the past 10-15 years to
provide temporary - or 'interim' - managers.
Many do not see themselves as temporary workers in the long term but are
prepared to fulfil such roles until a permanent post comes along. McKeown
claims to have 'crossed the Rubicon' in this respect and now sees himself as
a permanent temp.
He says he does not feel insecure, has never been despairing and is relaxed
about his prospects. His experience as an itinerant employee is growing. His
former clients include BTR, Lautro and Mercury Communications.
The use of temporary staff started in Silicon Valley in the US among
start-up companies. They employed a core of essential staff on a permanent
basis and made up the rest of their workforce with temporary contractors.
Now the strategy is spreading to individual managers.
McKeown argues that it can be good for professionals because they can
command higher fees than they would get on a salaried basis. It can be good
for the company because it is buying a short-term and often essential stop
gap at a fixed price. The downside for the employer would seem to be cost
and, to some extent, uncertainty about quality, although the temporary
nature of the employment lessens the potential damage of recruiting a dud.
Jeff Grout, managing director of Robert Half, which has about 500 temporary
accountants on its books, says: 'As companies have come out of the recession
they are not rushing to recruit staff back on a permanent basis.
'The traditional temp has changed dramatically. It used to be in low-level
grades but there are now some very senior people doing it.'
Charles Russam, managing director of the GMS consultancy and secretary of
the Association of Temporary and Interim Executive Services, says his
company database lists 3,500 executives to supply companies that need senior
business managers at director level or one level below.
He estimates the executive leasing or interim management sector is worth
between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m in the UK and that it is growing at about
20 per cent a year as it is increasingly viewed as a serious alternative to
long-term employees. He says: 'Interim management is no longer being seen as
the recycling of clapped out executives but as a credible option for
business.
'Businesses are saying to themselves why do I need to keep such people on my
payroll when I can go into the market and get someone in to do a specific
job.'
But how do you avoid getting a useless manager attempting to revive a
washed-up career? Russam admits that such people have found their way on to
agency books. His own company, he says, will no longer list anyone for whom
it does not have three satisfactory references.
As registered employment agencies, such companies take their fees from
employers. 'It means that we owe a duty of care to our clients so it is in
our interests to ensure that the people we are supplying are of a good
calibre,' says Russam.
Interest in temporary managers is growing, he says, among expanding small
businesses which need hands-on management help, often on a part-time basis.
Use of the temporary professional has expanded markedly in the field of
information technology. About 20,000 to 30,000 freelance employees are
working in this area in the UK, with about 20 agencies marketing their
services. The biggest operator, CSS-Comac, has about 1,100 people working.
Tony Coombes, professional services director of Systems Resources of
Coventry, which has about 500 contract staff working for employers such as
IBM, says quality control is becoming increasingly important as customer
companies are demanding good people and consistency from suppliers.
'Everyone we place is an ambassador of the company. If they don't do well,
manufacturers will blame us,' he says.
The company has become rigorous with its contractors. All conversations with
freelances discussing their abilities are recorded afterwards and kept on
file. 'It may appear big brotherish but it's not. It is really a way of
making a quality selection against the requirement the client gives us,'
Coombes says.
Contracts tend to be for three months. Employees do not have the holiday
arrangements that their full-time colleagues enjoy but the trade-off in job
security tends to be higher salaries. Computer operators in the Pounds
15,000 to Pounds 20,000 salary range may find themselves earning the
equivalent of between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 28,000 a week for the
duration of the contract. Experienced programmers will be earning the
equivalent of Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 45,000 a year compared with Pounds
20,000 to Pounds 30,000 in a full-time post.
Richard McKeown agrees that the fees commanded by temporary professionals
are higher than full-time salaries. The fee, he says, has to account for
personal overheads, self-provision of pensions, holidays and car. He also
feels justified in including an additional element to reflect his
availability at short notice.
One of the biggest problems for individuals, he argues, is adopting the
frame of mind that accepts temporary contract working as the norm. To do
this, he believes it is necessary to build up capital that can be used as a
buffer for the times when demand is quiet.
He says: 'There is a vast pool of highly qualified people out there. They
might have come to to it through redundancy, but so what? I think I'm better
at my job now than I was 10 years ago. It has been a positive experience.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Benefit split could lift women's income
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Social security reforms could raise women's incomes at little cost to the
Exchequer and without discouraging women from taking up work, the Institute
for Fiscal Studies, the independent think-tank, says in a study published
yesterday.
The study, conducted for the Equal Opportunities Commission, examines
several proposals. It estimates that one proposal, splitting income support
payments equally between partners, would not increase government spending on
benefits but would give two-thirds of women with children in unemployed
couples a gain of more than Pounds 10 a week.
IFS programme director Mr Steven Webb said: 'Our research shows that
carefully constructed reforms can increase women's financial independence
and have little disincentive effects on part-time work.'
But the study warns against simply increasing social security benefits. It
says that introducing a new 'non-worker's benefit', for example, of Pounds
25 per week for all individuals including married women not in paid
employment would cost up to Pounds 7bn and encourage some women to give up
their existing low-paid part-time work.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Tourism body calls for wind farm curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restrictions on wind farms are backed by the Wales Tourist Board today in a
strategy for tourism in the principality, Roland Adburgham writes.
Wind farms, which use turbines to harness the wind and provide an
alternative source of energy, face increasing opposition from Welsh local
authorities and residents concerned about visual intrusion and noise of the
turbines.
In its Tourism 2000 strategy document - to be launched today by Mr John
Redwood, Welsh secretary - the board says: 'The quality of Wales's natural
environment is one of the industry's greatest assets.
'Tourism 2000 recognises the need to conserve and enhance that environment
and is concerned about threats which might impact upon the industry, for
example wind farms.' It endorses the policies of the Countryside Council for
Wales, which opposes wind farms in national parks and other special areas.
Wales has eight wind farms and planning consent is being sought for many
more.
The board hopes its strategy will create 10,000 jobs and increase tourism
earnings by Pounds 700m by 2000. Tourism now contributes Pounds 1.3bn, or 6
per cent, of gross domestic product.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Best-selling trust to suffer yield cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group offering a 10 per cent return on its best-selling trust has warned
70,000 investors that it will cut the yield to 9 per cent from June 28.
The high-income unit trust offered by fund manager Foreign  Colonial has
pulled in more than Pounds 500m since its launch just over a year ago.
It was particularly attractive to income seekers and heavily promoted by
many financial intermediaries because of the 10 per cent yield.
Such funds, which obtain an unusually high income, have been highly
controversial because they can procure such high returns only at the expense
of the capital growth prospects. Many experts believe savers' capital could
actually be eroded in order to keep the income flowing.
Over the past year, anyone investing in the FC fund would have lost roughly
10 per cent of their initial investment - neatly cancelling out the benefit
of the 10 per cent income. Most conventional equity income funds have
produced a significantly better return.
Mr Simon James, FC director, said the decision to cut the target yield on
the fund was mainly because the group expects interest rates to move lower
this year. He added that the group also wants to give investors plenty of
notice of the impending cut in yield.
FC has also trimmed its management charge from 1.5 per cent to 1.25 per
cent with effect from April 6.
Rival fund manager Morgan Grenfell, whose high income trust closely
resembles the FC fund, said it had no intention of reducing the 10 per cent
yield on its fund, or of cutting its 1.5 per cent management charge. The
Morgan Grenfell fund, launched last September, has so far attracted around
Pounds 40m. The Morgan Grenfell fund has also lost value since its launch:
investors who bought at 25p a unit would get back Pounds 23.52p at last
night's prices.
Save  Prosper, another leading fund management group, cancelled its plans
for a similar fund last December. It argued then that the chances of capital
erosion were unacceptably high. This week Mr Ken Emery, Save and Prosper
technical director, said: 'It looks as if our concerns are being confirmed,
although it is obviously too early for judgment to be passed.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Design Council to axe 75% of staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Design Council, the government-funded body which provides design
services to industry, is to cut its staff from 200 to 50, close its five
regional offices and transfer many of its industrial functions to the
national network of one-stop business service centres known as Business
Links.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the council was
'out of keeping' with the government's aim to bring services to businesses
on a local level and announced yesterday that Pounds 6m was to be
ring-fenced over the next three years for the promotion of design through
the Business Links.
It is also understood that the Design Council's budget could be reduced from
about Pounds 7.5m a year to just under Pounds 4m beginning in 1995.
The announcement follows a four-month review led by the Design Council's
chairman, Mr John Sorrell, a designer and former chairman of the Design
Business Association.
The council will cease to provide services, many of which will pass to the
private sector. Instead, says a review document published yesterday, the
council will become 'an organisation with the attitude and capacity to
inspire and orchestrate action by others'.
The council will advise and monitor the 200 planned Business Links, which
will bring together the functions of Training and Enterprise Councils,
chambers of commerce, local authorities and the Enterprise Agency.
Mr Heseltine said that the regional Business Links would be better able to
cater for those small businesses which would not 'naturally find their way'
to the Haymarket offices of the council.
The restructured council, intended for relaunch in a December, its 50th
anniversary, will continue to act as the UK's authority on design. It will
also conduct research and develop design education and training.
Mr Sorrell said yesterday that the refocused council would build on the best
of the past. 'We are creating a new council which is smaller and will be
very fleet of foot,' he said.
The council is still in its consultation period on staff decisions, but
hopes to redeploy some of its central office workers into the private sector
or into Business Links. It is not yet known how many will be made redundant.
Mr Harminder Sing, regional officer for MSF, the union for the council's
workers, said: 'Our major concern is that the expertise that the Design
Council has built up is being dispersed. If it is fragmented then you lose
the benefits of one unit - the synergy, the effectiveness, and the
cross-fertilisation of ideas.'
The Confederation of British Industry and the Chartered Society of Designers
welcomed the review's conclusions yesterday, though both expressed
reservations about the details of passing on industrial services to Business
Links.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Tea Time sells for Pounds 100,050
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A painting of a mother and child by the American Impressionist Karl Buehr
sold for Pounds 100,050 at Phillips in London yesterday. 'Tea Time' had been
estimated at Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,000 but aroused considerable interest,
with 10 telephone bidders.
It eventually went to the New York dealer James Berry Hill. Buehr worked in
Giverny in France in the early 20th century and his last work at auction,
offered at Chicago last year, sold for just Pounds 559.
At Christie's an auction of more than 200 pictures of birds was 89 per cent
sold by value. However an important painting by the leading bird artist,
Archibald Thorburn, of 'European Mallard and Teal in Winter', went below
estimate for Pounds 24,150.
The art market is picking up after a long recession when sellers were
reluctant to offer works for auction. Among the stronger sectors is
furniture, and in New York at the weekend Sotheby's sold an English
marquetry side cabinet for Dollars 184,380 (Pounds 122,500), double its
estimate.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Manx VAT is cut to boost tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Value added tax is to be cut on some tourism-related services in the Isle of
Man in a bid to boost the industry, Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury
minister, said yesterday.
Presenting the island's 1994 budget, Mr Gelling also announced a six-month
penalty and interest remission scheme from April 6 for those with income tax
and VAT liabilities relating to income omitted or understated in
declarations since April 1987.
The treasury hopes the amnesty, designed to enable people and companies to
regularise their liabilities without incurring penalties or interest
charges, will produce several million pounds of estimated outstanding tax
debts.
Mr Gelling insisted that the lower VAT rate, levied after negotiations with
the UK, would not apply to goods that could be exported to the UK mainland.
The Manx treasury is believed to be considering levying the lower rate on
hotel accommodation and restaurant meals.
The Isle of Man, a Crown dependency with its own parliament, the Tynwald,
has a customs and excise agreement with the UK under which VAT is levied at
the same rates and on the same items as in the UK. The amount raised is
passed to the UK and the Isle of Man receives a rebate calculated on its
population.
Mr Gelling said yesterday: 'I have been able to agree (with the UK) a degree
of flexibility on some tourist-related non-exportable services. Our
objective is to ensure that this hard-won flexibility is best used to
stimulate economic activity and growth.'
He said he hoped to finalise details before the end of the summer to allow
the island's flagging tourist industry time to prepare adjusted price levels
for next year.
Mr Gelling said the recession on the island had bottomed out. 'Company and
VAT registrations are up and there is increased economic activity.'
Net expenditure for the coming year is estimated at Pounds 200.5m, to be
balanced by income of Pounds 193.7m and Pounds 7.66m of unspent capital
brought forward from last year. This year's capital expenditure programme is
Pounds 42.61m, and the island's reserve fund will be maintained at Pounds
66.51m.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Sidelined by static income and narrowing remit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Design Council was established by Winston Churchill's wartime government
in 1944 as the Council of Industrial Design, with a remit for 'the
advancement of British industry by the improvement of the design of its
products'.
This was to be accomplished by encouraging industry and commerce to
understand the positive effect good design can have on market performance.
For 40 years the remit was interpreted by the council and the Department of
Trade and Industry, its sponsoring department, as covering the need to
educate the public, as well as industry and commerce.
To the public the council became best known for its shop in London's
Haymarket and the triangular label it awarded to selected consumer products
which met a wide range of criteria for good design. This helped earn the
council a high public profile, especially during the 1970s, although the
organisation's impact on the quality of design in industry remained
questionable until the early 1980s.
From the mid 1980s, the council's government grant came under growing
pressure in spite of the declared passion for design of Baroness Thatcher,
who was then prime minister. In 1988 the council responded to this pressure
by dropping most of its public-awareness activities in agreement with the
DTI. The shop was closed and the label dropped.
The council continued to provide design teaching materials and advice to
schools, but focused most of its activities on services to industry and
commerce. To reach small and medium-sized companies more effectively, its
network of regional offices was also strengthened.
The council's refocusing of activities was intended to make better use of
its annual grant and DTI income, which have remained roughly static for
several years at about Pounds 7.5m in total.
But narrowing its activities had two side-effects. It virtually removed the
council from the view of politicians and other opinion-formers, and it
reinforced the impression that it was drifting away from its broad design
remit to an excessive concern with engineering aspects of design. As a
result, when the DTI decided to transfer the council's direct industrial
services last autumn to Business Links, the government's new network of
multi-purpose centres, Whitehall was uncertain about the shape, size and
direction the council should take. Hence the four-month review, and
yesterday's announcement by the DTI.

FT  16 MAR 94 / TV deal proposed on Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable television companies yesterday proposed co-operating with the BBC over
rights to the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships.
The BBC's four-year agreement with the All England Club will end with this
summer's championships. British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture
backed by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has said it will bid
against the BBC.
The cable industry wants to broaden and develop its programming and is
interested in acquiring more exclusive rights to sports events. A consortium
of cable companies recently paid Pounds 7m for exclusive rights to the 1996
World Cricket Cup.
At Wimbledon, cable companies want to televise play on the outer courts
which is rarely covered by the BBC. Cable could thus help the BBC with the
cost of acquiring the rights to televise Wimbledon without detracting from
its own coverage.
'I think it would be a logical development,' Mr Richard Woollam,
director-general of the Cable Television Association, said yesterday. He
agreed, however, that the BBC had rebuffed previous approaches on the issue.
Mr Woollam emphasised that the cable companies had no intention of buying
exclusive sports rights and then handing over short news items about the
events to the conventional broadcasters. He said that the cable industry
wanted to split rights with the terrestrial broadcasters in a way that
increased choice for the audience.
Cable executives believe that buying up sports rights and then depriving the
majority of the audience of coverage could create a political backlash.
The cable industry has so far spent Pounds 1.5bn on developing its networks
and plans to spend an additional Pounds 1.2bn this year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Police given new cautioning guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New guidelines on the cautioning of suspects, which are likely to increase
the number of prosecutions and ultimately the size of the prison population,
were sent to police forces in England and Wales yesterday by Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary.
The move follows widespread public concern that too many offenders were
escaping prosecution through inappropriate use of cautioning by police.
Mr Howard said that while 87 per cent of cautions were effective, there was
a need to reduce the number of repeat cautions, stop cautions for serious
offences and ensure a more consistent application by police forces.
The guidelines say:
Police should consider whether a caution is likely to be effective and
whether it is appropriate to the offence.
Juveniles should not necessarily be cautioned rather than prosecuted just
because they are young.
Cautions should only be used in exceptional circumstances for serious
offences.
Multiple cautions should only be considered where the subsequent offence is
trivial or where some time has elapsed since the original caution.
Mr Harry Fletcher, general secretary of the National Association of
Probation Officers, said abandoning repeat cautions would result in 60,000
extra prosecutions a year and an increase in the prison population.
In 1992, there were 321,000 cautions for all offences, compared with 279,000
in 1991, and 1,735 cautions for more serious, indictable offences.
The Home Office estimates there will be 50,000 fewer cautions each year but
not all will result in prosecutions.
Police forces piloting so-called Cautioning Plus schemes, in which
conditions such as supervision or community work are attached, are being
asked to monitor the results.
The Police Federation welcomed the guidelines and Mr Howard's recognition
that the decision to issue a caution should always be taken by the police.
Federation chairman Dick Coyles said research showed too many offenders had
received multiple cautions which brought the system into 'disrepute' with
youngsters equating a caution with being 'let off'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Curb wind farms, says tourist board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Restrictions on wind farms are backed by the Wales Tourist Board today in a
strategy for tourism in the principality.
The board says in its Tourism 2000 strategy document - to be launched today
by Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary: 'The quality of Wales's natural

'Tourism 2000 recognises the need to conserve and enhance that environment
and is concerned about threats which might impact upon the industry, for

Wales has eight wind farms, about a third of the UK total, and planning
consent is being sought for many more. But opposition from local authorities
and residents is increasing because of the visual intrusion and noise of the
turbines.
The WTB says the strategy's overall aim 'is to achieve sustainable
development which respects the needs of the environment and is sensitive to
the aspirations of the host community'.
The strategy hopes to create 10,000 jobs in the principality and a growth in
earnings of Pounds 700m in current prices by the year 2000. Tourism employs
about 95,000 people in Wales, or 9 per cent of the workforce, and
contributes Pounds 1.3bn, or 6 per cent, to the principality's gross
domestic product.
Wales is the second most popular destination for UK holidaymakers after the
West Country. But the board acknowledges: 'The image of Wales to potential
new visitors elsewhere in the UK remains somewhat problematical, while in
overseas markets the image is insufficiently strong to get the country on to
the shopping list of possible destinations.'
It says there needs to be effective marketing, improvements in customer
care, more investment to improve visitor satisfaction and cleaner beaches.
There is an urgent need to rationalise promotional activities, 'reducing the
proliferation of tourism literature'.
Next month the board will introduce new grant schemes, including for the
upgrading of hotels and guest houses and for conference facilities.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Corporate cash rise points to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidity of large UK industrial and commercial companies increased in
the final quarter of last year, confirming the picture of continued
corporate recovery.
Figures yesterday from the Central Statistical Office showed that the
liquidity ratio, which is a ratio of companies' current assets to current
liabilities, rose to 130 per cent at the end of last year, up from from 122
per cent in the third quarter and up from 105 per cent in the fourth quarter
of 1992.
Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming, said: 'They confirm
the picture which has been emerging for some time of a corporate sector
happy to accumulate cash.'
He said companies might be reluctant to invest because they were looking for
an unreasonably high rate of return on investment after being over-exposed
to debt in the 1980s. 'At the moment there's no obvious desire by firms to
invest or to acquire, but we may see that soon.'
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said: 'These figures show
that the corporate sector is moving further back into cashflow surplus, a
necessary precursor to a revival in capital spending.'
The liquidity ratio of large manufacturers increased to 114 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1993 from 102 per cent in the third quarter, and the ratio
for large non-manufacturing companies rose to 153 per cent from 151 per
cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Construction orders show 30% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction orders won by contractors rose 30 per cent during the three
months to the end of January compared with the corresponding period 12
months earlier.
The figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show
that the upsurge in orders since the autumn has continued, providing further
evidence that the recession in the industry may be coming to an end.
The value of orders at constant 1990 prices during the latest three-month
period is the highest since April, May and June in 1989. Orders last year
rose almost 12 per cent to Pounds 22.84bn, adjusted to take account of
seasonal variations. This compared with a peak of Pounds 26.45bn in 1989.
Total orders in January of Pounds 2.17bn were 16 per cent higher than in the
same month in 1993, although Pounds 321m lower than in December.
Contractors say opportunities to tender for work have risen sharply, but
they remain perturbed by the low prices at which jobs are being won. These
leave little or no profit margin unless companies can claim substantial
extra payments to cover design and specification changes.
The department's figures show private-sector housing orders during the
latest three months 12 per cent higher than during the previous three months
and 45 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago.
Infrastructure orders compiled on the same basis were 49 per cent and 46 per
cent higher. Private industrial orders were 30 per cent higher than a year
earlier.

FT  16 MAR 94 / EU scrutineers move into the driving seat: Efforts to
increase competition on the forecourts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday in effect handed to Brussels responsibility for
implementing the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendations for
increasing competition in car sales.
In doing so it has acknowledged its failure to make carmakers fall into line
with the MMC's findings and angered consumer groups which claim that car
prices are excessively high in Britain.
It has also irritated the country's 7,000 franchised dealer groups, many of
which maintain that competition is being thwarted by manufacturer
restrictions on dealer activities. But manufacturers are pleased at being
given breathing space while the future structure of car retailing and
distribution in Europe is decided by the European Commission.
Motorists and other interested parties must now wait to see what conclusions
the commission reaches in its review of 'block exemption', the selective
distribution system which allows carmakers to sell vehicles through
exclusive networks.
The system - which requires exemption from EU competition rules - is blamed
by consumer groups for allegedly making UK car prices higher than in many
other parts of Europe. It is also the focus of the MMC's case for increased
competition.
The EU exemption, granted in 1985, runs out on June 30 next year. The motor
industry has already been warned by the EU competition directorate that
renewal will depend largely on manufacturers' adherence to EU limits on car
price differentials across Europe and other signs that consumers are not
being disadvantaged.
It is the hope of the UK government that the MMC's concerns will be
adequately addressed by the European Commission. The MMC report on car
distribution and sales, published almost two years ago, found that a complex
monopoly existed in favour of 24 car suppliers.
It identified a number of restrictions imposed by suppliers in agreements
with dealers as operating against the public interest. It also found that a
scale monopoly existed in favour of Ford, but did not find that this
operated against the public interest.
The MMC recommended the removal of a number of restrictions on franchised
dealers imposed by some, but not all, of the leading manufacturers. It cited
those which:
Limit dealers' freedom to advertise outside their territory.
Limit dealers' freedom to hold or acquire dealerships from other car makers
outside their territory.
Prevent dealers holding or acquiring competing dealerships in their
territory.
Restrict the extent to which dealers can sell car-related goods or services,
such as hire, second-hand car sales, fast-fit or multi-brand servicing
outside their territory.
Limit the number of the manufacturer's cars that any dealer or dealer group
may sell in any given period, or the proportion of the total sales of its
cars that may be made by any dealer or dealer group.
Ford and other makers have dug in their heels against the recommendations.
Consumer groups have been consistently critical of manufacturers and
dealers, claiming that mediocre service and repair performance undermines
the concept on which block exemption had been based.
They also want a market free-for-all, with manufacturers obliged to supply
cars to virtually any outlet.
Car prices have been moving closer in line across Europe, partly due to the
recession, partly through currency shifts and as a result of EU warnings
about the conditions under which block exemption might be renewed.
The government, has found the the vehicle distribution and retailing issue
more complex than at first appeared and has concluded that to seek to impose
its will now, with only 15 months to go before the block exemption expires,
would muddy the waters unnecessarily around the European Commission's own
deliberations.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Mail order boosts retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large supermarkets and mail order companies were the principal beneficiaries
of February's growth in retail sales, the Confederation of British Industry
said yesterday.
Its distributive trades survey showed that retailers with only one shop
reported a small annual decline in volumes. The survey reports the views of
companies as a balance of those reporting favourable conditions against
those reporting unfavourable conditions. It also compiles a balance of
expectations of conditions three months ahead.
Growth was particularly strong for mail order companies. A balance of 70 per
cent reported that sales were up on a year ago, compared with a balance of 4
per cent in January. Apart from mail order companies, shops of all sizes
reported that sales were well below normal for the time of year.
Motor traders continued to do particularly well. Their sales increased at
the strongest rate since August 1988, with the exception of January. As
stocks have been run down, orders placed with suppliers grew at their
fastest rate for over five years. But in line with the rapid sales growth,
prices increased more markedly than at any time since May 1991.
On the retail side, the survey indicated that sales were still well up on a
year before for grocers including supermarkets. But butchers, bakers and
greengrocers reported a drop in volumes compared with a year before.
Sales of furniture, carpets, clothing, hardware and DIY goods grew
moderately compared with a year before, while chemists reported their first
year-on-year fall in sales since March last year.
The survey, conducted between February 15 and March 2, covered 15,000
outlets including wholesalers, retailers and motor traders. It showed that
wholesalers' sales volumes increased in the year to February at the highest
rate since last October. Orders placed with suppliers also rose on an annual
basis in February, but at the slowest rate for six months.
On the jobs front, the survey showed that the trend towards part-time
employment in retailing continues, with these jobs being created at the
fastest rate for over three years. Full-time employment, meanwhile,
continues to fall. Business optimism about the next three months was up in
February for the fifth successive survey. But the increase was the smallest
for a year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Life insurer refuses to answer MPs' question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A direct clash between a Commons committee and a leading life insurance
company loomed yesterday after Lloyds Abbey Life refused to respond to a
question from the social security committee.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, has written to Sir Simon
Hornby, Lloyds Abbey Life chairman, urging him to repair the damage done by
the response from Mr Alan Frost, Abbey Life managing director.
Abbey Life was one of the six largest providers of personal pensions to
which the committee wrote last week, asking if they took part in a survey by
accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick of mis-selling personal pensions to
people transferring out of employers' schemes.
The study, published in December, sparked widespread public concern when it
failed to find any evidence that sales agents had met regulators'
requirements in nine out of 10 pension transfer cases.
Mr Frost's reply to Mr Field said he recognised the committee's wish to draw
its own conclusions, but he believed that responses from individual
companies might not necessarily lead to the correct conclusions.
He expressed the view that the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief watchdog which commissioned the survey, should provide the committee
with all the details.
Mr Field's letter to Sir Simon came after he had discussed the issue with Mr
Peter Thurnham, the leader of the Conservative MPs on the committee. The
matter is to be raised at the committee's meeting today.
Commons select committees have wide-ranging powers to call for persons,
papers and records. As well as featuring in the social security committee's
work on aspects of personal and state pensions, the issue of pension
transfers has arisen in the Treasury committee's financial regulation
inquiry.
Mr Field said yesterday other life insurance companies to which the
committee had written had replied, though their responses had not yet been
circulated. The committee could demand that the SIB reveal which companies
had taken part in the survey, he said, but it was reluctant to do this
because the SIB had acquired the information on the basis that it would not
reveal it.
Regulators have emphasised that the findings of the KPMG study were
representative of the industry as a whole, but companies have been unwilling
to reveal their participation in the survey.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Radio licence set to go to dark-horse bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dark-horse bidder backed by US and Australian broadcasting groups
yesterday emerged as the most likely winner of the UK's third national
commercial radio licence with a bid more than Pounds 1m larger than its
nearest rival.
Talk Radio UK, which plans to offer 24 hour a day phone-ins, debate and
conversation, bid Pounds 3.82m a year - the highest of six bids. In second
place was Newstalk UK, a consortium led by Associated Newspapers, publisher
of the Daily Mail, which bid Pounds 2.756m.
Newstalk UK, with a news and information format, may still have an outside
chance depending on the view the Radio Authority takes of Talk Radio's
business plan. The authority will be examining the company's bid in detail
before awarding the licence in June or July.
London Broadcasting Company, the news and talk company which has lost its
two London licences, also lost a lifeline yesterday - it was fourth with a
bid of Pounds 2.007m. LBC will now go off the air in the first week of
October after more than 20 years of broadcasting to London.
Talk Radio UK is a consortium put together by Media Ventures International,
a London-based media investment fund. The bid is backed by Emmis
Broadcasting - which owns and operates radio stations in Los Angeles, New
York and Chicago - and Prime Television, a company with broadcasting
interests in Australia.
The Pounds 3.8m bid - plus 4 per cent of advertising revenue which goes to
the Treasury and an annual Pounds 400,000 licence fee to the authority
before transmitter or any other costs - looks high for a talk station. The
authority will now be looking carefully to see whether the service can be
sustained over the eight years of the licence with such costs.
When awarding the national pop music licence the authority rejected the
highest bid, Pounds 4.01m from National Broadcasting Company, and gave the
licence to the second-highest bidder, Virgin 1215, which bid Pounds 1.883m.
Mr Christopher Turner, a director of Media Ventures, denied last night that
the Talk Radio consortium had bid too high.
'It depends on your cost base,' he said. The company would not set up
expensive news operations but would use basic news headlines to stimulate
debate and controversy. In the US, he said, the chat format was among the
most successful.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Muddle over rail privatisation forces special bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has been forced to draw up a special bill to correct a rail
privatisation muddle which accidentally reduced the powers of the British
Transport Police.
The decision follows claims by the Transport Police Federation that an error
in the Railway Privatisation Act could leave railway police virtually
powerless in an emergency.
The error arose because the act defined the powers of the transport police
on the basis of the 1949 act, which nationalised the railways.
The clause dealing with police powers ignored several amendments to the 1949
act that significantly widened the powers of the 2,200 transport police
officers. In effect, the new act allows transport police to deal with
incidents affecting privatised railway companies, but prevents them carrying
out further inquiries.
Transport police officers say the act also makes it unclear whether they
would have the authority to pursue offenders outside railway property.
The government intended to correct the error during the later stages of the
privatisation bill, but ran out of time.
Ministers then hoped to use the police and magistrates courts bill or the
criminal justice bill to amend the privatisation act.
However, ministers have been forced to accept that neither bill will become
law before April 1, when British Rail's track and infrastructure will pass
into the ownership of Railtrack.
Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister of state, said the government would
table a special one-clause bill to take effect later this month.
Mr Mike Bevan, the federation's chairman, said transport ministers were
warned about the error several times before the act became law in November.
Opposition MPs said the muddle reflected the government's determination to
force the bill through without sufficient debate. 'This is a classic example
of ministerial arrogance at its worst,' said Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP
for Thurrock.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Customs won over by baggy fashions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trends in teenage fashion finally reached senior officials at the Customs 
Excise Department, who have agreed to stop children's baggy clothing falling
into the value added tax net.
In sombre statement yesterday, the department announced it would issue a
revised schedule of maximum measurements of clothing and footwear eligible
for relief.
The effect will be to waive VAT on sales of baggy trousers and sweatshirts
in sizes designed for children aged up to 14.
The move followed 18 months of discussion with clothing manufacturers, which
claimed that the latest styles of baggier clothing were being unfairly
excluded from the VAT relief applicable to children's clothes. 'This
reflects the fact that fashions change and children are getting bigger,'
said Ms Liz Fox, assistant director of the British Clothing Industry
Association.
Customs officials had raised worries about whether adults would be able to
squeeze into the clothes and wear them skin-tight. They have now got around
the problem by permitting extra large chest and waist measurements, but more
child-length sleeve and inside leg sizes.
'Grown-ups aren't going to get away with it,' a Customs official said
yesterday, adding that girls' shoes between sizes 1 1/2 and 5 1/2 would have
relief from VAT provided they were not fashion shoes.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Defence chief's successor named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Sir Peter Inge yesterday became chief of the Defence Staff in
succession to Sir Peter Harding, who resigned after newspaper allegations of
adultery.
Sir Peter, a 58-year-old Sandhurst officer who became chief of the General
Staff two years ago after service in a number of countries, had been acting
as caretaker military adviser to the government until Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, confirmed him as Britain's top military officer.
High among the new defence chief's priorities will be to restore morale in
the armed services at a time of almost continuous upheaval.
The resignation of his combative but popular pre-decessor - whose political
skills made him a formidable spokesman for the military in a
Treasury-dominated Whitehall - came at a time of sharp defence cuts and
fierce debate over deployment of fresh UK troops in Bosnia. Study teams are
seeking savings of Pounds 2.3bn in support operations across the military
and the MoD.
The Ministry of Defence yesterday confirmed that it was conducting an
enquiry into the 'possible implications' of the 'security angles' of Sir
Peter Harding's alleged affair with the former wife of the ex-MP Sir Anthony
Buck.
Sir Peter, 60, quit immediately details of his affair with Bienvenida
Sokolow, the divorced wife of former Tory MP Sir Antony Buck, appeared in
the News of the World.
Sir Peter Inge, who becomes a field marshal, has in turn been succeeded by
General Sir Charles Guthrie, 55, who was until yesterday commander of
British Forces in Germany.
Sir Peter's appointment to the Pounds 112,083-a-year post was warmly
welcomed by the opposition. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary said:
'I have known Sir Peter for some time and have a high regard for his
abilities.'
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: 'At a very
difficult time in defence policy there could not be a better appointment
than that of Sir Peter Inge. He will bring to the job a very considerable
experience allied to an intimate knowledge of the working of Whitehall.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Treasury urged to act on Tube funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior members of the panel set up to promote private finance in
public-sector projects yesterday urged the Treasury to end a funding logjam
for the London Under-ground.
A large number of the members of the government's private finance panel
recommended that ministers should put a deal to lease new trains for the
Northern Line out to competitive tender. They believe the issue could become
a test case for the panel.
ABB Transportation, the Derby-based manufacturer of rolling stock, has
offered to build, maintain and operate about 100 new trains for Pounds 440m
under a 20-year licensing deal.
Some members of the panel want the Treasury to accept the deal if no better
offer comes out of the competitive tendering process.
The Treasury has rejected the ABB offer because its guidelines state that
there is little attraction in leasing if it represents a deferred purchase
because this could normally be financed more cheaply by the government.
Treasury ministers also believe that ABB's payment for supplying the trains
should be directly linked to traffic on the Northern Line.
But panel members have questioned how the operating risk can be transferred
to a supplier which has no control over the Northern line's operation.
One member said: 'If the private finance panel cannot persuade the Treasury
to see a way through this problem there is little point in our existence.'
Although the panel was careful not to make a public recommendation, the
lobbying by senior members to break the impasse was yesterday welcomed by
many Conservative MPs representing London constituencies.
A number of them yesterday added their voices to calls for renewed
investment for the Northern Line.
Mr John Marshall (Hendon South) said the government should take advantage of
the offer from ABB.
ABB's proposals would meet almost half of the Pounds 1bn costs of
modernising rolling stock, signals and track. The newest rolling stock on
the line is 34 years old.
The Department of Transport is strongly in favour of the proposals.
London First, the business consortium which seeks to promote the capital, is
seeking to gain support for the ABB deal from leading business-men.
Some members of the private finance panel also want the Treasury to think
again about a Pounds 4m deal to lease automatic access gates for 12 of its
busiest stations.
It was the second time in a month that a London Underground proposal to
bring in private finance to pay for investments had met Treasury objections.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Air bubbles join war on oil spills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air bubbles have become the latest weapon in the battle to contain small oil
spills from tankers, Robert Corzine writes. Shell has installed a
bubble-based containment system - shown in use above - at its Stanlow
manufacturing centre at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. A wall of bubbles
released from hundreds of small holes in hoses anchored to the bottom of the
Manchester Ship Canal is strong enough to confine minor spills of oil or
chemicals, giving crews time to activate more substantial containment
systems, such as inflatable booms. The system was tested by the Royal Navy
at Plymouth

FT  16 MAR 94 / Carsberg rebuffs credit card industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, is to hold a public
hearing in September on whether there should be a change in the law on
credit card issuers.
At present, where goods or services paid for by a credit card are not
delivered or are misrepresented, issuers are liable for transactions.
The removal of credit providers' joint and several liability was one of the
recommendations from the de-regulation task forces set up by the Department
of Trade and Industry.
While the Credit Card Research Group, financed by the credit card industry,
welcomed the public hearing, Sir Bryan rejected the card issuers' argument
that the law was unclear and emphasised that card issuers would be breaking
their obligations under the consumer credit act if they refused to meet
legitimate claims.
He also signalled that he was far from convinced of the need for change. 'I
should certainly find it difficult to recommend a change in the law towards
a 'second-in-line' approach without clear agreement by all card issuers as
to the extent, particularly for overseas transactions, beyond which it would
not be reasonably practicable for consumers to go in pursuit of a defaulting
supplier before they could seek redress from a card issuer standing
'second-in-line'.'
The research group argued that the law gave less protection to people buying
goods using cheques or cash than to those using credit cards.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Major says IRA cannot bomb its way to talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA cannot bomb its way to the negotiating table, Mr John Major told MPs
yesterday, as the government stepped up efforts in a series of
behind-closed-doors meetings to co-ordinate a convincing response to the
latest wave of terrorist attacks.
A 50-minute meeting yesterday morning between the prime minister and Mr
James Molyneaux focused on the political talks process and security, with
the Ulster Unionist party leader calling for pressure to be put on Dublin to
crack down on terrorism.
This was followed immediately by a secret session of the cabinet
subcommittee on terrorism, chaired by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and
containing seven of his cabinet colleagues.
The prime minister is understood to have held a second short meeting with Mr
Molyneaux yesterday afternoon.
The UUP leader later released a toughly worded statement describing Dublin's
'updated' arrangements for dealing with terrorists as 'seriously flawed' and
the lack of results as 'quite scandalous'.
He dealt a blow to the government's hopes of pressing ahead with the
three-stranded political talks process, saying that institutionalised
structures for dealing with north-south relations - such as those advocated
by nationalists - would not serve any practical purpose and 'merely create
suspicion'.
Pressure for the government to ensure that a tougher line is taken against
terrorism will increase tomorrow when the Tory backbench Northern Ireland
committee meets.
Meanwhile, Downing Street hinted that moves might be put in train to stage
another meeting between the prime minister and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, before their next scheduled get-together in June. One informed
source said he was certain the two men would meet before June.
It was announced yesterday that in April Mr Molyneaux will lead a
four-strong delegation to the US to meet senior politicians and White House
and State Department officials. The visit follows criticism of the unionists
for not going to the US to state their case at the same time as Mr Gerry
Adams, Sinn Fein president.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Cabinet ministers meet for secret talks on Ulster terror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A high-level committee of cabinet ministers met secretly at Westminster
yesterday as the government stepped up its efforts to co-ordinate a
convincing response to the latest wave of terrorist attacks.
Amid mounting pressure from unionists and Conservative backbenchers for a
security clampdown, powerful voices on the body - the ministerial
sub-committee on terrorism - are thought to have advised against radical new
counter-terrorist measures. They are understood to have argued instead that
talks with Dublin aimed at improving co-operation should be pursued with
increased vigour.
The committee of eight cabinet ministers, chaired by Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, is charged with keeping arrangements for countering
terrorism under review and dealing with terrorist incidents and their
consequences.
Mr John Major told MPs that the IRA could not bomb its way to the
negotiating table, while Downing Street hinted that moves might be put in
train to stage another meeting between the prime minister and Mr Albert
Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, before their next scheduled get-together in
June.
As a bomb planted close to Sevenoaks railway station in Kent was made safe,
the prime minister held what Downing Street described as 'an extremely
friendly and constructive' meeting on the political talks process and the
security situation with Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists.
Mr Molyneaux later issued a tough statement describing Dublin's 'updated'
arrangements for dealing with terrorists as 'seriously flawed' and the lack
of results as 'quite scandalous'.
He dealt a blow to the government's hopes of pressing ahead with the
three-stranded talks process, saying that institutionalised structures for
dealing with north-south relations - such as those advocated by nationalists
 -would not serve any practical purpose and 'merely create suspicion'.
The two men are understood to have held a second short meeting in the
Commons yesterday afternoon.
Pressure for the government to ensure that a tougher line is taken against
terrorism north and south of the border will increase tomorrow when the Tory
backbench Northern Ireland committee meets.
At prime minister's questions the Tory MP Mr Terry Dicks, whose constituency
covers part of Heathrow airport, raised the issue of the three mortar
attacks and demanded a 'shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland to enable
the security forces to eliminate all IRA terrorists'.
Separately, it was announced yesterday that Mr Molyneaux will next month
lead a four-man delegation to the US to meet senior politicians. The visit
follows criticism of the unionists for not stating their case in the US at
the same time as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president.
Mr Peter Robinson, the hardline Democratic Unionist MP, called for 'urgent
efforts' to set up a united unionist front against the Downing Street
declaration.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Amendment to police bill agreed by Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords yesterday reluctantly approved complex provisions which
put into effect a government climbdown over the appointment of police
authorities, Ivor Owen writes.
They were described as an 'elaborate farce' by Lord Callaghan, former Labour
prime minister, who forecast they would be swept away when parliament next
dealt with legislation on the police.
Tory backbench peers, whose original condemnation of the powers sought by Mr
Michael Howard, home secretary, forced his retreat, criticised the
complexity of amendments.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 'complicated arrangement' to be
inserted into the police and magistrates' courts bill would ensure that
members of police authorities would be 'truly independent'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Fishermen want seal culling resumed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fishermen want seal culling to be renewed to cut down the growing numbers of
seals which they say are threatening their livelihoods by damaging fish
stocks and equipment, James Buxton writes.
A group from the Scottish Fishermens' Federation, including representatives
of English and Irish fishermen's organisations, will tell Scottish Natural
Heritage, the environmental agency for Scotland, that since culling was
banned in 1978 it estimates the number of grey seals around the UK coast has
risen from 70,000 to between 100,000 and 110,000. About 90,000 are thought
to be in Scottish waters.
Mr Roddy McColl, chairman of the group, says it has scientific evidence
suggesting that seals are eating up to 240,000 tonnes of fish a year. This
means that 'seals have a substantial EU quota to themselves'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Unions protest at injury cash curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of unions has threatened legal action against Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, over plans to reform the criminal injuries compensation
system and replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff from April 1.
Unions representing nurses, firefighters, train drivers, teachers, local
authority workers and bank staff are concerned that the new scheme will
leave members worse off when they are seriously injured at work by criminal
assault.
Backed by the TUC, they claim that the home secretary is in breach of his
duty under the 1988 Criminal Justice Act in abolishing the criminal injuries
compensation board by parliamentary order, rather than by primary
legislation.
In a letter to Mr Howard, Mr Andrew Dismore of solicitors Robin Thompson and
Partners says the unions 'will have no option but to take appropriate legal
proceedings' unless the proposed scheme is withdrawn.
Legal action would take the form of an application to the courts for a
judge's order requiring the home secretary to cancel his plan.
'The unions have been forced to take the government to court as a last
resort to defend the interests of ordinary working people who are the
victims of violent crime during their employment,' said Mr Dismore
yesterday.
The unions concerned are the Fire Brigades union, the NASUWT teachers'
union, the Royal College of Nursing, Aslef, the train drivers' union, the
NatWest staff association and the general unions Unison, GMB and TGWU.
'My clients are deeply distressed that their members should be the victims
of a costcutting exercise by the government,' Mr Dismore says in his letter
to Mr Howard. 'Moreover I have advised my clients that the new scheme has
been introduced unconstitutionally and unlawfully.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Ship repairer set to buy Cammell Laird yard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cammell Laird, the Merseyside military shipyard which closed last year, is
within weeks of being sold to a ship repair company which plans to employ
1,600 people there by the end of next year.
VSEL, the Barrow-based nuclear submarine builder which owns the Birkenhead
yard, yesterday confirmed that a March 31 deadline had been imposed for
completion.
The bidder is Coastline Industries, which already leases Cammell Laird's dry
docks and other facilities and has taken on about 600 workers in the past
year to fulfil contracts with several shipping lines and owners.
Coastline was founded five years ago by Mr John Stafford, a former Grant
Thornton accountant, to exploit ship repairing opportunities which could
emerge from the upturn of trade at the port of Liverpool and intensification
of Irish Sea trade.
The deal was negotiated in January by Mr Amin Amiri, corporate finance
partner of Grant Thornton in Liverpool, but completion has been bogged down
by legal arguments over site values and long-term environmental liabilities.
These are understood to have forced VSEL to lower its price while confining
future use of the site to shipbuilding and ship repair.
VSEL has imposed the March 31 deadline to force sale or withdrawal. Mr
Norman Broadhurst, VSEL finance director, said: 'There are other
shipbuilding companies now interested. We gave Coastline exclusivity, but it
is now up to them to complete.'
Rival bids for Cammell Laird are understood to depend on the European
Commission allowing intervention funding. Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for
Birkenhead, and Mr Barry Porter, Conservative MP for neighbouring Wirral
South, discussed this in Brussels yesterday. However, VSEL has been
consistently refused EU help for Cammell Laird because it made warships -
intervention funding has so far been limited to civil yards facing closure.
Mr Jonathan Diggines, director of the Manchester office of Murray Johnstone,
the Glasgow-based fund manager, yesterday confirmed it would be underwriting
the deal. The price is not being disclosed, but about Pounds 10m is
understood to be available. Allied Irish Banks is providing loan and working
capital for Coastline's expansion.
Coastline has brought in Mr Alan Greenough, a deal-making specialist, in an
attempt to push the sale through.
If the deal is completed, Coastline will take over Cammell Laird's
all-weather construction hall, three dry docks and its wet basin. Some of
the facilities may be leased later.
Aluminium Shipbuilders, which specialises in large catamarans, has looked at
the construction hall as a site for building third-generation Seacat
ferries.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Howard changes cautioning guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New guidelines on the cautioning of suspects, which are likely to increase
the number of prosecutions and ultimately the size of the prison population,
were sent to police forces in England and Wales yesterday by Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary.
The move follows widespread public concern that too many offenders were
escaping prosecution through inappropriate use of cautioning by police.
Mr Howard said that while 87 per cent of cautions were effective, there was
a need to reduce the number of repeat cautions, stop cautions for serious
offences and ensure a more consistent application by police forces.
The guidelines say:
Police should consider whether a caution is likely to be effective and
whether it is appropriate to the offence.
Juveniles should not necessarily be cautioned rather than prosecuted just
because they are young.
Cautions should only be used in exceptional circumstances for serious
offences.
Multiple cautions should only be considered where the subsequent offence is
trivial or where some time has elapsed since the original caution.
Mr Harry Fletcher, general secretary of the National Association of
Probation Officers, said abandoning repeat cautions would result in 60,000
extra prosecutions a year and an increase in the prison population.
In 1992, there were 321,000 cautions for all offences, compared with 279,000
in 1991, and 1,735 cautions for more serious, indictable offences.
The Home Office estimates there will be 50,000 fewer cautions each year but
not all of these cases will result in prosecutions.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Cut feared in plans for road building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Civil engineering and building materials companies are increasingly worried
that higher-than-expected construction costs will persuade the government to
make substantial cuts in the road-building programme, Andrew Taylor writes.
Ministers are expected to announce reductions in construction plans after a
review of the 10-year national road programme, which is worth Pounds 23bn.
Contractors fear cuts may be deeper than expected because of rising costs.
Many contracts won at low prices during the recession have turned out to be
much more expensive, with costs up to 40 per cent higher than the tender
price according to some contractors. Claims for additional payments to cover
changes in specification or unexpected ground conditions have allowed
contractors to recover some of the margin they may have lost by bidding a
low price.
Tender prices for new work have also stopped falling and may even have risen
slightly.
In the Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had indicated that lower
construction prices caused by the recession would protect building plans.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Gummer aims to reduce car use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities in England will be encouraged to take planning decisions
that limit the scale of out-of-town developments and reduce reliance on
private cars under guidance issued yesterday.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, announced planning guidelines
intended to reduce the growth of car and commercial vehicle journeys and to
increase the scope for use of public transport.
The planning guidance note represents the most detailed statement on
transport policy since the government committed itself to an environmental
strategy at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.
Three main aims of the new planning policy are:
To ensure that new developments which necessitate journeys are built where
there is a choice of transport. Shops, offices, cinemas and leisure centres
should be close together so one journey can serve several purposes.
To provide housing developments with public transport links and nearby local
services so that journeys can be made on foot or bicycle.
To improve the quality of life in towns and cities - which are efficient
transport locations - while maintaining the vitality of the countryside, in
order to reduce the need for long-distance commuting.
Consistent policies to reduce the need to travel could result in a 15 per
cent reduction in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions over 20 years, Mr
Gummer said.
The impact of the new policies will be gradual because only 1 per cent to 2
per cent of the country's stock of buildings is renewed each year. But over
time the new policy, combined with the government's plan to raise fuel duty
by at least 5 per cent a year, will make a difference.
The government is keen to prevent the spread of out-of-town superstores
which can be reached only by car. Sainsbury, the food retailer with many
out-of-town superstores, said it was studying the detail of the government's
plans, adding that food shopping accounted for only 2.5 per cent of total
household car mileage.
Friends of the Earth said traffic growth would not be cut while transport
secretary Mr John MacGregor's 'motorway mania is allowed to continue'. His
department is soon to announce a review of its Pounds 23bn road-building
programme.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England called for a shift in
government spending from roads to public transport. 'We still don't see
evidence of rural communities being given a viable choice of public
transport,' it said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Paramount may trigger payout delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insolvency practitioners yesterday warned that payments to creditors of
companies in receivership and administration could be substantially delayed
as a result of the Court of Appeal's ruling on Paramount Airways.
The concern came in spite of the government's decision on Monday to
introduce emergency insolvency legislation in the next two weeks to reduce
employment obligations in the future.
In a Commons statement, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
said new legislation would provide that only the limited costs of wages,
salaries and pension contributions of staff would rank as secured creditors
to companies in receivership or administration.
His comments came in response to lobbying by the insolvency profession after
the court's ruling earlier this month suggested that administrators were
deemed to have adopted the contractual employment obligations of the company
after 14 days.
Practitioners said yesterday they were waiting to study the small print in
the draft legislation, expected over the next few days, and had concerns
about residual obligations.
Some argued that it would have been better had Mr Heseltine proposed that
receivers and administrators would not be deemed to have adopted the
contracts of employment of staff in companies if they issued no new
contracts within 14 days of their appointment.
The statement will have no effect on additional contractual employment
claims which may be triggered on companies entering administration or
receivership before this week.
Mr John Alexander, an insolvency partner with Pannell Kerr Forster, said he
was likely to ask for indemnities to any banks before authorising further
payments, so that he could reclaim the money if necessary.
Mr Mark Homan, president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, said
it would take 'many months' to quantify potential additional employment
costs.
Additional employment claims could be triggered in many cases, including
Swan Hunter, Leyland Daf and Ferranti, although they are less likely where
the company has been bought as a going concern and the obligations taken on
by the purchaser.
The Paramount creditors' committee, which met on Monday, has until Friday to
decide whether to take the Court of Appeal's ruling to the House of Lords.
It has agreed provisionally to proceed, but needs to prepare a legal case
and raise at least Pounds 100,000 from the insolvency profession to cover
the costs.
Other insolvency practitioners are considering whether other cases might be
taken through the courts and interpreted more favourably.
Meanwhile, Michael Mayes, the Rotherham-based textile company which was
highlighted as the first large business to be affected by the Paramount
ruling, was preparing yesterday to lay off all but 15 of its 140 staff. The
receiver has given the management until Monday to prepare a buy-out offer.
It will have to raise tens of thousands of pounds for the purchase, and meet
a large additional working capital requirement.
The employment obligations are believed to exceed the value of the company's
assets. There was no sign last night of an external buyer.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Lords reluctantly approve amendment to police bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords yesterday reluctantly approved complex provisions which
put into effect a government climbdown over the appointment of police
authorities.
They were described as an 'elaborate farce' by Lord Callaghan, former Labour
prime minister, who forecast they would be swept away when parliament next
dealt with legislation on the police.
Tory backbench peers, whose condemnation of the powers originally sought by
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, forced his retreat, also criticised
the length and complexity of the amendments.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 'complicated arrangement' which
peers had been asked to insert into the police and magistrates' courts bill
would ensure that members of police authorities would be 'wholly and truly
independent'. Membership would normally include nine councillors and three
magistrates, and five independent members co-opted from 10 names provided by
the home secretary. Earl Ferrers said he would now choose the 10 from a
shortlist of 20 provided by a local selection panel.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, chief Labour speaker in the debate, urged peers
to accept the new provisions in the interests of reaching an agreement which
would not be overturned in the Commons.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Best-selling trust to suffer yield cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group offering a 10 per cent return on its best-selling trust has warned
70,000 investors that it will cut the yield to 9 per cent from June 28.
The high-income unit trust offered by fund manager Foreign  Colonial has
pulled in more than Pounds 500m since its launch just over a year ago.
It was particularly attractive to income seekers and heavily promoted by
many financial intermediaries because of the 10 per cent yield.
Such funds, which obtain an unusually high income, have been highly
controversial because they can procure such high returns only at the expense
of the capital growth prospects.
Many experts believe savers' capital could actually be eroded in order to
keep the income flowing.
Over the past year, anyone investing in the FC fund would have lost roughly
10 per cent of their initial investment - neatly cancelling out the benefit
of the 10 per cent income. Most conventional equity income funds have
produced a significantly better return.
Mr Simon James, FC director, said the decision to cut the target yield on
the fund was mainly because the group expects interest rates to move lower
this year. He added that the group also wants to give investors plenty of
notice of the impending cut in yield.
FC has also trimmed its management charge from 1.5 per cent to 1.25 per
cent with effect from April 6.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Beijing and the business of human rights -
US company fears of losing their fastest growing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, confronted Chinese
officials in Beijing at the weekend on the vexed issue of human rights and
trading rights, it was the American who blinked first.
Since last June the administration of President Bill Clinton has vowed to
annul China's Most Favoured Nation trade status unless it improved its human
rights record. However, in spite of compromising noises made by Mr
Christopher as he left Beijing on Monday, China has not only failed to make
any 'significant' progress to which the secretary of state could point, it
has yet even to offer political cover for what appears to be a US retreat.
China has had dangled before it the possibility of permanent MFN status but
has remained insistent that the human rights of its citizens is its own
business. Its officials are of the view that the US needs China as much as
China needs the US. They might be right.
US companies have committed or invested Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) in
China. It is their fastest growing export market, according to Ms Pam
Baldinger, communications director of the Business Coalition for US-China
trade. The group of 1,000 companies warns that loss of China's MFN status,
and subsequent reprisals, would put all the investment at risk.
American exports to China soared by 19 per cent in 1992 and 17 per cent last
year. Most of the market is in sophisticated technology, capital equipment
and aerospace, industries which provide the high wage jobs Mr Clinton has
promised to increase.
More than anything, it is China's potential that draws hungry companies in
droves. According to the Business Coalition, the potential market looks like
this: Dollars 40bn over the next 20 years for aerospace; Dollars 90bn over
the next seven years for power generation equipment; Dollars 29bn over five
years for telecommunications; Dollars 18.2bn over three years for oilfield
and gas machinery and Dollars 4.3bn over the next eight years for computers.
Withdrawal of MFN would make a gift of these markets to European and
Japanese competitors. It would also cost US consumers an estimated Dollars
16bn they save buying cheap Chinese goods.
'Loss of MFN would poison the trade environment,' said Mr Bill Lane of
Caterpillar, which had a 20 per cent surge in sales of construction and
mining equipment to China last year. With Japanese suppliers still in the
lead, 'it's critical that MFN be renewed', he said.
American Telephone and Telegraph has been making deep inroads in China. Mr
Randolph Lumb, government relations vice president for ATT, said the
company can generate Dollars 6-Dollars 8 through trade with its China
subsidiaries for every Dollars 1 invested there.
In Guangdong province, the company has beaten formidable competition from
entrenched companies such as Alcatel, the French telecoms equipment maker,
and Ericsson, the Swedish group, to win big switching and transmission
contracts. Its joint venture in Shanghai is the leading supplier of telecom
transmission equipment in the country.
Sales of switching and transmission systems are rising. ATT Network Systems
has fibre optic and transmission joint ventures in China with switching and
microelectronic ventures under negotiation. ATT Bell Laboratories is
working with the Chinese government to set up a research and development
operation in the country.
China also offers hope for the US commercial aircraft sector, which has been
hit hard by competition from the European Airbus consortium and by recession
abroad. McDonnell Douglas has been in China since 1975 selling aircraft and
producing components.
'It took 10 years to get that project off the ground,' said Mr Mark
Schlansky, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman. 'It required a great deal of
patience. Trust had to be built on both sides. Progress had to be
incremental. Now we've learned their values, and they've learned ours.'
One sector - textiles and apparel - projects gains if China was to lose its
MFN status. The American Textiles Manufacturers Institute says China has
become the largest foreign US textile supplier, but higher tariffs would cut
into its exports. It was unlikely that China's quota share would be
redistributed, the association said. The gain would be for US companies.
Most exporters anonymously fault the Clinton administration for taking
seriously the president's rhetoric on China during his election campaign.
Like Mr Cal Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, they argue
that the development of China's market economy promotes human rights more
than any other measure.
Companies complain that the administration has sent mixed signals. The
commerce department put China on top of its Big Emerging Markets list, a
strategy for pushing exports in 10 regions outside the European Union and
Japan. At the same time the president and the state department were issuing
threats.
Exporters are weary of the annual MFN renewal exercise. They hope that,
given any reasonable progress, the administration will give China a multiple
year renewal or look elsewhere for a less ruinous issue with which to put
presure on Beijing.
On Capitol Hill, where the Democrats used to assail President George Bush
regularly for not promoting human rights, sentiment has begun to shift
towards renewing MFN. 'There are too many jobs at stake,' said a long-time
congressional aide. 'The momentum now has gone the other way.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels set for retreat on textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is preparing for a climbdown on the harsh textile
import restrictions from China it imposed on Monday.
A meeting of the textiles committee today is likely to review both the
administration and the size of the new quotas just a few days after they
came into force - an acknowledgement that the EU substantially misjudged the
size of trade flows and the number of companies doing business with China.
Most textiles products from China, which is not a member of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are covered by bilateral deals under the
Multi Fibre Arrangement, which controls around 70 per cent of trade in the
sector. But some products, like silk shirts, are not covered by the MFA but
are controlled under the 'autonomous regime' of national quotas.
Last Friday evening, Brussels announced the size of the new EU-wide quota
that was to replace national quotas, under single market rules, from this
Monday onwards.
Textiles companies had only the weekend to apply for import licences and
come to terms with the new quota system, which is vastly oversubscribed.
An official from the UK Trade and Industry Department said it had dealt with
and passed on 1,300 applications for quota from UK companies over the
weekend - theoretically to be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.
Silk City, which manufacturers silk shirts in China for export to the EU,
said it alone could fill the EU quota of 5,000 tonnes for silk shirts.
In Brussels, a member of the textiles committee acknowledged that the
administration of the quotas was flawed and that 'past performance' was
likely to become the criterion upon which quotas were allocated.

GEC-Alsthom said yesterday it had resolved a dispute among its South Korean
subcontractors that threatened to derail a Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn)
contract to supply the train a grande vitesse (TGV) for the country's new
high-speed rail system.
The row erupted last November when GEC-Alsthom selected Hyundai Precision
and Industry instead of Daewoo Heavy Industries to head a consortium to
build the TGV under licence in South Korea.
Daewoo protested, calling the decision unfair. It said it had been
GEC-Alsthom's main partner when the Anglo-French group bid for the
high-speed train contract against Siemens of Germany and Mitsubishi of
Japan. GEC-Alsthom said Hyundai was selected as the consortium leader on the
basis of its industrial and technical capability.
Daewoo, expressing fears that it would not have access to technology
transfers if it remained a junior partner in the consortium, filed a suit to
block talks between GEC-Alsthom and the government on a final contract.
Following the dismissal of the suit last month by a South Korean court,
Daewoo has now agreed to join the consortium with the guarantee that it will
have full access to technology transfers, GEC-Alsthom said.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with the notable
exception of the US, yesterday expressed strong support for an early
resumption of China's Gatt membership and welcomed recent moves to
liberalise trade and relax foreign exchange controls.
However, the row between the US and China over human rights, which could
lead to non-renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in the US
market, is proving a big stumbling block to faster progress in the
negotiations on Gatt entry terms. China wants to rejoin Gatt by the end of
this year, so it can be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation
which succeeds Gatt in 1995.
Entry negotiations resumed yesterday after a six-month gap, allowing Chinese
officials to present details of Beijing's latest foreign exchange and trade
reforms. These included the unification of exchange rates and a managed
float of the currency since January, with a promise of full convertibility
by the year 2000, as well as tax reform and reductions in a wide range of
tariff and non-tariff barriers.
The response yesterday was generally favourable. The European Union said the
reforms appeared to be going in the right direction, and it and Japan
expressed hopes for an acceleration of the negotiations. However, the US
said it was not prepared to subscribe to 'an artificial deadline' for
Chinese membership.
At the same time, western nations are united in pressing China to pay a
still higher Gatt entry fee, including lower barriers to trade in industrial
goods and agriculture, improved market access for foreign services companies
such as banks, and better protection of intellectual property rights. Gatt
members also seek further moves to cut state intervention in the economy and
ensure trade rules are applied consistently.
China was an original member of Gatt but pulled out in 1950 after the
Communists came to power. The Beijing government applied to re-enter Gatt in
1986 and has taken a full part in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
However, progress in the membership talks, which began in 1987, has been
slowed by human rights concerns as well as the difficulty of getting to
grips with China's rapidly evolving trade regime.

Qantas, the large Australian airline in which British Airways holds a

June 1 - a move which could sound the death knell for the fledgling
Australian carrier Australia Air International. AA secured rights to China
last year from the International Air Services Commission, which allocates
Australia's international routes.
At that stage, Qantas, which ceased operations to China in 1987, did not
make an application. AA had hoped to start operating in 1993, and even
published proposed schedules but the carrier subsequently failed to meet
IASC financial requirements. Qantas plans a once-a-week flight to Beijing
via Guangzhou, using a Boeing 767 aircraft.

US-Japanese trade and economic relations are 'in serious disrepair,' Mr

Japan must take 'its full share of responsibility in promoting global
economic growth,' he told the House trade subcommittee. It had not yet done
that in bilateral talks with the US or in the Uruguay Round.
Mr Kantor, who has pursued a tough line in efforts to encourage Japan to
produce a market-opening package containing 'numerical indicators of
progress,' won warm support for his stance from both Republicans and
Democrats on the committee.
'Unless or until Japan is prepared to take their share of responsibility
we're not going to resolve these problems.'
The US, he said, had been 'somewhat victimised' with the characterisation
that it was proposing managed trade solutions. 'The Japanese have practised
managed trade for years,' he said. 'We're trying to unmanage trade in
Japan.'
Meanwhile it emerged in Tokyo that the US has presented Japan with detailed
proposals for measures to promote deregulation and market access.
The proposals, contained in a discussion paper, were delivered to Japanese
officials in January during the framework negotiations and cover 45 specific
areas.
The Japanese government has resisted demands made by the US under the
framework negotiations to set specific objective criteria in opening up its
markets. Instead, it has hoped to deflect criticism over its huge trade
surplus by taking the initiative in compiling the deregulation plan.
In competition policy, the US is calling for the abolition of exclusionary
business practices, active application of criminal charges under the
anti-monopoly law and substantial relaxation of rules governing transport,
airline, shipping and trucking fees.
In administrative transparency, the US wants more foreign participation in
government advisory groups, while in deregulation it seeks establishment of
an independent organisation to supervise progress in deregulating the
markets.
In distribution, the US is asking for infrastructural investment to improve
rail and road access to Japanese ports and airports, more warehouse space
for imports at Narita Airport, introduction of computer systems to handle
import matters before goods arrive in Japan and greater handling of imports
by small retailers.

<TEXT>
The head of Mexico's largest financial group has disappeared in what police
are treating as a kidnapping.
Eyewitnesses said Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, president of Banamex-Accival, was
intercepted by armed men on Monday as he was being driven to work in Mexico
City.
The kidnappers have yet to make public their demands but have been in
contact with the Harp family, according to the police. The family has been
told not to co-operate with police authorities or make statements to the
press.
When news of Mr Harp's disappearance reached the Mexico City stock market,
Banacci B shares fell sharply, closing on Monday down 3.86 per cent on very
heavy volume. Shares continued to slide yesterday.
The New York security firm Kroll Associates confirmed it had been asked to
handle the case, but would offer no more information. Kroll won the release
of two businessmen kidnapped in 1992.
Kidnappers have targeted Mexican businessmen with increasing frequency with
over 2,000 kidnappings reported in the past five years. A source close to
the investigation said: 'It appears to be the work of a professional group.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Deloitte to pay Dollars 312m damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deloitte  Touche has agreed to pay Dollars 312m (Pounds 209m) to settle a
string of government charges that the big US accountancy firm failed
properly to audit several banks and savings and loan institutions which
collapsed in the 1980s.
Yesterday's settlement resolved 15 lawsuits brought against Deloitte by
various government agencies seeking Dollars 1.8bn in damages.
The lawsuits charged Deloitte with professional negligence, claiming that
the firm issued clean audits for institutions that later proved to be
insolvent.
The settlement is the second largest paid by a professional firm involved in
the SL and bank failures. In 1992 accountancy firm Ernst  Young paid
Dollars 400m after reaching a similar accord with federal authorities.
Although analysts believe that a large part of the Dollars 312m settlement
would be paid by Deloitte's insurers, the firm's partners are expected to
contribute toward the cost of the agreement. However, Mr Michael Cook,
Deloitte's chief executive, described the settlement as a 'business
necessity' and 'fair.'
The Deloitte settlement is not likely to be the last of its kind and further
settlements are expected.

FT  16 MAR 94 / US economy continues rapid growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected increase in industrial production last month indicates the US
economy is continuing to expand rapidly, increasing the chance of another
rise in short-term interest rates.
The Federal Reserve said yesterday industrial production rose 0.4 per cent
in February after 0.5 per cent in January. Most analysts had expected
production to be flat or down as a result of severe weather. The figures
suggest output is growing at an annual 7-8 per cent in the first quarter.
This suggests little slowdown in economic growth from the second half of
last year when gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5
per cent.
The Fed also reported a sharp increase in the rate of capacity utilisation
in manufacturing industry to 82.6 per cent - only fractionally below the 83
per cent level traditionally associated with rising inflationary pressure.
Separately the Commerce Department said producer prices rose 0.5 per cent
last month. However, this mainly reflected higher energy prices. 'Core'
producer prices (excluding the volatile food and energy components) rose 0.1
per cent, less than expected.
On Wall Street, bond prices closed higher as investors interpreted the
encouraging core producer price figures as a sign that rapid growth was not
yet putting upward pressure on inflation. The benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond rose 24/32 to yield 6.89 per cent in late trading.
However, the strong production figures and higher capacity utilisation rate
indicate the economy is growing faster than its long-run potential rate of
growth. This raises the chance that Fed governors and regional presidents -
who meet in Washington next week to discuss interest rate policy - will
tighten monetary policy again in coming weeks.
On February 4, the Fed raised short-term rates a quarter point to 3.25 per
cent, the first increase in five years. This led to a sharp rise in long
bond yields on the assumption that this was the first in a series of
tightening moves.
Hopes on Wall Street that economic growth would slow sharply taking pressure
off the Fed to raise rates are evaporating. New York bank J P Morgan, for
example, is projecting growth at an annual rate of 6 per cent in the second
quarter, after a brief weather-related slowdown to 3 per cent in the present
quarter. That would be not far short of the 7.5 per cent in the final period
of last year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Small business role in job creation questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses have for years commanded the profound obeisance of
politicians and economists as the most fertile source of new jobs, and
ministers gathered in Detroit this week continued to pay homage.
But economists working under the aegis of the US Commerce Department's
Census Bureau have taken a swipe at the idea that small businesses create
more jobs than larger ones, in a new study examining the performance of
manufacturing industry from 1972 to 1988.
Economists Steven Davis, John Haltiwanger and Scott Schuh found that
although smaller companies created new jobs at a much faster rate than did
larger employers, they also destroyed jobs much more quickly.
Companies with fewer than 20 employees added an average of 16.5 per cent to
their workforces each year, the study showed, but they also destroyed an
average of 18.8 per cent of their jobs.
At the same time, companies with more than 50,000 employees created new jobs
averaging 6.3 per cent of their total workforces each year and destroyed 8
per cent on average.
'In a nutshell, net job creation behaviour in the US manufacturing sector
exhibits no strong or simple relationship to employer size,' the study says.
The Census Bureau economists also note that newly created jobs at small
manufacturing plants are much less likely to survive than new jobs at large
plants.
They complain of fallacious statistical presentations of the data on job
creation, suggesting that if a company drops in size below the cut-off point
for small businesses it can seem to increase employment in the small
business sector, even if it really represents a loss of jobs.
Since large companies account for most of manufacturing employment, they
also account for most of job creation and destruction. Small businesses, the
study shows, account for less than one fifth of job creation.
But from Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, to Mr
Paul Martin, Canadian finance minister, delegates in Detroit this week
hailed small businesses as the engine of job creation.
'There's an enormous amount of creative destruction in small business. I
think there's job loss in small business but there's also a lot of job
creation,' Mr Martin said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Pressure for social clause in Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France and Italy are leading a drive to include restrictions on child labour
and forced prison labour in next month's final round of negotiations on the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economy minister, urged this week's Group of
Seven jobs conference in Detroit to press for 'a minimum of rules applied at
the international level'.
Italy strongly backed the French initiative, and both Canada and Greece,
which attended the Detroit meeting as current president of the European
Union, also expressed interest in some form of social clause to the Gatt
agreement.
French officials also expect partial support from the US, which introduced
similar protections in its North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada
and Mexico, and has been pressing similar demands in its talks with China
about the extension of Most Favoured Nation trading privileges. 'I am well
aware that the social clause is far from receiving unanimity,' said Mr
Michel Giraud, France's labour minister.
International trade union organisations have been pressing for a broader
social clause covering work safety standards, union rights and protection
against discrimination in the workplace.
But other G7 countries are reluctant to reopen the Gatt deal at this stage,
and trade experts say it is extremely unlikely that a social clause could be
inserted in the face of strong opposition from many Asian countries.

<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Labour and finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations yesterday wound up two days of discussions in Detroit about
unemployment and job creation in a warm glow of apparent harmony.
'It seemed to me that there was a new conventional wisdom emerging about the
whole question of unemployment,' said Mr Padraig Flynn, the European
commissioner for social affairs.
Ministers emerged from their meetings to say they were in broad agreement on
the need for macroeconomic policies that promote sustainable growth with low
inflation, but also that they shared a problem of structural unemployment
that would not be solved by growth alone.
'Everyone agrees it's both structural and cyclical,' said Mr Paul Martin,
Canada's finance minister.
At the same time, everyone agreed on the role of small business as an engine
of job creation, the need to improve education and vocational training and
the importance of offering the long-term unemployed a way to re-enter the
workforce.
With considerably less unanimity, the participants also spoke approvingly of
labour market flexibility.
Even when they used the same words, however, different ministers brought
different underlying meanings to them, reflecting both national and
functional divergences.
Besides occasional national splits - 'the Anglos against the rest', as one
Italian official put it - some delegations showed internal differences both
between the different political parties in their coalition governments and
between the different outlooks of labour and finance ministers.
'I've got a sense of cultural gulfs in other delegations,' said Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer.
On macroeconomic policy, the usual topic of G7 meetings, the Detroit
conference showed some of the customary disagreements.
The US argues that a considerable portion of the G7's current high
unemployment rates, particularly in Europe, must be attributed to the
recession, and therefore requires efforts to boost demand-led growth - by
interest rate cuts in Europe and by fiscal stimulus in Japan.
Japanese and European officials coolly noted the US argument, which Mr
Edmond Alphandery, France's economy minister, said had become 'quite
standard'. He noted that although continental Europe had higher unemployment
because it was at an earlier point in the recovery cycle, it was emerging
faster and with less pain than the UK and US had done.
Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economic adviser, insisted at the
opening that she would not accept the argument that structural policies
could replace cyclical policies as a recipe for dealing with unemployment.
US officials had expected some-thing of a row with the UK on this issue, but
other participants said that the argument quickly fizzled out when no-one
disagreed.
'We have never said that structural adjustments could replace a good
macroeconomic framework,' said Mr Henning Christophersen, vice president of
the European Commission.
On the issue of labour market flexibility, the division became clearer.
'Some seem to define flexibility as the freedom to fire workers and lower
wages,' complained Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, calling for
more worker empowerment and training to help mobility.
Mr Clarke, the implicit target of Mr Reich's jibe, denied any substantial
rift between the UK and the US.
'The Americans in their presentations put less emphasis on labour market
flexibility than we do but the reason is that they already have a
deregulated labour market,' Mr Clarke said.
While ministers agreed on the need to reduce the cost of labour to
employers, they differed on the extent to which this reduction should come
from the wage packets of their workers.
Canada and France urged an attack on payroll taxes, which Mr Martin
described as 'a cancer on job creation', as well as a weeding out of social
security programmes that can harm job creation.
'We feel we can eliminate part of the social support system which is a
disincentive to work and keep the basics,' Mr Martin said.
All sides drew a sigh of relief, however, at the complete absence of support
for ideas such as protectionism or a shorter working week.
'The idea of a generalised reduction of the working week was raised by
no-one. No-one proposed closing their frontiers to fight unemployment.
No-one said we should tackle unemployment by slowing the rate of
technological progress. The most tangible thing to come out of it was the
refusal to simplify the problem,' said Mr Alphandery.
In their efforts to resist populist demands such as protectionism, G7
countries hope that the Detroit gathering will provide them with useful
political cover at home.
'We'll be able to say, see - the Germans and the French and the Canadians
and the Italians and the Japanese - well, we all have the same problems,'
concluded President Bill Clinton.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton began a campaign-style swing through New Hampshire
yesterday, vowing to keep his eye on domestic policies despite attacks from
'people who are giving me hell in Washington.'
Mrs Hillary Clinton also continued the administration's attempts to divert
the nation's attention away from the Whitewater affair, stemming from the
Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s, over which they have
come under heavy fire from Republicans in Washington.
Mrs Clinton was due to address a rally in St. Louis on the second day of a
trip promoting the administration's healthcare reform plan.
On Monday night the President launched an impassioned attack on his
Republican critics and made a plea for a nationwide debate over what he
called the issues of concern to Americans.
'This overriding negative, intensely personal, totally political
devoid-of-principles attack is not good for the country,' he said. 'It is
inconsistent with the tradition of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.'
He described himself as 'an old-fashioned' man, who believes in the contest
between good and bad and that good wins out.
'We have to appeal to what is good in this country,' he said. 'We have to
ask people to face hard truth and debate hard issues and come together and
think new thoughts about problems that we are frankly not solving today.'
Mr Clinton appeared yesterday morning at a gathering of citizens in the
small New Hampshire town of Nashua, where he got heavy support during his
campaign for president.
In the friendly New Hampshire crowd, he found at least one who agreed with
his attempt to refocus the national debate.
'I'm 68 years old,' one woman told him. 'Whitewater is for canoeing and
rafting. Shame on those who would detract and distract from the important
work you're doing with universal health coverage and jobs.'
'Thank you ..bless you,' Mr Clinton said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / High pay for the few in a city out of work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just five miles down the road from the jobs summit conference centre in
Detroit the brand new Jefferson North Chrysler car plant is a standing
affront to much of the G7 debate about job creation. The highly automated
plant, which produces the Grand Cherokee jeep, is one of the success stories
of the town's revitalised car industry.
None of the jobs summit delegates would object to the 200 robots or the
automated paint spraying and welding at the plant, which reduces the number
of employees to about 3,000. But the policymakers would not approve of the
fact that, in a town where unemployment is double the national average at 13
per cent, so much employment is hogged by the securely employed 'insiders'.
Average weekly working hours at the two-shift plants are 55 to 60 hours,
with average annual take-home pay of more than Dollars 50,000 (Pounds
34,246). Most employees work from 6am to 3.30pm, plus three Saturdays in
four.
Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union collude to maximise work and
income for those already in a job, and until recently most new recruits were
relatives of existing employees. Yet Detroit has lost 250,000 auto-related
jobs in the past 10 years and there are 23,000 people on the books of the
state employment agency who want to work at Jefferson North. A few hundred
of them may be lucky if the plant decides to put in the third shift. Anybody
who gets a job will find a plant with harmonious working relationships and
strong powers for organised labour. The UAW not only has a closed shop, it
also has equal representation on the key committees which decide most of
what goes on.
Mr Charles Matthews, a semi-skilled assembly line operator, who has worked
for Chrysler for 30 years, said: 'The hours are long but this is the best
plant I've ever worked in.' He retires in two months, aged 55.
Unlike some other US car makers Chrysler took on existing workers when the
new plant opened up, which meant an average age of over 50. There were big
retraining programmes for technicians but training in general seems less
important than many summit delegates assume.
One Chrysler supervisor admitted that many of the semi-skilled jobs take
only about half an hour to learn. There is no job rotation for those on
repetitive tasks but most workers are part of a small team and training for
less skilled workers concentrates on building up team-working skills.
Jefferson North would make only a small dent in Detroit's unemployment
problem even if it was maximising rather than minimising employment
opportunities. Although the town's prospects are improving, and it has a
dynamic mayor in Mr Dennis Archer, the Clinton administration has exposed
its unemployment sores to the world by staging the job summit here.
In central Detroit the unemployment rate climbs to 17 per cent and blacks
aged 16 to 19 have an unemployment rate of 41 per cent. Sobering statistics
for those Europeans who thought the American labour market had all the
answers.

The US has informed Japan it is considering claiming damages against

Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, minister of construction, said the ministry will
investigate US allegations that 73 Japanese contractors conspired to fix
contracts to build the US navy's Atsugi Base between 1984 and 1990 and
charged inflated prices for their work.
The US has informed Japan's foreign affairs ministry that it is preparing to
seek damages of Y1.1bn (Pounds 7m) against the Japanese contractors, Mr
Igarashi said yesterday. 'As the ministry which oversees and instructs the
industry, we will look into the matter and deal with it appropriately,' the
minister said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Japan trade surplus with US declines in February

<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus with the US fell for the first time in nine months in
February, the ministry of finance said yesterday.
The slight drop in the surplus will help reduce tension with the US. But
Washington will need further and more substantial falls over an extended
period before it is convinced the problem has been solved.
The surplus with the US was Dollars 4.344bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in February, a
fall of 0.9 per cent compared with the same month last year. Imports from
the US rose 15.1 per cent, while exports grew by 6.8 per cent.
Car sales in the US were down sharply, hindered by the strong yen, but
exports of semiconductors continued to rise. Imports of US computers, food
and machinery surged in February, as did aircraft deliveries.
Analysts said the level of the surplus with the US, which was below
expectations, would help support the dollar against the yen.
Japan's overall trade surplus was up 3.3 per cent in February compared with
the same month last year, reaching a record Dollars 10.912bn, although the
increase was lower than that in previous months. In December and January,
the surplus rose 15.5 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. In yen terms,
the surplus, which had risen in January, dropped 9.1 per cent to Y1,186bn.
Japanese exports rose 5.6 per cent to Dollars 29.532bn, while imports grew 7
per cent to Dollars 18.62bn. Imports of food, including foreign rice, were
up 20.3 per cent year on year.
The growing importance of Japan's trade with other Asian countries was
underlined by a 2.6 per cent increase in exports to Asean nations and a 0.7
per cent rise in imports. Exports to China were up 0.8 per cent while
imports rose 3.6 per cent.
The markets were surprised by a rise in domestic machinery orders placed by
the private sector during January. These orders represent a leading
indicator of capital investment intentions. A fall of about 6 per cent had
been expected, but they increased 1.9 per cent against the previous month,
data released by the Economic Planning Agency showed.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Settlers ready to be martyrs or heroes: Hebron Jews could
spark war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A photograph of Rabbi Meir Kehane, the slain Jewish racist who advocated
religiously sanctified Jewish violence against Arabs, is proudly displayed
in the bedroom of a 13-year-old boy in Hebron, the city that has become a
flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
'I don't agree with Kehane but when a boy grows up and his father is stoned
and his friend's father is murdered by Arabs, you must understand why he
might see Kehane as a hero,' says the boy's mother, Mrs Ruth Hizmy.
Rising Jewish settler militancy has become the greatest political threat to
the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin and the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process. At the least, the settlers promise a nationwide campaign of civil
disobedience to resist evacuation from Palestinian areas. At worst, rising
emotions, fears and Jewish religious fundamentalism could explode into a
Jewish-Arab civil war and even Jewish-on-Jewish violence.
The 40 Jewish families settled in Hebron are in the vanguard of Jewish
militancy. Hebron is the breeding ground of the two Jewish terrorist groups,
Kach and Kehane Lives, banned by the government this week.
The Hebron massacre has worsened the settlers' tendency to be an insular
community sustained by the belief they are on a mission from God to maintain
a Jewish presence amid the 110,000 Arabs who live in Hebron, burial place of
the biblical patriarchs Abraham and Jacob, and an area sacred to both Moslem
and Jew.
They refuse to see Hebron as occupied. For them it is an intrinsic part of
the land of Israel promised to the Jews by God. Part of their cultism is
reflected in their deep belief they are being victimised, not only by the
Arabs but by their 'treacherous' Jewish government. They believe all
outsiders do not understand them and are part of a conspiracy to defeat
their religious goals.
Like all messianic cults, they have martyrs and heroes and a powerful faith
in the sanctity of dying for one's beliefs. They strongly believe in
expanding their numbers by breeding; the average family has six children,
and talking to the children is like talking to the brainwashed.
Mrs Shani Horowitz, originally from New York, moved to Hebron because she
wanted to live somewhere 'where by just sitting I was doing something for
the Jewish people.'
In passionate and often angry tones, she says the Hebron settlers are like
the early Jewish pioneers who built the state of Israel through settlement.
'Hebron is spiritually and geographically the centre of Jewish life. Because
we live here, Jews can come and visit the sites and holy places. We are the
messengers. We are sitting here for the rest of the country.
'Evacuating Hebron is like evacuating the Wailing Wall. Hebron is the second
most important Jewish city after Jerusalem. We are very much on the front
line, on a mission as soldiers. We are holding on tight to the land of
Israel. We are redeeming this place from being barren of Jews.'
The government's timid moves against the settlers has exposed the weakness
of Mr Rabin's political will. He fears that acting against the Hebron
settlers will fuel right-wing opposition to the peace process and force the
government into surrendering a powerful pawn in the drawn-out negotiation
with the Palestinians.
But the government's refusal clearly to state the long-term line of its
withdrawal from occupied Arab land has bound all 125,000 settlers together
in common cause with the Hebron settlers. The belief is that any move
against Hebron is the thin edge of the wedge. Most of the cabinet realise
that Hebron and some other settlements will have to be evacuated sooner or
later; the more the government delays, the more strongly organised the
settlers become.
Yesterday, hours before an anti-government demonstration, the Yesha council
of Jewish settlements said: 'It is inconceivable that a Jewish government
could make Hebron Judenrein (clean of Jews) ..The Rabin government has no
mandate for an 'ethnic cleansing' of Hebron or to carry out its policies of
capitulation (to the PLO).'
The settlers are preparing a campaign of fierce civil disobedience against
any effort to evacuate them. They have urged the army to disobey orders, and
implicitly threaten violence. 'If the government tries to evacuate Hebron it
will be a declaration of war against the Jewish people,' said Mr Noam Arnon,
a Hebron settler. 'We are not going to move. We are not going alive. They
will have kill us.'
Mr Arnon says settler leaders are calling for non-violence because they know
that violence damages their cause. But he warns that if the army leaves,
Hebron settlers will take up arms against the Arabs in a civil war. Jewish
law has a strong prohibition against Jewish-on-Jewish violence, but Mr Arnon
says that if the army tried to evacuate Hebron by force, 'with deep
emotional and religious feeling, people might lose self-control. Then,
horrible, terrible things might happen.'
With up to 15,000 army-issued automatic weapons in the settlers' hands, ten
of thousands of licensed handguns and the possibility of secret arms caches,
these are threats the government cannot take lightly. But the more the
government delays a political decision on settlements, the more the settlers
threaten the fragile peace process, and the stability of the government
itself.

Oxfam, the British charity, yesterday called for 'an open acknowledgment of
the scale of sub-Saharan Africa's development failure', Michael Holman
reports. World Bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed to
'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty,' it said.
Adjustment programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through
interest rates and unrealistic money supply targets'. Poorly-planned import
liberalisation measures' had 'exposed potentially competitive local
industries to ruinous competition from imports'. Oxfam accused the bank of
'complacency' in the face of Africa's 'deepening development crisis'.

said yesterday, Patrick Blum reports from Vienna. 'Restrictions were
applied, stopping us making some tests,' the IAEA said last night.
The team which spent 15 days in North Korea was able to visit all seven
declared nuclear facilities as agreed with Pyongyang last month. One of the
plants where the experts faced curbs was at the main nuclear complex at
Yongbyon, north of the capital. The team will report back this morning. A
formal IAEA board meeting could be called next week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strike over free political activity halted underground work at the Kloof
mine, one of South Africa's most profitable gold producers, for the second
day running yesterday. Kloof is responsible for about 5 per cent of the
country's gold output of 620 tonnes a year.
The strike, by 11,000 of the mine's 16,000 workforce, is the biggest in the
sector since 1991. It comes in the middle of a campaign by the National
Union of Mineworkers to win concessions from Gold Fields, Kloof's parent
company.
An NUM official said workers had given a list of grievances, including an
alleged ban on political activity on mine property. The union had not
received a response and this had led to the strike. A Gold Fields official
said the management had responded.
Gold Fields has before now declined to take part in the industry's wage
bargaining forum, unlike the rival mining houses Anglo American, Gencor,
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Randgold.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Mandela enters Bophuthatswana in triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MMABATHO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday made a
triumphal entry to the Bophuthatswana capital, Mmabatho, congratulating the
people of the black 'homeland' for ousting President Lucas Mangope, and
issuing a veiled warning that the same might happen to Zulu Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
Some 40,000 people cheered wildly as Mr Mandela entered the futuristic
'Independence Stadium' built to commemorate Bophuthatswana's granting of
independence from South Africa in 1977, a sovereignty which only Pretoria
recognised. He had harsh words for Chief Buthelezi, leader of the KwaZulu
black homeland, saying last week's events in Bophuthatswana would 'send a
signal' to him and to the white right-wing.
'The people have risen and tyrants have fallen. This message will not be
lost on people living under other toy tyrants in this country,' he said, a
comment which bordered on a direct invitation to the people of KwaZulu to
revolt. His remarks will not improve the political situation in Natal, where
at least nine people were killed yesterday in fighting between the ANC and
Chief Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party.
Nor do they improve prospects for the success of talks later this week
between Mr Mandela and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, aimed at ensuring
Inkatha's participation in the first all-race elections in April. The king
has strong links to Inkatha, through Chief Buthelezi, who is chief adviser
to the monarchy.
Mr Mandela denigrated the threat from Inkatha, saying he would suffer 'no
sleepless nights' over its promise to disrupt elections. The right wing, and
by implication Inkatha, were 'no more than those who bark without being able
to bite,' he said.
ANC leaders, who previously expressed grave concern at the right's ability
to disrupt elections, have gained confidence since armed right-wing whites
were chased out of Bophuthatswana on Friday, after briefly occupying the
capital. This new confidence is likely to undermine the ANC's commitment to
negotiate a deal to bring Inkatha, the only remaining party boycotting the
poll, into a constitutional settlement.
Mr Mandela arrived in Mmabatho yesterday morning to a low-key reception in
the streets, with very few people turning out to greet his motorcade. Later
in the day, the largest crowd ever seen for a public event in Bophuthatswana
turned out at the Independence Stadium, but it remained about a third empty.
The stadium, visible across many kilometres of the flat Bophuthatswana veld,
is widely seen as a symbol of President Mangope's rule: the upper sets of
seats are set at angles which form attractive silhouettes against the sky,
but make it impossible to see the pitch from anywhere but the central
stands.
Mr Mandela condemned looting that destroyed Mmabatho's shopping district,
but ANC officials made clear to business people an ANC government would not
compensate them for what officials implied was a necessary part of the
liberation struggle. Still, Indian business people, many of whom lost all
their stock, turned out to greet and garland the ANC leader. One Asian
businessman said after the meeting: 'The Indian community are jumping on the
bandwagon. They used to support Mangope, now they support Mandela.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Mahathir likely to gain control of Sabah assembly
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KOTA KINABALU, EAST MALAYSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The national front coalition government in Malaysia led by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad appears likely to assume power in the state of Sabah, East
Malaysia, after several members of the dominant local political party voiced
support for Dr Mahathir.
Sabah is one of only two states in the Malaysian federation not controlled
by parties in Dr Mahathir's national front. In bitterly fought state
elections last month the locally constituted Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), led
by Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the chief minister, narrowly defeated the
national front and retained its control of the Sabah assembly.
But in recent days PBS's majority has been threatened by a number of
defections by its assembly members to the national front. Yesterday Mr
Jeffrey Kitingan, a younger brother of the chief minister who was elected as
a PBS assemblyman in last month's elections, announced he was forming a
political party which would join Dr Mahathir's national front coalition.
Mr Jeffrey Kitingan, who was recently released after being detained for
three years on suspicion of wanting to take Sabah out of the Malaysian
federation, has said that Sabah could progress and develop through
membership of the national front.
Dr Mahathir has made no secret of his antagonism to the PBS and to Mr Pairin
Kitingan in particular. The PBS accuses Dr Mahathir of withholding federal
funding for Sabah's development and says the national front has paid
millions of dollars to win support of PBS assembly members.
The national front now seems certain to command a majority in the state
assembly, which is due to hold its first meeting on Friday since the recent
election. Earlier this week Mr Pairin Kitingan asked the Sabah governor to
dissolve the assembly and for new elections to be held.

The Swedish krona is likely to float for an extended period and remain

that European interest rates would continue to decline. 'Monetary policy is
unchanged in Europe despite the recent turbulence (in markets), which means
continued successive interest rate cuts.'

Spain should stop letting its citizens visit its museums free of charge
because the practice of only charging tourists is discriminatory, the
European Court of Justice ruled yesterday. Spaniards, foreigners living in
Spain and holidaymakers under 21 can visit any state museum free of charge,
but foreign tourists over 21 have to pay. The European Commission took the
Spanish government to court arguing it was breaking European law by
discriminating against people on the grounds of nationality. Charging
foreigners effectively restricted their freedom of movement since museums
were 'one of the determining reasons' tourists were attracted to a country,
the Commission said. Spain said it believed its open doors policy was not
discriminatory since it included some nationals from other EU states.

The importance of hedge funds to the financial markets has been exaggerated
in the recent debate over whether such funds should be regulated, according
to Mr Edgar Meister, a member of the Bundesbank board. The main wish of the
world's central bankers, including the Bundesbank, was for more transparency
to observe more carefully the impact of the growing derivative business on
the markets, specifically on market interest rates and on money supply, Mr
Meister said. Hedge funds were only one of several powerful forces
contributing to turbulence in the bond markets. There were also mutual
funds, banks and brokers, Mr Meister said. Private investors should be
calmed by the fact that the volatility in the capital markets was only
temporary. Germany did not face big credit risks on account of hedge funds
because the borrowing activity of such funds was regulated and limited in
Germany, unlike in the US, Mr Meister said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Government measures to stimulate the French motor industry have prompted a
strong response and should result in at least 150,000 extra car orders this
year, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, said yesterday. The measures
include a payment from the government of FFr5,000 (Dollars 870) for car
owners who trade in vehicles more than ten years old to buy a new one,
helping to prompt 54,000 extra orders in February compared with January,
according to Mr Longuet. He forecast continued improvement and estimated
that total car sales this year should exceed 1.9m, compared with 1.72m in
1993. The measures, which also include extra tax breaks for company fleets,
have been matched by discounts from car producers. French manufacturers have
benefited most, with Renault and Peugeot enjoying a stronger increase than
the average 35 per cent. Mr Longuet said it was vital to revive car sales,
which fell more than 18 per cent last year. Mr Longuet said that it was
vital to revive the depressed car sector, which was severely hit by
recession last year and contracted by more than 18 per cent. 'The automobile
sector is one of the principal motors of the economy and represents more
than one million jobs' he said. 'It is an ideal target to help stimulate
consumption.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / German retail sales edge up: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales in western Germany were 2 per cent higher in January than in
the same month last year. Sales in the whole of Germany were up 3 per cent,
2 per cent higher than in December. The increase was led by a 14 per cent
year-on-year rise in sales of cars and components. Pharmaceuticals sales
were up 11 per cent, and home furnishings 9 per cent. There was a 1 per cent
drop in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and a 4 per cent fall in textiles,
clothing and shoes. Overall economic activity in Germany 'increased
noticeably' around the turn of the year, the economics ministry said. The
ministry cited growing foreign demand, 'lively' housebuilding and 'further
clear progress' in eastern Germany's recovery as factors underlying this
resurgence.
Russia's industrial output rose 2.3 per cent in February from January, but
was 24.1 per cent below the level of a year earlier, the sharpest drop since
start of reforms in 1992. Some 4,280 enterprises shut down some or all
production last month.
Spanish industrial producer prices rose 1.1 per cent in January, compared
with a 0.2 per cent rise in December and 0.8 per cent in January 1993. The
monthly increase brings the rate for the year to 3.6 per cent in January.

government's first political test after presiding over a sharp fall in the
lira and a liquidity squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller must have told them their cheque
was in the post. That at least is how one observer explains the gloomy faces
of Turkish motorway contractors when they left a meeting with the prime
minister still owed seven months in payments.
After less than a year in office, Mrs Ciller's conservative-led coalition is
facing a desperate search for cash to meet its ongoing expenses.
It is a problem that will almost certainly affect the performance of Mrs
Ciller's Truth Path party (DYP) in municipal elections across the country on
March 27.
Turkey is in the middle of the most damaging financial crisis since the
banking collapse of the early 1980s. After a decade of capital market
reform, recent currency turbulence has underlined just how vulnerable the
economy is to policy error.
With interest rates on government paper having risen to 125 per cent and the
international bond markets for developing country debt suffering the jitters
in the wake of the rise in US rates, Turkey is finding it increasingly
costly to borrow. Privatisation receipts have not been as large as
projected. Meanwhile, most of the tax changes recently introduced will not
have an impact on revenues until 1995.
The government's problems deepened last week when it was forced to 'pull'
its Dollars 750m global bond issue. There are civil servants and public
works contractors to pay, farm prices to subsidise, and debts to service,
and bankers are worried a big liquidity crunch is on the way.
The road builders are just the latest creditors to come knocking on the
government's door. The contractors had to settle for a package of tax relief
and three-year bonds in lieu of the Dollars 700m owed for work completed.
The work programme for 1994 has been sharply curtailed.
The government's response to the crisis and the run on the lira has been far
from convincing. Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, during a
visit to Ankara last month, urged the Turkish authorities to introduce
austerity measures to underpin the gains from the 12 per cent devaluation in
January.
Instead Mrs Ciller set alarm bells ringing by suggesting Treasury bill
liabilities should be converted into new five-year paper, in effect a
domestic rescheduling.
What was puzzling was the Treasury's announcement that it is to issue
convertible bonds in the state telecom company, even though the telecom
company is still not privatised and all moves to prepare it for sale remain
blocked by the courts. There were even press reports, quoting government
officials, that undercover agents had been ordered to infiltrate the money
markets in the belief that it was Kurdish separatists who were trying to
destabilise them.
The crisis reflects the loss of local and international confidence in Mrs
Ciller's leadership. The bold rhetoric that accompanied her appointment has
never been matched by the reality of her policies. Her reformist instincts
have been frequently blocked by opposition from her coalition partners, the
Social Democratic Populists.
'Everyone has lost out,' said one disillusioned Turkish businessman.' The
central bank's reputation has been damaged, so has the Treasury's. Reserves
are depleted. And the small investor has got badly burnt.'
Polls suggest that in the municipal elections on March 27 Mrs Ciller's DYP
will limp in a poor fourth behind the Motherland party Anap, the main
opposition party, the Social Democratic Populists, and the Islamic based
Refah RP.
The election is the first real test of Mrs Ciller's popularity since she was
voted party leader by the DYP congress last June.
A professional economist and a political outsider, Mrs Ciller seemed to
offer the best hope of restoring the country's fortunes and forging its
western identity. Today if Mrs Ciller survives the current turmoil, it will
probably be less the result of any real political achievement than the fact
that the DYP is unable to find a credible alternative leader.
Her policies, centred on finding ways to finance the budget rather than
addressing the need to bring the deficit to heel, are attacked by leading
economists. Her attempts at more structural changes, such as pushing through
large-scale privatisation, tax reforms and curbing civil service pay rises,
have been limited because of divisions in her coalition and have done little
to ease budget pressures.
Also criticised has been her management style on which the resignations of
two successive central bank governors have been blamed. What was seen as her
mishandling of the 12 per cent devaluation in January badly dented the
bank's prestige. Moreover central bank reserves have fallen by as much as
Dollars 3bn since the beginning of the year to about Dollars 4.5bn early
this month.
Some bankers say Mrs Ciller has in large part brought the troubles on
herself. The local bond market has all but dried up as a direct result of
her unorthodox and ultimately failed attempt to push down domestic bill
rates. The current uncertainty has pushed rates on government paper up 30
points since the second half of 1993. Even at 125 per cent for one-year
paper, there are few buyers. As one banker put it: 'It's no longer enough to
have an interest rate policy. Something more is needed.'
After 7 per cent growth in 1993, forecasts for this year are being marked
down. One western economist says Turkey could see negative growth in 1994,
making it even more difficult for business to rebuild.
In such a climate, said one economist, bankruptcies would be unavoidable,
particularly for those dependent on government payments, such as
contractors. Banks too, will feel the pinch, caught out with large foreign
exchange exposure at a time when the lira's depreciation is accelerating.
Today Turkey displays all the symptoms of an economy where inflation is
heading out of control. No one wants to hold lira. On pay day, Turkish civil
servants rush to the exchange shops. Even divorces are sometimes settled in
hard currency.
Some foreign banks worry the lira could fall even more sharply unless a
serious structural reform programme is introduced.
Few Turkish observers hold out much hope of that in the current political
uncertainty.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Journalists strike in pensions protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian journalists yesterday began a four-day strike in protest over plans
by the Ciampi government to place some of the surplus in the journalists'
pension fund in the main state-operated pensions scheme.
The strike provoked dismay among political parties who have been relying on
the media for coverage in the final 11 days of the general election
campaign.
The stoppage will affect all newspapers today and Thursday, and television
and radio on the following two days.
The stoppage is the result of a long-running battle between the journalists
union and the government over the pension fund. As part of an effort to
boost the fast depleting coffers of the state-operated pension scheme, the
Ciampi governmment decided last year to raid the surpluses of separately
operated, but state-run entities, controlling the pensions of the various
professions.
The strike comes as Italian journalists have for the first time come under
investigation for corruption. Three prominent economic writers are being
investigated by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving money from the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group.
The investigations follow revelations by Mr Carlo Sama, the former managing
director of Ferruzzi-Montedison who has admitted large-scale illicit funding
of poltiical parties.
Mr Sama said he had submitted to Milan magistrates the names of several
journalists who had been paid sums of money to help improve
Ferruzzi-Montedison's image.
The journalists deny the allegations. They are Mr Giuseppe Turani, of La
Repubblica, Mr Osvaldo De Paolini, former City editor of the business daily
Sole-24 Ore, and Mr Ugo Bertone of La Stampa.
Italian journalism has claimed much credit for exposing the corrupt links
between business and politics.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Merchant bankers brave disdain of Athens: The Greek
socialists know they must pay the price as telecom sell-off brings back the
fee seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Undeterred by Greece's failure last year to carry out a planned partial
flotation of the state telecommunications company, OTE, western investment
bankers are pushing back into Athens for another try.
With the socialist government committed to relaunching its conservative
predecessor's privatisation programme, to help cover a rapidly widening
budget deficit, the sale of 25 per cent of OTE is being set provisionally
for October.
However, plans for the flotation are still vague, not least because the
socialists, after their election victory last year, sacked the previous
government's two leading advisers on privatisation, N M Rothschild and
Credit Suisse First Boston, without appointing a replacement.
Moreover, in the absence of Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, the economy minister, who
is undergoing treatment for cancer, the prime minister, Mr Andreas
Papandreou, has not indicated who will be responsible for awarding the
mandate for the OTE sale.
It will be a delicate political decision, given the opposition to the sale
voiced by OTE's powerful trade union, and a prevailing mood of hostility
towards foreign investment bankers within the ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (Pasok).
A senior socialist official said: 'We're naive perhaps, but we were shocked
at the size of the fees the conservatives were prepared to pay to foreign
consultants.'
Both Rothschilds and CSFB were advising the previous government on its plan
to sell a 35 per cent strategic stake in OTE to an international operator.
In addition, CSFB and J Henry Schroder Wagg were appointed global
co-ordinators for the flotation of another 14 per cent of the company on the
Athens stock exchange, expected to raise about Dr100bn (Pounds 274m).
Rothschilds, together with Morgan Stanley and Paribas, were originally
appointed joint lead managers of the offering's international tranche. But
both the sale and flotation were cancelled when the conservatives lost power
in the general election last year.
The socialists' disdain for international advisers extended to firing Arthur
Andersen, the accountants, who were preparing OTE's first audit up to
international standards.
They are to be replaced by auditors from SOL, a quasi-government body of
Greek-sworn accountants.
Nevertheless, economy ministry officials now accept the need to appoint an
international bank as co-ordinator to ensure the success of what will be the
largest local offering to date.
However, the ministry is already admitting that political criteria will
affect the final choice. 'Obviously, we can't reappoint the old team, even
though a few players may be asked to participate again,' a government
adviser said.
Almost all the banks previously involved have submitted fresh proposals.
However, confidence is strong among newcomers, among them Bear Stearns,
Lehman Brothers, Barings and Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The government hopes to realise Dr250bn from the OTE sale, with up to 60 per
cent of the issue being placed abroad.
'They appear to be counting on the current appetite for telecoms issues
among international investors to offset delays in restructuring
old-fashioned management and a lack of transparency in the accounts,' said
one analyst.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Exports boost for engineering sector in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Export growth will help Germany's engineering industry increase sales by 2
per cent this year. But a further 100,000 jobs will have to go, and a
sustained recovery will not emerge until 1995 and 1996, according to the
VDMA industry association.
Stronger growth was not possible because of weak domestic demand, and the
industry's average net return on sales of less than 1 per cent was too low
to finance investment, modernisation and new jobs, Mr Jan Kleinewefers,
association president, said.
Growing demand from outside Europe for German machines had been apparent for
a year, and in the past two months there had been signs of a change for the
better in west European orders, which were no longer slowing, he said.
However, average capacity utilisation was still at a record low of 75.6 per
cent at the end of last year. Only four sectors - steel plant, textile,
packaging and woodworking machinery - were working at satisfactory rates of
85 per cent or more. Highlights of last year - the worst since the war, and
marred by a 11 per cent slump in industry-wide sales to DM209bn (Pounds
81.3bn) - included a 10 per cent increase in sales to the US, Mr
Kleinewefers said. The US was now the industry's biggest single foreign
market. Exports to China doubled to DM4bn, helping bolster sales to east
Asia by 15 per cent. However, domestic orders fell a real 15 per cent, and a
drop of 13 per cent in demand from other European Union countries meant
total foreign orders rose only 1 per cent.
Turnover from export deliveries fell a real 7 per cent to DM110bn, but
machinery imports also shrank 12 per cent, leaving the sector showing a
trading surplus of more than DM50bn. Between the onset of the recession in
1990 and the end of last year, the plant and machinery industries - second
only in terms of sales to the automotive sector - had seen output fall by 20
per cent. Some 200,000 jobs had been lost in the west of the country.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia will not only cut grain imports to a minimum this year, but intends
to export 2m tonnes, the deputy agriculture minister, Mr Vladimir Shcherbak,
told a government commission meeting, Reuter reports from Moscow.
RIA news agency quoted him as saying domestic supplies were sufficient to
meet most demand, but there would still have to be some small imports of
certain types of grain.
These should include 100,000 tonnes of corn seed, already covered by
preliminary agreements and waiting in western ports to be delivered, Mr
Shcherbak said. But foreign companies were seeking finance ministry payment
guarantees before making shipments, and the agreements could still fall
through, he said.
Russia imported about 11m tonnes of grain in 1993, down from 25m tonnes in
the previous year.
Mr Shcherbak gave no details of the planned exports.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Brussels to keep close eye on telecom ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday served notice that it intends take a more
active role in policing joint ventures in the fast growing
telecommunications market.
Mr Philip Lowe, head of the Commission's merger task force, said the
Brussels authorities would be looking closely at industry proposals for
co-operation which might restrict competition. He told the Brussels
Telecommunications Forum that technology was moving so fast that it was
outstripping decision-makers and posing a challenge to regulators. 'Frankly,
we have to watch it.'
Mr Lowe predicted the European Union would have to accelerate its agreed
timetable for liberalising national markets for voice telephony from
January, 1998 - a view shared widely inside the Commission.
Mr Lowe's speech provided the first clues on future regulatory policy in
telecoms, a booming market which could see most of Europe's state companies
privatised before the end of the century.
Mr Lowe suggested two areas where the competition directorate would either
extend its powers or 'clarify' existing jurisdiction:
Lowering the thresholds above which Brussels automatically vet deals, from
Ecu250m (Pounds 189m) annual turnover in the EU market to Ecu100m. This is a
long-standing Commission goal; but Mr Lowe said telecom ventures usually
started with a low turnover but could grow very quickly into big players.
Examining the definition of industrial 'co-operation'. Joint ventures may
not amount to market concentration but they could still restrict
competition, Mr Lowe suggested.
In the past year, the directorate's merger task force has vetted 10 cases
involving telecoms operators, including a British Telecom proposal to
provide valued added services with MCI, the US telecoms company. Overall, it
looked at 200 cases in all industrial sectors.
In one case, Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, withdrew a proposal for a
joint venture with Siemens for an optical fibre cable project.
Mr Lowe reminded industry of the advantages of dealing with Brussels
competition authorities. Takeovers of a certain size are automatically
investigated within a month.
Where serious doubts exist about their effect on competition, they are
subject to a four-month inquiry. Separately, companies considering joint
ventures or mergers can seek informal guidance.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Russia to raise tariffs on range of imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure from Russia's powerful industrial and agricultural lobbies, coupled
with fears of rapidly falling government income, have persuaded the
government to bring in sweeping new import tariffs.
The tariffs, the subject of several decrees not yet published, are reported
by the Interfax news agency to raise the average tariffs from 6-7 per cent
to 15 per cent.
All imported food will be subject to a 15 per cent tax, while white sugar
will carry a 20 per cent tariff and cigarettes a 30 per cent import tax.
Tariffs on cars and perfume will also go up sharply: the changes will mean
that foreign cars will carry a tax of between 40-60 per cent.
The move appears to mark a success for Mr Alexander Zaveryukha, the deputy
premier with responsibility for agriculture, who had argued for a 25 per
cent rise in white sugar prices to protect domestic producers. At the same
time, however, tariffs on imported spare parts needed to re-tool industry
have fallen to 5 per cent.
The other main reason for the increase in tariffs is the rapidly decline in
government incomes, with the take from taxes running at little over half of
what was expected. The shift to tax foodstuffs which are bought largely by
the minority of wealthy Russians and the foreign community who buy at
largely foreign-owned shops can be put through with a minimum of political
pain.
At the same time, the choice of goods which are subject to the new tariffs
shows that the government has not abandoned itself to wholesale
protectionism, leaving large sectors unprotected and imposing on only a very
few commodities - weapons, caviar, matches and concentrated alcohol - a 100
per cent tariff increase.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Portuguese take on banks: Consumers boycott debit cards in
protest against surcharge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's hard-pressed consumers took on the country's big banks yesterday
 -organising a 24-hour boycott of their widely used direct debit cards in
protest at an attempt by the banks to charge commission on use of the cards.
They were responding to an angry appeal by consumer associations,
supermarket chains, petrol stations and other businesses to protest against
a decision by banks to charge a commission of 1 per cent on purchases made
with the cards.
Shop owners said banks would earn Esc8bn (Pounds 30.7m) to Esc10bn a year
from the charge, due to be levied from April. They warned they would be
forced to pass on the extra cost to consumers because retail profit margins
were already low.
The Multibanco card system in Portugal, considered the most advanced in
Europe, allows consumers to shop, pay utility bills, dine out and book train
tickets without using cash or cheques. The cost is immediately debited from
their bank accounts and paid into the account of the supplier.
The system, run by Sociedade Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) for almost all
Portuguese banks, provides 3,000 automatic teller machines countrywide where
cardholders can withdraw and deposit money, consult their accounts, and
order cheque books. Retail outlets are equipped with 30,000 electronic
points of sale (Epos) integrated into the system.
'We will take the banks to court for operating a cartel,' said Mr Jorge
Morgado of the Deco consumer association that led the call for a boycott.
'They all plan to introduce the same charge at the same time without
offering consumers any choice.'
Mr Luis Cid, SIBS director, said it was natural that banks should seek to
regain operational costs through a charge for a service that has been free
since it was introduced in 1985. Three years ago British consultants
estimated each Multibanco operation cost Es100, considerably less than the
cost of processing a cheque.
The decision to levy a charge on card use comes as falling interest rates
are sharply reducing earnings from loans and deposits and banks are seeking
to improve their balance sheets through commissions and fee-based income.
However, the use of cards has allowed banks to reduce staff levels. It has
also improved services for customers, who until recently had to wait in long
queues for the simplest of banking services.
'We want banks to be flooded with cheques as a result of the boycott to
remind them of what a boon the Multibanco system has been to them,' said Mr
Morgado. He said Deco had been overwhelmed by messages of support and
challenged a statement from SIBS that use of the Multibanco system yesterday
was normal or even above average.
Paying for his lunch yesterday with cash instead of a card as usual, Mr
Paulo Garcia, a computer engineer said: 'The banks have enticed us into the
Multibanco system over the past eight years by levying no charges. 'Now they
want us to pay. I support the boycott and will stop using my card for
purchases altogether if they go ahead with the charge.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / SPD election victor puts party on alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A supremely self-assured Mr Gerhard Schroder, the victorious Social Democrat
prime minister in the state of Lower Saxony, swept into Bonn yesterday to
warn his party colleagues against over-confidence in their own coming
election campaigns.
It was a moment of vindication for Mr Schroder, who was defeated last year
in the contest to become national leader of the Social Democratic party
(SPD) by the altogether more modest Mr Rudolf Scharping, the state premier
of the Rhineland-Palatinate.
This time he was coming back as a winner from the very first poll of
Germany's 1994 election marathon, which will see 18 more polls culminating
in the general election on October 16.
His emergence from Sunday's state election in Lower Saxony with an absolute
majority - albeit only of one seat - means that he can rule without any
coalition partner. That is a luxury enjoyed by the government in only five
other states of the 16 in the federal republic.
Mr Schroder was magnanimous in his victory. He paid tribute to the Greens
who had been his partners in the first red-green coalition in Germany, and
will undoubtedly still be needed to provide some support for his wafer-thin
majority. At the end of Sunday night, his SPD had won 81 of the 161 seats in
the Hanover-based state parliament, against 67 for the Christian Democratic
Union, and 13 for the Greens.
The biggest losers were the Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU, which lost 5.6
percentage points to win just 36.4 per cent of the vote, and the Free
Democratic Party (FDP), his coalition partner in Bonn, which failed to gain
the minimum 5 per cent needed to win any seats at all.
Yet Mr Schroder's main warning was to his own SPD party colleagues, not to
relax in the forthcoming election campaigns and regard them as good as won.
And he spoke out strongly against national policies which might prove
disastrous vote-losers in the campaign, such as a national speed limit on
the autobahns, and an increase in taxes on petrol and oil products.
Mr Schroder, whose victory is seen very much as a personal triumph, admitted
he was facing an exhausted CDU in Lower Saxony, with a serious shortage of
personalities in its leadership.
Yet one man had shown he could make a difference in the last two weeks of
the campaign, he said: the arrival of Mr Kohl himself showed that the ruling
party could still boast 'a notable and battle-hardened election campaigner'
who should never be under-estimated.
It was no doubt a neat reminder to his erstwhile SPD rival, Mr Scharping,
about the harsh struggle ahead. Mr Schroder pledged his loyal support to his
national leader, but he firmly ruled out any future role in Bonn for
himself.
He was speaking just five days before the next test in the election
marathon, when 2.1m voters in the state of Schleswig-Holstein must elect new
local councils on Sunday - and where the SPD itself is facing a backlash in
the polls.
State officials of the CDU are hoping to push the SPD into second place and
to emerge once again as the largest party, reversing the positions of 1990.
The biggest loser from the Lower Saxony election was the Free Democratic
party, which failed to gain even the minimum 5 per cent needed to win seats
in the state parliament.
And in spite of its loss of power in the coalition, the biggest winner was
the Green party, which pushed up its vote from 5.5 to 7.4 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Balladur settles feud on defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has settled a feud between his defence and
budget ministers over future military expenditure by deciding that armaments
spending should rise annually by 0.5 per cent in real terms until the end of
the century.
Mr Balladur engineered the compromise as the government prepares to present
to parliament next month the 1995-2000 military framework law. This does not
absolutely tie a government's hands over annual defence budgets, but since
France is likely next year to elect a president from the ranks of the
governing coalition - even perhaps Mr Balladur - it will be a good guide to
future defence spending.
Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, had pushed for a rise in military
equipment spending of 2.5-3 per cent a year, taking as his text the recent
government-approved defence white paper. It said real 'annual growth of at
least 3 per cent' was needed to fund all programmes underway, though it
acknowledged greater efforts could be made to keep arms suppliers' charges
down and foresaw some savings through 'a certain pause' in modernising
France's nuclear deterrent.
Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, the budget minister, argued that the armed forces
should be subject to the same financial discipline as the civil sector. The
government's five-year fiscal programme, designed to fit France to enter
monetary union with Germany and other European partners by the late 1990s,
calls for an average 0.4 per cent cut in public spending in each of the next
three years.
Mr Balladur's decision to allow arms spending to continue to rise modestly
will appease the strong defence lobby inside the government coalition, but
will mean more severe cuts in civil programmes. France's 1994 defence
equipment budget of FFr100.4bn (Pounds 11.5bn) is already higher than that
of other European allies, with Britain planning to spend about 60 per cent -
and Germany only 27 per cent - of the French level this year, according to
French defence officials.
President Mitterrand's two-year old moratorium on French nuclear tests in
the south Pacific has provoked strong complaints from within the government
majority, but without saving much money because the government has started
research into laboratory simulation of such tests. The Elysee yesterday
welcomed President Clinton's decision to prolong until autumn 1995 a similar
moratorium.
Another general drain on the defence budget has come from France's heavy
involvement in United Nations peace-keeping operations in ex-Yugoslavia and
elsewhere. Last year this cost France FFr7bn, of which only FFr1.5bn will be
reimbursed by the UN.
The German government yesterday approved new guidelines for the armed forces
which call for the build-up of rapid-reaction forces under Nato's post-cold
war strategy of crisis management, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The guidelines, laid down in a policy document to be published next month,
spell out Germany's new international role after unification and detail
changes in the military force structure. 'This is the first building block
of the future Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces),' Mr Volker Ruhe, defence
minister, said. There were instances in international crisis management
where 'military means are necessary to prevent, limit or end violence,' he
said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / German town angered by new Iron Curtain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The euphoria in the eastern German town of Hotensleben, some 185km west of
Berlin, when the Iron Curtain was dismantled has turned to amazement and
anger since their local leaders decided to rebuild part of it as a monument
to the cold war, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Eager to halt the decline of Hotensleben since German unification, a small
group of civic dignitaries last year began rebuilding a 330-metre (1,080ft)
section of the 'death strip' which kept east Germans from escaping to the
west. Hoping to slow a sharp rise in unemployment and reverse a demoralising
westward migration of many of its 2,600 citizens, they decided to capitalise
on the town's isolated location during the cold war with a unique tourist
attraction.
They have spent DM135,000 (Pounds 52,500) - some of it government money - to
repair and rebuild it, complete with guard towers, spotlights and attack
dogs.
'It's pure insanity,' said Dr Franz Wehe, a retired surgeon who lives next
to the rebuilt wall. 'That damn thing was here for 30 years so why do we
have to look at it now?' Nearly 500 people in Hotensleben have signed
petitions protesting against the monument.
The monument was to have been completed by 1996 but the protests brought a
quick halt to federal funding. Annoyed and undaunted, the proponents are
seeking DM300,000 in private funding to complete the monument.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Microsoft reorganises to meet market challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft of the US, the world's largest personal computer software company,
yesterday announced a worldwide reorganisation to improve decision making
and market responsiveness.
It said the new structure was necessary to achieve its goal of doubling
sales over the next four years. Last year the company had net income of
Dollars 953m (Pounds 652m) on sales of Dollars 3.75bn.
Microsoft says the reorganisation will not lead to job losses, in contrast
to the experience of other computer companies. 'It will not reduce our
overall headcount, but it will allow us to grow without increasing our head
count as much as our current organisation would require,' the company said.
A memorandum sent to employees says the company could seize 'incredible
opportunities' in the next few years, but implies that competitors,
including Lotus and Novell, are superior in sales and marketing: 'We cannot
just follow and react to what others are doing.'
Restructuring is expected to take between two and three months, with all the
key elements in place before the start of Microsoft's new financial year in
the autumn.
The company denied the reorganisation was a response to an investigation of
its business practices being carried out by the US Justice Department. Last
year, the US Federal Trade Commission failed to agree whether to proceed
against the software company after more than three years of investigation
into whether Microsoft had abused its position as market leader.
Microsoft, boosted by sales of MS-Dos and Windows personal computer
operating software, has shown quarterly earnings growth of between 25 and 55
per cent in recent years. In the first quarter of the current year, however,
growth slowed to 14 per cent. Analysts suggested the company was maturing
and rivals were eating into its market share.
The reorganisation is designed to accelerate decision-making, simplify
marketing messages to customers and business partners and improve
efficiency. Seven product groups are to be created to cover, for example,
personal operating systems and desktop applications. New customer units will
be responsible for individual users, organisations and companies which build
Microsoft software into their own products.
Microsoft believes central Europe could become its single largest market,
with the potential of Dollars 1bn in yearly sales.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Britain blocks agreement on EU voting rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union foreign ministers failed last night to break a deadlock over
voting rights in an expanded union after the UK held out for yet another
meeting to settle the issue.
The 12 are expected to resume talks in Brussels next Tuesday but angry
ministers said they had in effect given the UK and Spain an ultimatum on the
voting rights issue and were not prepared to make any further concessions.
The UK and Spain are resisting any dilution of their right to block
decisions in the EU Council of Ministers when Austria, Finland, Norway and
Sweden join the EU next year.
Senior negotiators said Britain and Spain had been offered a compromise
solution which would allow them to delay decisions to which they objected.
But they made clear there could be no question of a small minority of EU
states indefinitely holding up decisions.
Mr Jacques Poos, the Luxembourg foreign minister, said last night the
ministers had settled membership terms for Norway after resolving a row over
fishing rights, putting even more pressure on the UK and Spain to reach an
agreement. Entry terms for Finland, Sweden and Austria have already been
agreed.
The EU foreign ministers' meeting next Tuesday would be their fourth attempt
to resolve the crisis over enlargement of the Union to 16.
'Positions have hardened rather than moved closer together,' said Mr Alain
Lamassoure, French European Affairs Minister. There are fears that further
delay on the voting rights dispute might sink the chances of the four
newcomers joining the EU in January as planned.
A senior British government official made clear yesterday that the UK could
not yet work its way around the voting rights dispute, which it acknowledges
may jeopardise prospects for the 'wider Europe' London says it espouses.
'You have to realise how (any weakening of UK veto rights) could play in
Westminster' among rightwing, Europhobic members of the British parliament,
the official said.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the powerful Tory backbench Finance Committee,
said opposition to watering down Britain's rights was spread right across
the party. 'This is a case of blackmail, to put it bluntly. The Commission
is proposing watering down voting rights to have enlargement of the
Community.'
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, asked in parliament to clarify the
government's negotiating position at the foreign ministers' meeting, said:
'What we need to ensure is that democratic legitimacy and the rights of
minorities are sustained within the European Union.'
One rightwing backbencher said privately: 'The prime minister has been told
that he risks his majority in the Commons if he allows the Foreign Office to
agree to any compromise over our blocking veto.'
In Brussels, enormous pressure was placed on the British, including calls
for a vote that would expose them as the obstacle preventing the move from a
Europe of 12 to 16.
The UK wants to change the proportion of weighted votes in the Council of
Ministers needed to block EU laws. Currently, 30 per cent of the votes can
form a 'blocking minority'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Further Dollars 1.5bn loan urged for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Group of Seven leading industrial countries, fearful that the Russian
economy may collapse, are pressing the International Monetary Fund to agree
to lend the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of funds aimed at assisting reform.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, is expected in Moscow tomorrow.
During his five-day visit he will have to decide whether to recommend to the
fund's board to pay the second tranche of the systemic transformation
facility. If he recommends delay, factors in his decision will be fears that
the budget will not be adhered to and that inflation - down to a monthly 9
per cent in February - will again soar, as expected.
A continued fall in production and the huge indebtedness in Russian industry
have meant that government income is running at half of the budgeted figures
for the first two months of this year.
Meanwhile, powerful lobbies, especially the military, are demanding higher
allocations than presently allowed. General Pavel Grachev, defence minister,
says that his troops will go unfed unless the allocation to defence of
Rbs37,000bn (Pounds 14.4bn) for this year is more than doubled.
One senior western financial expert in Moscow said yesterday: 'The base to
support the infrastructure of the country is shrinking and at some point
soon you will not have enough resources to support the minimum services.'
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, has sought to impress on the IMF
that he and his senior colleagues are at least as pro-market as radicals
such as Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, who left the cabinet this
year. An IMF team is negotiating with Russian ministers in Moscow.
Mr Chernomyrdin has drawn up a list of companies to be declared bankrupt,
has enthusiastically endorsed the sell-off of state and collective farms to
individuals, and says he will repel all advances from the military,
industrial, energy and agricultural lobbies for more credits.
However, he has also tried to make clear to the IMF the severity of the
crisis he faces. The draft budget envisages expenditure of Rbs183,000bn and
income of about Rbs120,000bn - leaving a budget deficit of about 10 per cent
of gross national product, a figure regarded as tight in present
circumstances. The draft has not yet gone to the lower house of parliament
for ratification.

FT  16 MAR 94 / High street spending slows as tax rise nears: CBI survey
shows second month of weak retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales growth slowed for the second month in succession in February as
consumers restrained their spending ahead of next month's tax increases.
The Confederation of British Industry said its new distributive trades
survey confirmed that unimpressive sales in January were more than a 'flash
in the pan'. The data showed that last month retailers reported the lowest
year-on-year increase in sales since volumes started to rise in January
1993.
The weakness of consumer demand suggested by the survey may increase
pressure on the government to ease interest rates, particularly if today's
official retail sales and unemployment figures confirm the gloomy picture.
However, other figures yesterday pointed to robustness in the UK building
industry. Construction orders won by contractors were 30 per cent higher in
the three months to January 31 than in the corresponding period 12 months
earlier.
The figures, published by the Department of the Environment, indicated that
the upsurge in orders since the autumn was continuing, providing further
evidence that the recession in the industry might be coming to an end.
The CBI said it was not particularly concerned by the slowdown in retail
sales growth. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the confederation's
distributive trades panel, said this trend probably reflected the fact that
some consumers were anticipating the impact of the tax increases which are
due to take effect in April.
'Equally, other consumers may also be holding back until they are sure just
how much their pay packets will be affected,' he said.
Retailers were confident that they would 'weather the storm' of tax
increases. Mr Whittaker said: 'It will cause a bit of a blip for a month or
two. But the underlying trends suggest we are going to emerge from it in a
satisfactory way.'
Overall, 40 per cent of retailers surveyed said that business was higher
than it was in February 1993, while 30 per cent said it was lower. The 10
per cent balance between the two figures compared with a positive balance of
15 per cent in January, and was the smallest since January 1993.
Only 16 per cent of retailers surveyed said sales were good for the time of
year, while twice as many - 33 per cent - thought they were poor. The
balance of minus 17 per cent represents a further decline since January,
when the balance was minus 15 per cent.
Inflation continues to show few signs of picking up, according to the
survey. A positive balance of 20 per cent of retailers reported that prices
were up on 12 months earlier. With the exception of January's balance, that
was the weakest price trend reported since the survey began in 1983.
The survey also showed that imports were increasing their presence in
British shops. The CBI said the proportion of deliveries from suppliers
accounted for by imports increased in the year to January. A positive
balance of 1 per cent in January rose to 7 per cent in February.

FT  16 MAR 94 / EU expansion talks face collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Talks among European Union foreign ministers to settle the row over
power-sharing if the 12 take in four new members next year were on the verge
of collapse last night, with the UK holding out for yet another meeting to
settle the issue.
Any further delay on the voting rights dispute might sink chances of
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden joining the EU next January as planned,
and brake the momentum behind the Union's expansion.
The UK, which with Spain is resisting any dilution of its right to block
decisions in the EU Council of Ministers, predicted last night that further
negotiation would be needed - possibly at a summit of European leaders.
A senior British government official said: 'There will be another meeting,
but we don't know the level, the time or the place.' But he made clear that
the government could not yet work its way around the voting rights dispute,
which it acknowledges may sabotage prospects for the 'wider Europe' London
says it espouses.
'You have to realise how (any weakening of UK veto rights) could play in
Westminster' among rightwing, Europhobic members of the British parliament,
the official said.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the powerful Tory backbench Finance Committee,
said opposition to watering down Britain's rights was spread right across
the party. 'This is a case of blackmail, to put it bluntly. The Commission
is proposing watering down voting rights to have enlargement of the
Community.'
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, asked in parliament to clarify the
government's negotiating position at the foreign ministers' meeting, said:
'What we need to ensure is that democratic legitimacy and the rights of
minorities are sustained within the European Union.'
One rightwing backbencher said privately: 'The prime minister has been told
that he risks his majority in the Commons if he allows the Foreign Office to
agree to any compromise over our blocking veto.'
However, Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, predicted that
there would be no revolt by Conservative Euro-sceptics over UK voting rights
in Europe.
In Brussels, enormous pressure was being placed on the British, including
calls for a vote that would expose them - and the Spanish if they do not
climb down - as the obstacles to the move from a Europe of 12 to 16.
Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark all suggested that those who
opposed the will of the EU majority on how to manage this first stage of the
Union expansion should 'go away and reflect', as Mr Niels Helveg Petersen,
Danish foreign minister, put it.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, asked the British
to stop wasting time. 'The final result is not in doubt. The sooner they
realise that, the better.'
The UK wants to change the proportion of weighted votes in the Council of
Ministers needed to block EU laws and regulations. Currently, 30 per cent of
the votes - distributed roughly according to size among member states - can
form a 'blocking minority'.
Arithmetically, the UK and Spain's partners argue that that means the
present arrangement of 23 votes out of 76 should move to 27 out of 90 once
the Nordic and Alpine countries come in.
Spain is happy to see the blocking threshold raised to 27 votes, but under
conditions.

FT  16 MAR 94 / G7 urges IMF to release Dollars 1.5bn for Russian reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Group of Seven leading industrial countries, fearful that the Russian
economy may collapse, are pressing the International Monetary Fund to agree
to lend the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of funds aimed at assisting reform.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, is expected in Moscow tomorrow.
During his five-day visit he will have to decide whether to recommend to the
fund's board to pay the second tranche of the systemic transformation
facility or again delay payment because of fears that the budget will not be
adhered to and that inflation - down to a monthly 9 per cent in February -
will again soar, as expected.
A continued fall in production and the huge indebtedness in Russian industry
have meant that government income is running at half of the budgeted figures
for the first two months of this year.
Meanwhile, powerful lobbies, especially the military, are demanding higher
allocations than the present budget allows - with General Pavel Grachev,
defence minister, warning that his troops will go unfed unless the
allocation to defence of Rbs37,000bn (Pounds 14.4bn) for this year is more
than doubled.
One senior western financial expert in Moscow said yesterday: 'The base to
support the infrastructure of the country is shrinking and at some point
soon you will not have enough resources to support the minimum services.'
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister. has sought to impress on the IMF -
which has a team negotiating with Russian ministers in Moscow - that he and
senior colleagues are at least as pro-market as radicals such as Mr Yegor
Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, who left the cabinet this year.
The G7 countries had relaxed their pressure on the IMF and the other
international financial institutions such as the World Bank to lend to
Russia after the December elections, as the outcome led them to believe that
further reform was unlikely.
Mr Chernomyrdin has drawn up a list of companies to be declared bankrupt,
has enthusiastically endorsed the sell-off of state and collective farms to
individuals, and says he will repel all advances from the
military,industrial, energy and agricultural lobbies for more credits.
However, he has also tried to make clear to the IMF the severity of the
crisis he faces. The draft budget - which has not yet gone to the state
duma, or lower house of parliament, for the required ratification  -
envisages expenditure of Rbs183,000bn and income of about Rbs120,000bn -
leaving a budget deficit of about 10 per cent of gross national product, a
figure generally regarded as tight in present circumstances.
The income, however, is proving wildly optimistic. Government insiders said
yesterday that government income, mainly from taxes, was running at only
some Rbs70,000bn to Rbs80,000bn a year.

Tax Havens and Their Uses
by Caroline Doggart
Economist Intelligence Unit, Pounds 75
183 pages
Bjorn Borg and Boris Becker do it in Monaco; Anthony Burgess and Alistair
MacLean do it - or did it - in Switzerland; Arthur C. Clarke does it in Sri
Lanka.
Many well-known personalities are among those heading to sunny tax shelters,
but potential new fugitives should think carefully before they begin to pack
their bags. Things are changing rapidly in the world's tax havens, and those
who are caught out could be badly burnt.
'No amount of tax savings can make up for a life of loneliness and a lack of
affinity with foreign surroundings,' warns Caroline Doggart, in her survey
of offshore centres. And those that change their minds can be heavily
penalised if they make the wrong choice and move back home.
This guide - written in a very clear style reminiscent of The Economist -
offers an excellent introduction to the subject, which avoids jargon or
excessive technical detail. It provides a useful trot through the range of
tax-haven topics, including their history, company registration, personal
and corporation income tax and the relationship with other tax authorities.
There is also an important and lighthearted  - if somewhat superficial -
discussion of the lifestyle in the different havens. It does perhaps appear
to veer slightly too sympathetically towards tax flee-ers rather than tax
collectors.
Switzerland, it seems, was the world's first tax haven. Campione, on the
border of Switzerland and Italy, has become one by default since both
nations abdicated their fiscal responsibilities for the region. Minerva,
between Tonga and Fiji, was mooted recently as the world's only underwater
retreat. Albania and North Korea lack income tax but also, warns Doggart,
lack amenities. There is no tax on Ascension Island and just 4 per cent on
Norway's Svalbard Islands. But, as an official feasibility study for the
Falklands Islands concluded, havens in warmer climates have a distinct
advantage.
Doggart includes on her list some surprising candidates: France and Italy in
Europe, on some grounds; and even the US for many Europeans, because of its
comparatively low federal tax rates - even after US President Clinton's
latest rise.
Powers of investigation by tax authorities vary greatly. The US Internal
Revenue Service is particularly zealous in hunting down tax evaders. France,
India and the US all offer statutory awards for informers.
Eastern Europe is now beginning to get in on the act, with Hungary offering
a high degree of banking secrecy. By contrast, Switzerland's wall of secrecy
has now been pierced so frequently, says Doggart, that it is more like
Gruyere than granite.
Readers may sometimes find the structure of the report - based around themes
rather than countries - a little irritating if they are gathering
information on a single location. In compensation, the whole document is
sufficiently short and lucid to be skimmed through quickly.
Some of the examples mentioned are also beginning to look a little dated.
The UK Inland Revenue's penchant for dawn raids, for example, might have
been better illustrated by that on Nissan in 1991, rather than Rossminster
in 1979.
Because it is heavily oriented towards practical advice, the report fails to
pull out wider themes. It would have been useful to read more about the
changing pressures on havens, and what future they have as the trends in the
burden and collection of tax around the world have shifted. But, as Doggart
says, havens will continue as long as governments impose new and burdensome
tax legislation. So, too, no doubt, will guides like this.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (27): Withering away, but not as
Lenin expected - David Lubin on essays which highlight the fate of the state
over the past decade, and question the market's value for developing
countries / Economics

Market Forces and World Development
edited by Rene Prendergast and Frances Stewart
St Martin's Press (distributed by Macmillan), Pounds 45
217 pages
Angel Gurria, the Mexican finance official who steered his country through
the debt crisis of the 1980s, is fond of making a neat rhyme by describing
Mexico's economic reforms as a series of shuns: privatisashun, trade
liberalisashun, deregulashun and fiscal consolidashun.
For most developing countries, these policies - and the underlying belief
that the market provides the most reliable way of allocating resources in an
economy - have acquired the status of an unimpeachable conventional wisdom.
In the third world's more or less open-armed embrace of market forces, the
biggest loser of all has been the state, whose former prominence in economic
decision-making has been pretty thoroughly undermined.
Ironically, Lenin's catchy prediction - that the state would wither away -
is apparently being proved right, albeit not quite in the way envisaged.
Here is a book that draws attention to the state's miserable fate over the
past decade or so. Most of its 11 essays try to poke holes in the argument
that the market necessarily delivers the best possible results for
developing countries. Some of the authors do this by relying on economic
theory; others do it by looking at some of the bad side-effects of the
'adjustment' process, hoping to show that something must be wrong with
economic policies that frequently leave the most disadvantaged groups in a
society worse off than before.
The best of the theory-laden essays is a provocative but jargon-filled
effort by Peter Smith, who challenges the idea that any step towards a
market-based solution must be better than nothing. One of the biggest
problems he sees is that the arguments in favour of the market are usually
couched in terms of the theoretical ideal of perfect competition, which is
supposed to lead to an 'optimal' situation where no one person can be made
better off without making somebody else worse off.
Unfortunately, as Smith points out, the real world is rarely if ever
perfectly competitive, and policymakers can make big mistakes by assuming
that it is. Indeed, 'the presence of an obstacle to free competition and
exchange may require the introduction of taxes, regulations and so on
elsewhere, to restore optimality'. Paradoxically, there are times when
markets work better with more state intervention, not less.
By far the more successful essays in this book are the ones that pay more
attention to the real world than to theory. Dharam Ghai's essay on
structural adjustment shows how one of the legacies of the 1980s has been a
worsening of income distribution profiles, both internationally and within
developing countries themselves.
Between 1970 and 1989, the countries with the richest 20 per cent of the
world's population increased their share of the world's income from 74 per
cent to 83 per cent, while the countries with the poorest 20 per cent of the
world's population saw their share of global income dwindle to just under
1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, income inequalities and the level of absolute
poverty have increased throughout most of Latin America and Africa, and Ghai
worries about the effect these developments will have on social cohesion in
developing countries.
A similar picture emerges from Frances Stewart's essay on the effects that
adjustment policies have had on education. Adjustment puts pressure on
public finances, and in most cases leads to falls in real wages. Stewart
argues that this combination has reduced not only the supply of education by
the state, but also the demand for education - poor households with falling
incomes find it more difficult to send their children to school, since they
become more dependent on the wages that children can earn if they work
rather than spend time getting educated.
In turn, this can lead into a vicious circle, as countries lose all the
benefits of having an educated people. These benefits extend well beyond the
obvious one - better labour productivity - since they affect a nation's
overall welfare, too: babies are more likely to die prematurely if they are
born to uneducated mothers, who will overcompensate for their loss by having
even more babies.
Stewart's plea - with which it is difficult not to sympathise - is for
governments to try to combine adjustment with growth, or at least to protect
education from the effects of deflationary adjustment, either by spending a
little less on defence, say, or by concentrating harder on revenue-raising
than on expenditure-cutting.
The book provides some good evidence that we live in a world that cries out
not so much for less government, but for better government. Recently, it
seems, a number of countries are latching on to this. In Mexico, Chile and
Argentina, political debate has become much more focused on the need for
governments to be more effective providers of welfare, particularly to
eliminate poverty. Still, the question remains: could governments in these
countries ever have raised the resources needed to eliminate social
injustice had they not shunned their way through economic reform?

campaigner's past extremism / Strategic planning

The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning
by Henry Mintzberg
Prentice Hall, Pounds 19.95
458 pages
Henry Mintzberg, a management professor at Montreal's McGill University, has
spent the last 20 years campaigning around the world against the
ultra-rational, mechanistic, highly detailed, and mainly top-down sort of
strategic planning popularised in the 1970s by the Boston Consulting Group,
and in the 1980s by Harvard's Prof Michael Porter.
The results of such planning processes are often rendered inadequate or even
dangerous by shifting events. In their place he has championed the
diametrically opposed idea that strategy is only effective if it is created
by a trial-and-error process of 'crafting' - a combination of intuitive
anticipation, and rapid reaction to events. Rather than being planned in
deliberate detail beforehand, on the misguided assumption that companies can
'know' the future, the Mintzberg doctrine is that effective strategies often
'emerge' from outside events, or from the everyday actions of
entrepreneurial managers at all levels.
Since the mid-1980s, his message has penetrated a growing number of
companies. Over the same period, events in the 'real' world - of politics,
economics and industrial competition - have reinforced the realisation that
no amount of detailed planning can help companies such as General Motors,
IBM, Kodak, Philips and Volkswagen react to - let alone anticipate and mould
 -their constantly shifting environment.
One might, therefore, expect a book with this title to be a mere celebration
of the defeat of Mintzberg's bete noir: the left-brain processes (linear,
verbal, analytical and purely rational) which have always dominated the
teaching and practice of corporate strategy.
The book certainly celebrates the sort of right-brain thinking (intuition,
pattern-recognition, and synthesis) which he has always advocated. But it
does much more than that. In a phrase, it represents the mellowing of
Mintzberg.
His documentation of planning's fall from grace is thorough in the extreme.
He explains at length, for instance, why there is such a gulf between
'strategy' and 'planning'. The first may be either an emergent 'pattern', or
what he calls a deliberate 'perspective'. He defines the second as merely 'a
formalised system for codifying, elaborating and operationalising the
strategies which companies already have'.
Most of his criticisms of the old strategic planning school are fair, if
brutal. It suffers from two key fallacies, he says. The first is that
thought should be detached from action, with strategy decided only by top
management and central staff, rather than by practising managers. The second
fallacy is that planning, despite being a purely analytical activity, can
create the sort of synthesis which is required to develop strategy. As he
says: 'Strategy-making is an immensely complex process involving the most
sophisticated, subtle and at times subconscious of human cognitive and
social processes.'
Lesser butts of Mintzberg's criticism include: top management's mistaken
faith in supposedly 'hard' data; the propensity of some managers still to
cling to the discredited world of medium and long-term forecasting; and the
enthusiasm of others for the 'multiple scenario' techniques pioneered by
Shell.
Only on the last of these does Mintzberg misread reality, and mislead the
reader: Shell's approach is not, as he claims, based on the idea that, since
the future is unpredictable, 'then by speculating on a variety of futures,
you might just hit upon the right one'. In reality, the essence of Shell's
admittedly complicated approach is to encourage managers to develop
strategies which are resilient to very different possible futures.
Mintzberg's peccadillo is unfair, but not venal enough to take the edge off
the freshness of the final quarter of the book, where he rehabilitates
planning and planners.
Instead of working in their old top-down way, Mintzberg argues that planners
have critical roles to play in support of line managers. They should
challenge managerial thinking by posing the right questions, not by seeking
the right answers. They should help 'articulate, justify and elaborate'
(fill-out) the strategic vision of leaders at any level.
Mintzberg calls this sort of activity 'strategic programming', but says it
need not always be formal. Instead, he even acknowledges that planners may
need in some cases to act as what he calls 'strategy finders': recognising
and broadening the impact of strategies 'emerging' unnoticed from the
organisation's experimentation and messy learning, or from the actions of
its competitors.
In other words, a degree of rationality and planning matters after all. 'Too
much planning may lead us to chaos, but so would too little, and more
directly,' Mintzberg concludes. That is obvious commonsense, but it is still
quite a volte-face from his past extremism. In many ways, the book's title
should be reversed to 'the fall and rise of planning'.

Business cultures

<TEXT>
The Seven Cultures of Capitalism
by Charles Hampden-Turner and Alfons Trompenaars
Doubleday, New York, Dollars 25
404 pages
This new study offers insight into how different business cultures and value
systems influence behaviour and success in the commercial worlds of seven
countries.
It stems from a questionnaire given to 15,000 managers from the US, UK,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Japan between 1986 and 1993.
The framework used to compare their values and business cultures is a set of
seven 'valuing processes' that come into play when a society chooses how to
create wealth.
The first valuing process is 'making rules and discovering exceptions'. Each
country, and each organisation within it, must set generalised rules,
procedures and routines, while at the same time making special exceptions to
those rules.
The other six cover the extent to which a culture analyses or integrates;
relies on the individual (vs. the community); feels in control of its fate
(vs. control by external forces); does things in sequence (vs. in
synchronisation); expects status to be achieved (vs. ascribed); and desires
equality (vs. hierarchy).
Many of the responses are illuminating. For example: should a
poorly-performing subordinate, who you know has trouble at home, expect your
protection against others in the department? Most American managers (95 per
cent) said the subordinate had no right to protection. Attitudes were
similar in Germany (94 per cent), Sweden (91) and Britain (84). By contrast,
only 56 per cent of Japanese and 43 per cent of French managers agreed with
this view.
The book devotes three chapters each to the US and Japan, and some of the
most interesting material concerns the differences in the way they approach
almost every dimension of business. The analysis explains why the two
countries have found their trade negotiations so difficult.
The authors explain the more subtle reasons why things go wrong. The
American preference for analysis leads them to seek clarification of the
details first. After all, reason Americans, if the numbers don't add up,
there is no point in going to a lot of trouble to develop a relationship.
The Japanese, on the other hand, prefer 'integrating', which makes them
approach a situation cautiously. They need to sense whether a harmonious
working relationship is possible, and whether the potential partners are
trustworthy, before they bother with the numbers. The Japanese manager feels
he can deal with the details further down the road if the relationship has
potential to succeed.
The chapters on Germany, France, Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands each
show a depth of understanding that is rare in the comparative genre. The
authors explain why the US, with its universalist, individualistic,
analytical, egalitarian mindset, has been so successful at producing
products with universal appeal - such as McDonalds, Levis and Coca-Cola.
These values, however, also handicap the US in important ways. They stifle
creativity and discourage managers from relying on mentors or caring for
employees. They encourage high executive turnover, reducing the incentive to
train anyone. They foster hostile takeovers and an over-reliance on
profitability as a yardstick of success.
The chapter on Britain offers a rich and complex explanation of why its
industry is in decline. One of the main culprits, say the authors, is that
Britain has been unable to resolve the seven value dilemmas.
'Wealth-creation is a function of the resolution of dilemmas facing a
national economy.' The problem with Britain is that it has a love affair
with words. It enjoys intelligent discourse, oratory, rhetoric - anything
other than solving the dilemmas.
The authors recite the familiar list of British inventions lost, sold, or
given away (the jet engine, steam turbine, penicillin, the computer, the
hovercraft) due to a lack of interest in the squalid business of exploiting
their commercial value.

Labour Legislation and Public Policy
by Paul Davies and Mark Freedland
Clarendon Press Oxford, Pounds 45.00 (hardback)
Pounds 19.95 (paperback)
692 pages
This massive and comprehensive study of the relationship between labour law
and governments since the second world war deserves to enjoy a readership
beyond that of labour law students.
It is far more than just a legal textbook, and of genuine value to anybody
interested in what remains one of the most important subjects in post-war
British politics.
Not only do the authors provide a full and succinct account of the
development of industrial relations legislation, from the days of full
employment in the late 1940s to today's flexible labour market; they also
relate this to a wider political context.
The book shows how the minimalist system, based on voluntarist principles
(so-called laissez faire collectivism) that believed employers and trade
unions alone should decide the outcomes of collective bargaining, came under
pressure from the demands of an increasingly interventionist state committed
to full employment and economic growth.
From the early 1960s, successive government attempts were made to replace or
modify voluntarism with a more legally regulated system.
The authors themselves would like to see the creation of a 'more stable, yet
juridified system of labour law' in Britain which would combine 'individual
industrial justice with collective representation' in a 'socially balanced
and reasonably humane political economy', as in most of the European Union.

Rights at Work: Employment Relations in the Post-union Era

The New American Workplace: Transforming Work Systems in the
United States
by Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt
Obtainable from ILR Press, Ithaca, New York, Dollars 40.00 hardback,
Dollars 18.25 paperback
278 pages
The American workplace is being transformed at a rapid pace under the impact
of global market pressures. Companies are cutting costs and improving their
competitiveness at a time when collective bargaining and private-sector
trade unionism face the prospect of virtual extinction now that only 12 per
cent of workers are organised.
As a result, an important debate has begun in the US over the future of
employee rights. As Richard Edwards asks: 'How can the employer's need for
flexibility in his operations be reconciled with workers' legitimate
aspirations for basic protections and fair dealing at work?' Present trends
suggest that the US is returning to the adversarial labour-management
relations that characterised much of the pre-New Deal workplace. The demand
for labour flexibility and reinforcement of the employment-at-will doctrine
may be understandable among employers who fear their position is being
undermined by free trade and deregulation on global markets.
But, as Edwards argues in his thoughtful book, autocratic management has
severe limitations when market pressures require companies to create and
retain 'highly motivated, loyal, hardworking employees'.
Is it really credible for companies to try to build up trust and security
with their employees, but also demand an unquestioned power to hire and fire
them?
The author suggests that collective bargaining is no longer a realistic
option in dealing with that conundrum, because 'unions today represent far
too few workers to serve as the centerpiece for workers' rights.' Apparently
'collective bargaining can no longer be regarded as the core institution for
a new regime of workers' rights'.
Nor does Edwards pin much faith in the statutory provision of workplace
rights as an alternative, arguing that there are severe limits on the
state's ability to legislate, and that legal regulation can be 'clumsy,
expensive and highly ineffective'.
Instead, he argues for the legal codification of what he calls 'enterprise
rights', the detailed guides provided by companies for their workers
individually that spell out their terms and conditions of employment.
The author believes employers must find a mutual interest with their workers
to ensure 'an effective, accepted and responsible system of industrial
governance'. Unless they recognise this, he argues, they must expect workers
to press hard for new federal government regulations to extend their
individual workplace rights to protect themselves against arbitrary
management.
By making 'employee handbooks legally enforceable', with access to
independent arbitration, Edwards believes he can create 'a new common
ground' where 'legitimate aspirations' contribute positively to 'employers'
competitive needs'.
But is this realistic? Edwards himself admits: 'Perhaps a majority of
American employers offer virtually no enterprise rights at all.' Such
so-called rights, where they do exist, are unilaterally provided by
companies so they can easily be abrogated when or if necessary.
It is hard to see why companies should agree to have their own employee
guides made legally enforceable, because it would restrain their unilateral
right to manage. Perhaps Edwards should have looked at ways of helping to
renew trade unionism as the answer to the genuine problem of workplace
rights.
Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt suggest in their highly informative
survey that corporate America - contrary to its adversarial image - may be
pragmatic enough to adapt to workplace change through co-operation rather
than conflict.
Certainly they found a surprisingly large number of US companies willing to
experiment with progressive forms of workplace organisation (total quality
management; just-in-time production; joint teamwork and the rest) than might
have been expected.
The authors estimate that a quarter to a third of firms 'have made
significant changes on how workers are managed' with serious quality-at-work
programmes. But their book also pinpoints 'obstacles to change' in the
American system, notably the 'lack of an institutional infrastructure'
ensuring that organisational innovation is 'overly dependent on the
personalities and commitments of key individuals.'
Moreover the 'ideological opposition' to job-security regulation makes it
'difficult for transformed firms, which rely on mutual trust, to honour
commitments they have made to employment security during periods of
recession.'
The authors point to successful employer-union partnerships (at Rank Xerox
with the Clothing and Textile Workers, and the Saturn project between
General Motors and the United Autoworkers for example) to suggest that
organised labour is not as anachronistic as many human-resource pundits
suggest.
Indeed, the implied but unfashionable conclusion from both books is that
collective bargaining and union workplace representation may not be such
obsolete concepts after all.
Perhaps American employers faced with the tidal force of global change
should question their instinctive dislike of trade unions. By sharing
responsibility in achieving growth and profitability with their workers
through collective representation, companies in many sectors may find
themselves better equipped to prosper on world markets than those that do
not.

The Marketing Casebook
by Sally Dibb and Lyndon Simkin
Routledge, Pounds 15.99 (paperback),
Pounds 30 (hardback)
270 pages
The case study has long played a central part in teaching at business
schools - indeed, Harvard does most of its MBA teaching through case
studies, and has invested heavily in recent years to update and
internationalise its material.
Producing topical, detailed and objective studies of organisations for
students to pick apart, discuss and learn from, is labour-intensive and
expensive. Ready-made case material, of the sort contained in The Marketing
Casebook, is likely, therefore, to be particularly welcome and well-used on
MBA and undergraduate marketing courses, as well as by individuals
attempting to get to grips with marketing issues.
The 15 case studies in the book cover a range of European companies,
including Euro Disney, Harris Queensway, Electrolux, Heineken, Kodak Norge,
and JCB. Each case contains a summary of issues for discussion and
cross-references to theory notes.
The notes, plus pointers to further reading, cover the usual marketing
course topics, including market research, segmentation, product management,
pricing, distribution, and international issues. An introduction provides
some guidance for students on how to tackle a case study and present
findings.
The Euro Disney study, for example, deals briefly with the revitalising of
Walt Disney's marketing worldwide since the mid 1980s, the expansion of its
theme parks and the move into Europe - followed by disappointing attendance,
local hostility and staff layoffs. Discussion points for students (and,
since the company's problems continue to unfold, no doubt for Disney
executives, too) include: 'What were Disney's US core marketing assets? How
applicable were they to its French base in Europe? What aspects of the
marketing environment did Disney ignore? How could it have researched
these?'
The Harris Queensway case study traces the success of the group's flagship,
the Queensway furniture retailing chain, during the 1980s and the events
that subsequently pulled the group down - the reduction in consumer
spending, a failure to keep up with retailing trends, and the unsuccessful
refocusing of the Times Furnishings and Queensway chains.
There was no full marketing research into consumer preferences and no
marketing department. When times got really tough, the study details how all
senior management in non-operational areas were immediately sacked,
including all marketing and planning executives. Issues raised for
discussion include: How could Harris have targeted additional market
segments? What were the main influences on consumer behaviour? How could
consumer needs have been researched? How could a new entrant best challenge
the market leader?
It is easier, arguably, to analyse and draw lessons from the experiences of
companies such as these, which are publicly acknowledged to have made
mistakes and misjudgements. More difficult is to present balanced evidence -
without the benefit of hindsight - of a company which currently seems to be
performing strongly. Some of the cases which fit this category are less
successful.
For example, the study of TGI Friday's, the restaurant chain which is owned
in the UK by Whitbread, reads rather more like a glowing testimonial from a
public relations company, than a cool academic appraisal.
Here are a couple of samples of the kind of prose that sits unhappily with
the more objective material in the book: 'Whether it is a simple coffee, an
unpronounceable cocktail, a bowl of chips or a five-course meal, TGI
Friday's will provide every customer or 'guest' with a truly memorable
experience.' 'Regular visitors to the Friday's talk about the Friday's
experience - a mix of buzzing atmosphere, flamboyant decor and friendly
staff, with a real will to please. . . The staff treat guests as if they
were valued visitors to their own homes. They are met at the door with a
warm welcome and accompanied to their table in a true Friday's frenetic,
good-humoured style.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (21): Financial magician's
stockpicking tricks fail to astonish - Jim Slater's latest book is an easy

Investment Made Easy: How to Make More of Your Money
By Jim Slater
Orion, Pounds 24.99
328 pages
Old figures from the 1970s are gradually being rehabilitated. Jimmy Carter
is now perceived as a well-intentioned soul, Abba songs are enjoying a
revival, even Richard Nixon is being granted elder statesmen status.
So perhaps it is unsurprising that Jim Slater is making a comeback. At one
time, his reputation as a financial whizzkid seemed irredeemably tarnished
by the collapse of the Slater Walker conglomerate in the mid-1970s.
Now he has a stock-tipping column in the Independent, and this is his second
investment book in two years. Indeed, Mr Slater, for whom the word chutzpah
might have been invented, has already devoted an entire Independent column
to plugging this book.
The good news is that his latest book is, by the standards of the genre, an
easy read. The bad news is that the information it contains scarcely seems
to justify the cover price. The first half is a trot through the highways
and byways of personal finance. This is fine as far as it goes, but can be
obtained better (and cheaper) elsewhere.
To be fair, what Slater has to say about endowment policies (he doesn't like
them) is very sensible. Perhaps a greater surprise to the newcomer is that
such a renowned stockpicker has so many kind words to say about
index-tracking funds. Nevertheless, one doubts whether many people will want
to pay Pounds 25 to receive his thoughts on such subjects.
I am sure the main appeal of a book from Slater is the belief that he has
the knack of picking wonder stocks. In this sense, his labyrinthine
wheelings and dealings in the 1970s, which prompted so much criticism at the
time, may just add to his appeal as a financial magician.
Such investors will turn to the second half of his book, headed 'More Active
Investment', for the section on shares. What they will find is a boiled down
version of Slater's previous book, the Zulu Principle (to which he makes
repeated references). Those who have read the earlier book - published for a
more modest Pounds 18.99 - will not need to read this again; Slater
enthusiasts are probably better off with the earlier tome.
Of course, one might argue that Pounds 25 is a snip if the reader can
discover the secret of successful stock market investment. But will they?
Slater's main enthusiasm is for growth shares - companies with a long record
of strong earnings growth. He emphasises the PEG, the relationship between a
share's prospective price-earnings ratio and the company's expected earnings
growth rate. The aim is to find companies with PEGs of less than 1 - that
is, where the expected growth rate is higher than the p/e.
Growth stocks can, of course, be highly profitable. The problem is that they
command a high price, and if their earnings disappoint, the fall in share
price can be both sharp and swift. Stock markets can be temporarily dazzled
by such companies, so relying on prospective p/es and forecasts for earnings
growth can be dangerously misleading.
Slater himself refers to the dangers. At one point he writes: 'During 1993,
after some painful investment experiences with shares like Sage and Micro
Focus, I decided to avoid investing in any further computer software
companies.' What he does not mention is that Sage received quite a lengthy
write-up in the Zulu Principle, and that both stocks were tipped in his
Independent column. Bad luck on those who followed his earlier advice.
Other stocks tipped by Slater may have done well. But as a quick test of his
methods, I looked at the performance of the six shares which would have been
picked out of the FT-A 350 Index in May 1993, on the basis of Slater's
criteria: Betterware, Inchcape, Rentokil, Rothmans, Tibbett  Britten and
Wellcome.
While Slater says, 'I want to make it clear that I am not recommending the
purchase of any of these shares', this is largely because circumstances will
have changed between May 1993 and the time the reader buys the book.
Nevertheless, since he spends much space trumpeting the method, it seems
reasonable to ask how well those shares have performed since May. The answer
is, not very well. In the nine months between May 1 and February 1, 1994,
the six shares rose by an average 3.83 per cent (after allowing for some
tricky calculations on Rothmans); over the same period, the All-Share Index
was up by 25.6 per cent.
Of course, someone using Slater's methods today might easily produce a
portfolio of outperforming shares. The point is, not that formulaic
stock-picking methods cannot work, simply that they cannot work all the
time. So do not read Slater's books and columns for the stock tips, but for
the financial analysis they contain. And hope they publish a cheap
paperback.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (20): Just round the S-curve -
The future

   By PETER MARSH

<TEXT>
Predictions
by Theodore Modis
Simon  Schuster, Dollars 21
300 pages
What's the link between Aids deaths, road accidents, fruit-fly breeding and
the development of new computers?
According to Theodore Modis, all these phenomena can be understood better by
searching for patterns from the past. Modis spends much of the book looking
at 'S-curves' - the pattern by which growth in a specific variable starts
slowly, and gradually picks up before reaching a plateau.
He ranges across human and animal activity in picking out events where the
S-curve pattern seems to hold. Modis argues that by studying past patterns
we may be able to shed light on future events. According to this thesis,
Mozart died at a young but entirely appropriate age, at the point where his
creative juices had all but expired as shown by the S-curve of his major
compositions.
The writer attempts, with some success, to fit similar ideas to broader
areas of activity such as oil consumption or the development of rail
networks.
He melds into the S-curve view of life some fairly familiar discussion of
Kondratieff cycles, spiced with the variant that, according to Modis, the
boom/bust period of such cycles often lasts for precisely 56 years. On this
basis, the final 28-year phase of the current cycle is virtually upon us, as
a result of which the period between 1996 and 2024 will be a long economic
upswing.
While stimulating, the book has two main faults. Modis frequently gives the
impression that he is too smart for his own good. He switches a little too
easily between discussion of the growth behaviour of bacteria, building of
12th century cathedrals and the role of information technology.
One revelation, made in best clever-clogs style, but which seems wildly
implausible, is that the 56-year boom/bust cycle is related to the
construction of Stonehenge.
A more serious criticism is that Modis seems unsure who he is writing the
book for. Many economists and business planners may turn to the volume for
guidance as to how to improve their highly unsuccessful forecasting methods.
Although they may enjoy the read, they will get little practical advice.

Bartlett's Book of Business Quotations
Compiled by Barbara Ann Kipfer Little,
Brown, Pounds 9.99
266 pages
I have been poor and I have been rich,' says Sophie Tucker. 'Rich is
better.' Very sharp. Are there any more where that come from? Not many,
alas.
If it is true that 'Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains' (Jane
Ellice Hopkins, 1870), this book is certainly not a work of genius. The
pains taken with Bartlett's Book of Business Quotations were strictly
finite.
It claims to give the date, when possible, of its quotes - but never
provides the year of the Shakespeare plays from which extracts are taken. It
tells us that the New Testament comes from the Bible - a fact with which we
may be familiar; but it does not hazard a guess as to the century when
Lao-tzu lived - even though it insists on passing on his highly dubious
remark that 'People are difficult to govern because they have too much
knowledge.'
'I cried all the way to the bank' is here credited to Liberace's 1973
autobiography, but was current well before that. Goethe may have added to
the quote which begins,'Art is long, life short'; but it was Hippocrates, of
Hippocratic-oath fame, who conceived it two millenia before. Disraeli may
have used 'Something would turn up' a little sooner, but surely it was
Dickens who bestowed it upon his Mr Micawber for all time.
'It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers,'
appears here as an undated 'James Thurber Saying'. Why? In fact, he wrote
that, or something like it, in Fables for our Time. As for the publication
date, Bartlett's editor can look it up for herself. After all, 'Genius is
one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration' (Thomas
Edison, 1932). And when she has finished perspiring over that, she can ask
herself why the two almost identical quotes about genius are dumped in
different sections of the book, the first under 'Entrepreneurship', the
second under 'Motivation'.
One quote, by Freud as it happens, consists only of the words 'To love and
to work'. As my children would ask, what's that got to do with the price of
fish?
We may well ask how the one thousand extracts came to be selected. The
answer seems to be that they were hived off from the 20,000 lying around in
a previous selection, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. But they might as well
have called it 'Bartlett's Religious Quotations' or 'Sporting Quotes', so
irrelevant are they to industry, commerce, finance and, in most cases, to
anything.
Of course, they can be applied to business, but then so can 'Three Blind
Mice' if you push it. But do they pass the supreme literary test? Could a PR
department slip them into a speech written for a company chairman?
A few of the mots are genuinely bon. 'Beware of all enterprises that require
new clothes' (Thoreau) is a delight. So is Woody Allen's advice on getting
ahead: '80 per cent of success is showing up.' Mark Twain ('Cauliflower is
nothing but cabbage with a college education') shines out of a dull page.
Parkinson's Law about work expanding to fill the time available, which oddly
enough is related to business, remains true. There is also a wry truth in
John Ray's thought of 1670 that 'in a calm sea every man is a pilot' (just
wait for it to reappear in 'Bartlett's Book of Sailing') And a big hand to
Everett M. Dirksen for: 'A billion here, and billion there, and pretty soon
you're talking about real money.'
But that's about it. Henry James had some fine passages; the two extracts
here are not among them. As for Aristotle, some of whose unhelpful
pontifications are included, to my mind he passed his sell-by date in about
1494. You can quote me on that.

Scuttle your Ships Before Advancing, and other
lessons from history on leadership and chance
for today's managers
by Richard A Luecke
Oxford University Press, Pounds 14.95
240 pages
The use of great literature to shed light on business problems was exploited
by two American academics in The Classic Touch: Lessons in Leadership from
Homer to Hemingway, published by Dow Jones-Irwin in 1987.
But if art mirrors executive life, so managers who cannot remember the past
must be condemned to repeat it. That, at any rate, is the thesis of Richard
Luecke, a business writer who has entertainingly brought together a handful
of instructive historical episodes for those struggling to cope with late
20th century corporate change.
Hernan Cortes, the Spanish adventurer who penetrated the heart of the
powerful Aztec empire, is presented as the archetypal risk-taking
entrepreneur (he was so confident of success after landing in Mexico that he
scuttled his ships - hence the title of the book).
The Roman Emperor Hadrian and Louis X1 of France - the cunning 'Spider King'
of the late Middle Ages - are both shown to have been early exponents of the
art now known as 'management by wandering around' (MBWA). And the way in
which radical new ideas are only accepted when the time is ripe is explored
through the markedly different stories of the religious reformer Martin
Luther, and that recently deceased American missionary of industrial quality
W Edwards Deming.
At a time when many multinationals are trying to shake off any national
identity, perhaps the likes of ABB's chief executive Percy Barnevik can
learn something from the way the Roman Empire enlisted the allegiance of
different peoples and blended different cultures.
Perhaps the fiasco of the Battle of Midway - the second world war naval
encounter in the Pacific which, against the odds ended in a US victory over
the Japanese fleet - is a salutary tale of the unexpected and of the
limitations of strategic planning. And perhaps the career of Thomas
Hutchinson, of Massachusetts who represented the King's interests in the
colony before the American War of Independence, is a striking example of how
the leadership qualities that serve organisations well in one era are
sometimes inadequate to the challenges of another.
But historians, politicians, strategists and business people should beware
reading too much into the past; and Luecke has not always heeded advice
offered by a New York professor to 'let the history tell its own story' and
to keep the 'B-school' interpretation to a minimum. 'Like a 1970s-style CEO,
Trajan (Hadrian's predecessor) expanded the Roman conglomerate still
further' is the sort of sentence that for some readers will jar.
Luecke admittedly goes out of his way to stress the limitations as well as
the lessons of history. He quotes the ill-fated memorandum which compared
the situations facing the French in 1954 and the Americans in 1965, and
which influenced Lyndon Johnson's decision to send major US ground forces to
Vietnam. And he cites approvingly the historian Carl Gustavson's warning
that 'any statement in which the prefatory 'history teaches us that. . .'
used as a springboard should be very carefully scrutinised'.
History is helpful because it is full of people, experiences and challenges
with which we can identify today. It is surely appropriate, therefore, that
business leaders in this of all eras - faced with an unprecedented degree of
change and the task of guiding anxious and confused workers - should find
time to study the past as a means of understanding the present, and perhaps
as an inspiration for finding solutions for the future.
No society, though, should wish its business people to be too
backward-looking. History is littered with failure and disappointment, and
too close scrutiny of the statistically poor chances of, say, successfully
starting a new company or launching a new product might persuade tomorrow's
risk-takers to pack it in.

Working it out at Work

Sherwood, Pounds 9.95

Marilyn Wheeler had just been promoted. As she parked her car in the
management car park for the first time, she felt on top of the world.
The feeling did not survive her first meeting with the boss, who spoke
disdainfully to her from the other side of his big desk, making her feel she
was bound to fail.
Being a plucky girl, Marilyn did not let it get her down for long. She took
an assertiveness course, and, fresh from its lessons, marched into her
boss's office and told him that his oriental carpet and over-sized desk were
blatant power signals.
This exchange took place some years ago. Now the wicked male executive has
got rid of the offending carpet, and replaced the desk with a round table.
And as for Marilyn, she is living in California making a living writing
books telling people about how they, too, can deal with the problem people
in their lives.
In the old days, if someone was being difficult at work you fired them if
they happened to be your subordinate, and put up with them if they happened
to be your boss. These days you go on courses and read books to equip
yourself with winning strategies. The result is that the 'difficult people'
segment of the management publishing industry is booming.
'You've already taken the first step by buying this book]' says Wheeler in
the first chapter of Problem People at Work.
In the next, she reveals that the trick of dealing with impossible
colleagues is to remain in the 'Freedom State', as opposed to the 'Immature
State' or the 'Controlling State'. This is a fancy way of saying that it is
better to keep calm then to let yourself be crushed or to fly off the handle
 -advice which seems so obvious as to be scarcely worth saying.
The rest of the book takes each different variety of nightmarish behaviour
type by type. It catalogues real-life examples of insulters, time-wasters,
moaners, show-offs, bullies, blamers and so on, and for each supplies the
appropriate response.
Faced with someone who explodes, you should apparently avoid fighting words,
keep eye contact, use a strong voice. If your difficult person whines all
the time, you should ask them what they are going to do about their
problems, make them feel responsible (and therefore less likely to
complain). When dealing with the sort of person who always takes the credit,
you should be assertive, professional, blow your own trumpet, and above all
stay in the freedom state.
After treating you to 100 pages of other people's colleagues from hell,
Wheeler invites you to confront your own worst workmates. 'Take Action]' she
urges. Simply reading her book is not enough, she says: you must complete a
probing questionnaire about your difficult person, and about your responses
to them. She warns that you will never change your colleagues' characters,
but by thinking about the problem carefully, and by planning a strategy, you
will thwart them in their impossible ways.
Wheeler's old boss, with his big desk, has a lot to answer for.
Relationships in the office are just not as simple as she makes out.
Although one can recognise her stereotypes, they are of little practical use
to apply to real people. Coping with people in real offices calls for common
sense, sensitivity, and for a trial-and-error approach. Some of the advice
is reasonably sensible - but amid the exhortations and exclamation-marks
there is no room for subtlety, which is surely the key to getting yourself
out of hot water at work. Those who are inept in their dealings with others
should read this book at their peril. Its simplistic solutions may backfire]
As least Wheeler keeps much of the psycho-babble at bay, which is more than
can be said for Julie Hay. Hay, who was once upon a time an ordinary
employee, a trade unionist and subsequently a manager, has suffered a
wholesale conversion into the serious psychoanalytical world of
Transactional Analysis.
Working it out at Work is riddled with jargon and diagrams. 'The position of
mutual respect is summarised by IOKYOK,' she says at the outset. That is
short for I'm OK, you're OK, and it is TA's way of saying that two people
are getting along. Apparently, if either side is not OK, any number of
conclusions and diagrams can be deduced.
Then there are the different personal styles: we are all either adults,
parents or children - the classification depending not on our age or
offspring, but on our behaviour and emotions. This is only the beginning:
'controlling parent' must be distinguished from 'nurturing parent', and
'internal child' from 'adapted child'.
And will any of this make you better equipped to tell the boss you don't
like the size of his desk? Possibly, but by the time you had worked your way
through Hay's 'dream triangle', and fussed about the 'negative payoffs' and
the 'ulterior transactions', he might, with any luck, have retired.

A Study of the Privatisation of the Electricity Supply
Industry in England  Wales
by Alex Henney
EEE Ltd, 38, Swains Lane, London N6 6QR, Pounds 400
389 pages
Give or take the odd flicker, the lights have stayed on in Laddingford.
In the broad sweep of civilisation, this may seem to be of trifling
consequence. But I have always regarded my domestic supply - based as it is
on electricity dribbling from the end of a rural supply line in Kent - as a
fairly accurate indicator of the health of the electricity supply industry.
When, prior to privatisation, the Central Electricity Generating Board
warned that the security of supply would be seriously impaired if generation
was separated from the national distribution grid, I stocked up with
candles.
And yet this proved to be just one of the many myths and weaknesses exposed
by the privatisation of the industry - one of the most complicated and
ambitious attempted by any Government.
The CEGB, for instance, claimed its system was 'the envy of the world', and
yet, as Alex Henney shows time and time again, the board was inefficient,
complacent and downright misleading when it came to presenting the true cost
of nuclear power.
The industry was producer-dominated, with the area electricity boards having
little influence over (or, one suspects, little understanding of) its
wholesale price, the bulk supply tariff.
Management was patchy and over-influenced by trade unions, while the
Electricity Council, the central co-ordinating body, was largely
ineffectual.
It must be said that there was little malevolence in all of this. The
managers and staff did their best; indeed, their dedication to public
service (demonstrated admirably in the aftermath of the 1987 hurricane) has
often been undervalued.
It was the basic structure of the industry that was wrong. It was also
highly politicised.
For all of its shortcomings, privatisation has produced a considerable
improvement on the original system. The industry is much more commercially
aware; power and influence has been transferred to where it should always
have been - the distributor, or regional electricity companies (RECs).
This commercialism, this desire for a quick return, has inevitably put
strains on other strategically-important energy industries, however. It has
given rise to the dash for gas in generation; it has accelerated the run
down of the coal industry, while opening the import gates to foreign (often
subsidised) coal. It has also put a question mark over the longer-term
future of the currently aided nuclear industry. The lack of an energy policy
is all too evident.
A former chairman of the London Electricity Consultative Council, Alex
Henney has been a long-time critic of the supply industry. In this study he
has provided a comprehensive analysis of the financial and operational
processes of privatisation. Given the complexity of the subject - and it did
take an army of 600 experts to plan the process - he is to be commended for
mastering the detail.
Where this book disappoints is in its lack of personality. Little is
recorded of the tensions and arguments that punctuated, and in part shaped,
the privatisation debate. Why was it, for instance, that Sir Philip Jones,
chairman of the Electricity Council, was sidelined from events, in spite of
his substantial Whitehall experience and propensity for grappling with
complex issues?
What of Lord Marshall, former chairman of the CEGB and the world's most
colourful and controversial exponent of nuclear energy? When, in 1989, the
government decided to exclude all nuclear reactors from privatisation he was
'invited to resign'. That is all we are told.
And then there were the chairmen of the area boards. They were far from
united in the privatisation debate, displaying varying degrees of commercial
acumen, personal ambition, retribution, and plain old-fashioned public
service.
Most of them are still in place, now as leaders of the privatised RECs (and
doing very nicely, thank you). Alex Henney is a consultant, advising - among
others - electricity companies, which might explain why he has steered well
clear of the more colourful personal issues. This is a pity, for it was the
personalities, not statisticians, who shaped the new electricity supply
industry with all its market strengths and imperfections.
Ray Dafter, former resources editor of the Financial Times, was a central
director of the Electricity Council from 1983 to 1988. He is currently
director of corporate affairs at Enterprise Oil.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (15): 'The threat from
advertisers' - Raymond Snoddy discusses an academic's theory that private
entities, rather than governments, are the most consistent and most
pernicious 'censors' of newspaper content / Media

Advertising and a Democratic Press
by C. Edwin Baker
Princeton University Press, Dollars 24.95, Pounds 20
203 pages (incl 50pp of notes)
Critics of advertising usually point to its role in promoting an ultimately
unsustainable consumerist view of the world, or its potentially disruptive
impact in thrusting luxurious lifestyles under the noses of those who cannot
afford them.
Prof Edwin Baker has an even graver charge to level at the industry, at
least in the US: that it has destroyed diversity and competition in the
American press and, at least to a degree, debauched its standards. He
believes advertisers pose an even greater threat than politicians to press
freedom.
'Despite the potential danger and occasional occurrence of government
censorship, private entities in general and advertisers in particular
constitute the most consistent and the most pernicious 'censors' of media
content,' Prof Baker argues.
For the author, the most deadly case of advertiser influence was the mass
media's 'virtual silence' about the dangers of cigarette smoking, long after
these effects were well known to the medical community, to protect media
revenues from cigarette advertising.
The power of advertising can extend throughout the media conglomerates, such
as when a New York Times series on medical malpractice so upset
pharmaceutical companies that they threatened to withdraw 260 pages of
advertising from a medical magazine owned by the paper. Rather than buckle,
the New York Times sold the magazine.
However, the central thesis of the book is that advertisers have played a
fundamental role in destroying competition in the US newspaper industry. By
1989, only 26 US cities still had competing dailies.
This process of consolidation - which has, on the whole, produced a bland,
timid non-partisan press, according to Prof Baker - has largely resulted
from the fact that the largest paper in an area gets a disproportionate
amount of advertising. The increasing subsidisation of the cost of editorial
material leads to increasing dominance and the collapse of rivals. As rival
papers become uneconomic, overall circulations fall, because the survivors
do not acquire all the subscribers of the deceased titles.
Prof Baker believes that a commitment to democracy strongly supports the
treatment of media content as a 'merit good', to which all citizens should
have access, at least to some reasonable extent.
The author has one relatively simple suggestion to make to cure the problem.
To reduce the influence of advertising on newspapers, Prof Baker would place
a 10 per cent sales tax on newspaper advertising and redistribute the money
as a subsidy based on a paper's circulation revenue. This might reduce
advertising revenue by 10 per cent, but could increase revenues from
circulation by 30 per cent, rewarding newspapers that pleased their readers.
A similar process could apply to broadcasting. In 1989, for example, a 6 per
cent tax on television advertising would have provided Dollars 1.78bn to
fund public broadcasting.
Whether such an interventionist approach amounts to practical politics or
not, Advertising and a Democratic Press is an essential book for anyone
interested in the structural impact of advertising on American newspapers in
particular and the American media in general.
It is less clear how relevant such an analysis is for the British press.
Although advertising subsidises newspapers to a significant extent, a
reasonable diversity of views has survived, even though left-of-centre
opinions are considerably under-represented.
The relevance to Europe of Prof Baker's views cannot, however, be dismissed
entirely. He cites the well-known case of the Daily Herald. When it ceased
publication, it was read by 4.7m people, nearly twice as many as the Times,
FT and The Guardian added together. The problem was not a lack of readers,
but that the Herald's readers 'were disproportionately poor working-class,
and consequently did not constitute a valuable advertising market to reach'.
Ironically, a free marketeer like Rupert Murdoch appears to be moving in
Prof Baker's direction by cutting the price of The Times to 30p. By doing
so, he has based his main hope for the paper's future on increased
circulation revenues, by persuading more people to buy the paper, rather
than courting advertisers by offering a narrow elite readership.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (12): Looser rules to encourage
new players - Andrew Adonis weighs the case, now being debated in the US,
for more competition in local telephony and an overhaul of the (woefully
inadequate) regulatory structure / US communications

Toward Competition in Local Telephony
by William J Baumol and J Gregory
Sidak MIT Press, Dollars 27.50
169 pages
William Baumol and Gregory Sidak are in that happy league of advocates of
radical reform: they are on the winning side. At any rate, they are so for
more than half of their reform agenda, which is as much as one can hope for
in this life.
For the non-economist, their book is a tough read in parts, and much of the
regulatory and industry detail is less than vital to non-US readers. But
their essential argument consists of two propositions: that there is room
for more competition in local telephony; and that the current US regulatory
structure is woefully inadequate as a mechanism for promoting efficient
competition.
The first proposition is gaining increasing international acceptance. In the
US, competitive access providers have been growing fast, competing against
the local Bell companies to provide businesses with access to the
long-distance carriers. The regulatory structure looks set to loosen
further, with cable companies allowed to offer telephony services and vice
versa.
The speed of the change is remarkable, given America's history of
legislative sclerosis. Bills currently before Congress, and likely to pass
in some form, would repeal cable-telephone cross-ownership rules, although
they would still prohibit telephone companies from buying cable systems in
their own service areas. A separate bill would permit the local Bell
companies to compete with ATT and the other long-distance carriers.
To an extent, the US is following the UK's lead. Three years ago, the
government decided to break the pre-existing BT/Mercury duopoly and allow
new operators to build local cable telephone and television networks, while
banning BT from offering entertainment services over its own network for a
decade. Cable companies - mostly US-owned - are currently investing nearly
Pounds 5bn in building networks in conurbations which, by the end of the
century, will cover about half the country.
The Baby Bells are keen to take the lessons back home. However, it would be
rash to presume that the US telecoms map is going to be rewritten overnight,
even if the draft legislation is enacted.
The recent decision of Bell Atlantic to call off its Dollars 21.4bn merger
with Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television service company,
citing the 'unsettled regulatory climate', is a sign of the continuing
difficulties.
A particularly thorny issue is that of 'universal access' - or, as Al Gore
puts it, the imperative that there should not be 'information haves and have
nots'. As yet, there is no such concern in Britain, where the cable
companies are regarded as providing an additional, non-essential service to
their customers.
What does universal access mean? Special 'universal access' payments by
competitors offering new broadband services? Vouchers for the poor and/or
rural dwellers? If the latter, paid to whom and by whom? These are key
questions, which will need to be answered if the inter-active super-highways
are intended to provide 'universal service'.
Baumol and Sidak concentrate on a revised regulatory system to promote
competition. Essentially, for the (former) monopoly carriers, they want to
move away from rigid, service-by-service rate-of-return regulation to a
price cap applying to the average price of services in a basket - much as
does Oftel, the UK telecommunications regulator.
For new entrants competing against an existing operator whose network they
have to use to deliver their service, the authors want to see access prices
which include the 'opportunity cost' involved in the existing operator
losing market share to the new entrant.
They call this approach 'efficient component pricing'. It has the advantage,
they argue, of only admitting competition that is truly efficient, providing
real service improvements and/or price benefits to consumers. Furthermore,
they suggest, it reduces concerns about new entrants simply 'cream skimming'
the more lucrative parts of an operator's business.
The question, of course, is how to set the 'efficient component prices'. But
then, setting access charges under current regimes is a tough business -
witness the acrimonious disputes between telecoms competitors currently
taking place across the world. The principle is attractive. It deserves a
serious reception from the regulatory community, which more than anyone will
determine the shape of telecoms markets country by country over the next
decade.

Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh,
the Computer that Changed Everything
by Stephen Levy
Viking, Pounds 15
292 pages
I was counting the other day the number of computers I own. I think it is
about a dozen: at least two in the car, one in the CD player, the video
recorder, the washing machine; even the little portable radio. But only one
looks like a computer, staring back at me as I write: about the size of a
telephone directory, it opens up into the familiar keyboard and a 17cm flat
screen.
All the other computers in the house perform their tasks like a staff of
unobtrusive servants, making sure the water is just hot enough, that an
orchestra will play exactly when I require, and that my carriage will convey
me swift as imagination or . . . well, at 70 miles an hour, anyway. They are
so efficient that we have forgotten that they exist, and we certainly do not
care to have anything to do with them.
By contrast, the superior class of computers that take our letters, check
our spelling, keep our diaries, play games with us and verify our accounts
have become, in the last decade, important parts of our lives, in the
office, and recently at home too.
When personal computers first appeared, they were not much liked. They were
surly and slow; they would communicate only in a stilted and unnatural
language which required one to memorise codes; and if one gave a slightly
wrong instruction they would look completely blank, or answer back with the
insolent word: 'ERROR]'.
But a revolution has taken place; its significance is often not understood,
even by the millions who are discovering that computers have become friendly
(even obsequious), helpful, clever and fun. Screens are covered with little
pictures (Icons, in computerspeak). Mice, pushed around the table, shift a
pointer to the desired picture, and at the press of a button, a little world
of information or computer application, jumps into life in a 'window' on the
screen.
The revolution began in 1984, with the birth of the Apple Macintosh
computer, after a fraught conception and traumatic delivery at the company's
headquarters in Cupertino, California. It was an 'insanely great' idea, said
Steve Jobs, Apple's founder, who inspired and maddened his team of young
engineers. They wore tee-shirts and sneakers and were steeped in the
alternative culture of California of the 1970s. Their mission was no less
than to topple International Business Machines from its dominance of the
personal computer market, by producing a machine, no longer an alien
processor of digits, but an extension of human intellect and creativity.
They failed. The first Apple Mac, introduced to the world with a fanfare of
aspiration, was flawed by inadequate power, some rickety programming and
Jobs's misreading of the market. The team that expected to change the world
collapsed in exhaustion and despair, and then dispersed. Jobs left Apple,
and John Sculley, an apparently more conventional manager whom Jobs had
enticed from Pepsi-Cola, took complete charge.
Slowly, the fortunes of the Mac improved. It found an important niche in the
publishing world, and remains the only significant rival to IBM in personal
computing. But the real revolution is that the Mac personality, based on
menus, mice and icons has been cloned in the IBM world.
Stephen Levy, a computer journalist, tells this story with lively
intelligence, pace and a good dose of personal anecdote. Although a
committed believer in the Macintosh vision, he does not mind exposing its
faults, and gives a lively picture of the mismanagement and extraordinary
pockets of anarchy which flawed Apple for some of this period. He also
offers a well observed portrait of Jobs, who emerges as 'insanely great',
rude, arrogant, self-absorbed and sometimes fatally inattentive to detail or
the work of others.
Yet Jobs was also as a kind of prophet. He absorbed and implemented a vision
of the machine as a true servant of the human intellect, an idea proposed as
far back as 1945 by Vannevar Bush, a former vice-president of the
Massachussetts Institute of Technology.
This historical context enables Levy to project the recent revolution in
personal computing into the future, without degenerating into science
fiction. If we can now point at pictures and trace connections between
millions of words, images and figures stored in a friendly gadget, how long
will it be before we talk to it and accept as perfectly natural that it will
answer back? Will computers really become part of our psyche?
Those who doubt it will find this an interesting story, well written in the
American journalist's style and refreshingly free from jargon.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (11): Does Britain need the
German model? - The financial systems are different, says Geoffrey Owen. But
the link between the difference and industrial performance is less certain /

Keeping Good Company: a study of corporate governance in five countries
by Jonathan Charkham.

Banks, Finance and Investment in Germany
by Jeremy Edwards and Klaus Fischer
Cambridge University Press, Pounds 30.
252 pages
German industrial companies are widely believed to have a competitive
advantage over their British counterparts, because they are less subject to
short-term pressures from the stock market, are less vulnerable to the
threat of takeover and enjoy more constructive, long-term relationships with
their banks and shareholders.
It is partly for these reasons that Jonathan Charkham, in his study of
corporate governance in five countries, concludes not only that Germany is
the best, but that Britain's industrial decline will continue unless it
moves closer to the German model.
That the German financial system is different from the British one is clear.
Much less certain is the link between that difference and the industrial
performance of the two countries.
Too many assertions on this topic are based on misleading or partial
accounts of how the German system works. Thus a useful complement to
Charkham's book is this careful study by Edwards and Fischer, of the role of
German banks in supplying funds to companies and in monitoring their
management.
Germany has fewer publicly quoted companies than Britain, and within this
small group only a minority have widely dispersed shareholdings on the
Anglo-American pattern. Most of them have a dominant shareholder with at
least 25 per cent of the equity; this is usually a non-financial enterprise
rather than a bank.
This structure has several implications.
First, owner-managed firms account for a much larger proportion of German
industrial output than is the case in Britain. The small and medium-sized
unquoted companies which dominate much of German industry have little
relevance to Britain's corporate governance debate, which is mainly
concerned with the gulf between managers and shareholders. Most of these
companies fall below the threshold at which supervisory boards are required.
The idea that bank representation on supervisory boards is important for
German competitiveness must be qualified by the fact that firms with this
structure account for no more than 30 per cent of total turnover in the
German economy.
Second, Edwards and Fischer cast doubt on the view that, in the large quoted
companies, the presence of banks on supervisory boards confers advantages in
the provision of long-term finance and in the early detection of financial
stress or managerial failure.
There is no evidence that banks which are represented on boards of companies
make more long-term loans to those companies. Strong competition within the
banking industry, including the savings banks and the co-operative sector,
limits the scope for exclusive relationships; the 'house bank' in a large
firm is typically no more than first among equals in a group of several
banks.
To the extent that banks become aware of impending financial strains, it is
in their role as lenders, not as board members.
Most banks loans are secured by collateral, which reduces the banks'
incentive to intervene in troubled companies to stave off bankruptcy.
Interviews conducted by the authors suggest that, unlike Japanese banks,
'German banks do not in general get directly involved in the reorganisation
of a firm in financial distress and do not possess any personnel who are
specialists at turning unprofitable firms around.' In the case of large
quoted companies, the authors concede, board membership may have 'some
limited positive effect' in encouraging them to intervene, because their
reputation is at stake.
The third distinctive feature of the German system is more relevant to the
corporate governance issue. Where a shareholder has a stake of 25 per cent
or more in a company, it has a greater incentive to monitor management than
the typical British or American institution, whose shareholdings rarely
exceed 1-2 per cent. In addition, the presence of large, semi-permanent
investors makes hostile takeovers difficult if not impossible.
The holders of these large stakes are often suppliers or customers of the
company concerned. The shareholding is seen as part of a set of 'implicit
contracts' which encourages long-term, high-trust relationships between the
two parties. There is stability and commitment - missing in most British
companies.
Does this network of share stakes work to the benefit of all shareholders
and of the German economy as a whole? Edwards and Fischer point out that
some of the companies (including the three big banks), which hold large
stakes in other companies, do not themselves have a dominant shareholder;
they are among the minority of cases where shareholdings are widely
dispersed. It is not obvious that the managers of these companies, not
subject to monitoring by their own shareholders, have a strong incentive to
monitor their fellow-managers in the companies where they hold shares.
Indeed, there is a risk of managerial collusion, to the detriment of both
sets of shareholders. 'Representation of firms on each other's supervisory
boards, and in particular the extensive networks among firms which are
created by common bank supervisory board representation, may allow cartel
arrangements to be made, so that profitability increases for reasons
unrelated to efficiency improvement.'
That the system limits the scope for hostile takeovers may be an advantage.
But it is arguable that the absence of the take-over threat has allowed some
German companies to pursue expansionist ambitions which have been damaging
to their own shareholders and of questionable benefit to the economy. If
British and American companies are too quick to dispose of temporarily
loss-making businesses, the Germans sometimes hold on to them for too long.
Charkham accepts that the German system has a tendency towards rigidity, but
in his view it has a huge advantage over Britain in providing a stable
framework within which managers can take long-term decisions. On balance, he
thinks, the fear of takeover is 'distracting, destructive and inhibiting.'
The need for hostile takeovers would be reduced if investors were more
committed to companies and more active in overseeing their performance.
The necessary moves in this direction, Charkham argues, will not occur
without government intervention. The first step would be the creation of a
Royal Commission which would, among other things, reconsider 'the role and
effects of hostile takeovers.'
Yet Charkham provides no evidence that Britain's industrial decline, a
central theme in the book, is linked to weaknesses in corporate governance.
He notes, for example, that Britain is not represented 'among the major
players in the electronics and computer industries.' But in these two
sectors the short-termist US, with all its failings in corporate governance,
is far stronger than long-termist Germany. Success in electronics has little
to do with the presence or absence of hostile takeovers.
Charkham is on stronger ground in calling for improvements in the
composition and conduct of boards of directors. The process by which
non-executive directors are appointed, and the functions which they are
expected to fulfil, remains one of the least satisfactory features of the
British system.
The other four systems which Charkham describes - those of Germany, France,
Japan and the US - all have their flaws, but he thinks the British system is
more flawed than most. He comments approvingly that in Japan there is a
consensus that 'the shareholders' interest does not have to be satisfied by
a growing dividend stream . . . shareholders' interests may be pushed to the
back of the queue.' This reflects a Japanese concept of what companies are
for, which is very different from Anglo-American attitudes. But whether the
supposed downgrading of shareholders is a central ingredient in Japanese
economic success is another matter.
None of the five countries has found a perfect solution to the corporate
governance problem. Just as the Japanese and German system of interlocking
share stakes has potential costs as well as benefits, the same is true of
Britain's reliance on takeovers and an active stock market. No doubt there
are many things wrong with the management of British companies, but there is
no compelling evidence that the pressure on them to maximise shareholder
value is a competitive disadvantage.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (10): Out of the spare room - In
profile: two publishers of business books

<BYLINE>
   By GAY FIRTH

<TEXT>
Michael Becket, man-of-all-work at Flame Books, publishes business books on
a scale not so much small as tiny. He likes it that way.
'Mind you, it's jolly hard work doing absolutely everything yourself.
Especially running round the bookshops, selling. If you see a man with a
satchel full of books, complaining about his hernia, he's a small
publisher.'
In real life (which is to say, full-time profession) Mr Becket is the Daily
Telegraph's City news editor. He slots Flame Books into the category of
serious fun.
'I'm hard-nosed: you've got to be. Of the six books I've published, only one
has lost serious money. That was when I fell victim to Publishers' Disease.'
He says it in capital letters. 'Publishers' Disease is the book you think
ought to be published. That's where a small publisher can go badly wrong -
that, and the problem of working capital.'
Mr Becket argues that the time-gap between commissioning a book and actually
getting it into bookshops is the reason why the publishing industry is more
capital-intensive than it needs to be. Into that gap fall authors' advances,
editing and design costs, printers' charges (paper, printing and binding),
warehousing, sales reps, overheads - the bureaucracy of publishing. Nine
months is shorter than full term for the birth of a book. Michael Becket,
running his imprint out of his spare bedroom, laughs scornfully.
'I once got a book into bookshops a fortnight after the Budget, with the
Budget changes already in it. Why not? Flame Books is a microcosm of the
industry as a whole. Anyone can publish a book quickly.'
Most publishers, he says, think they are selling to readers. 'They're not -
they're selling to bookshop book buyers.' He runs through sales patter:
''This is the book you want.' 'You the rep?' 'I'm the chairman. This is the
book you want'.'
His signal success, How the Stock Exchange Works, has sold about 60,000
copies in editions updated every two years or so. Economic Alphabet, a
glossary of financial and business terms, launched on the back of the Daily
Telegraph's Money-Go-Round feature, has sold nearly 30,000.
'One day I was writing about sterling M3 without being quite sure what it
meant. So I phoned the Bank of England and got a definition. Then I wasn't
sure exactly what a discount house was - and when I checked it out with City
folk their answers ranged from 'er' to 'um'. Hence the book.'
The effort is in selling, distribution, and fighting for prime space on
bookshop shelves.
'For Flame Books it's still touch and go.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (9): A niche and 40 titles - In
profile: Two publishers of business books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Brealey knows all about the anguish of starting a small business.
Just a day after his first five titles had been delivered to the warehouse,
the company which printed them went bust.
'I had no credit status at the time and had had to put money up front,' he
recalls with due humility. 'If the receivership had been 48 hours earlier I
would probably have abandoned the whole venture. As it happened, in all the
chaos they forgot to send me the invoice, so what was a potential nightmare
turned into a valuable lesson in cash flow.'
Two years later Nicholas Brealey Publishing has carved out a profitable and
instructive niche in the business book publishing world. The company now has
some 40 or so titles on its list, including Lester Thurow's Head to Head,
Fons Trompenaars' Riding the Waves of Culture, and one of last year's big
international successes Re-engineering the Corporation, by Michael Hammer 
James Champy.
It is about to publish Global Paradox, by John Naisbitt (author of
Megatrends) and Robert Waterman's Frontiers of Excellence. On the back of
tripled turnover in 1993 and optimism about the outlook for the year ahead,
Brealey has just hired two new people and moved to new offices in London's
Bloomsbury Square.
The venture is by no means the only small independent publishing house to
have tasted success recently. But Brealey bridles at the cottage-industry
image of tatty amateur. On the contrary, he believes that in a global world
apparently dominated by the big multinational houses, there is every
opportunity for small, focused operators like himself to reach the
bestseller list.
Partly this is because of what he sees as the 'diseconomies of scale' in
many people based businesses. 'If I was in a multinational I would be in
meetings all day trying to persuade others to publish books rather than just
getting on with the job,' is how he puts it.
There is also the question of whether the much trumpeted international
synergies actually work. The Re-engineering book and Daniel Yergin's Russia
2010 are examples of books published in the US by multinationals  - but by
Brealey rather than their local offshoots in Europe.
'Many consumer publishing companies have massively cut back on their lists
to the extent that they are really only interested in potential top-10
winners,' suggests Brealey, who worked for several big houses himself before
creating NB through a buy-out from the Industrial Society. 'It just happens
that business books in this country are not seen in this category.'
Arguably, the trend towards outsourcing has also helped a new player. All
the 'heavy stuff', such as invoicing, credit management, warehousing and
distribution, is sub-contracted out: 'Almost everything except the editorial
policy and marketing - which is what I think a publisher should be,'
Nicholas Brealey adds.

The Provincial Insurance Company 1903-38: Family, Markets and
Competitive Growth
by Oliver Westall
Manchester University Press, Pounds 40
465 pages
On one level, this book is an intriguing tale of entrepreneurial success,
featuring, among others, John Maynard Keynes and his largely successful
record as a fund manager in the 1920s and 1930s.
On another, it provides evidence to challenge orthodox assumptions about the
'competitiveness' and other perceived strengths of the British insurance
industry.
Westall, a business historian at Lancaster University, was commissioned to
write the early history of the Provincial Insurance Company, a small
family-owned concern which ranks among the UK's top 20 insurance companies.
The company still sticks doggedly to its independence, an attitude which
becomes less surprising when the measure of its early achievements is
understood.
The origins of the Provincial were not auspicious. The company's founder,
James Scott, a Bolton cotton magnate, chose an insurance company in
preference to investing in a local bleach factory.
The decision was motivated, in part at least, because it allowed Scott's two
sons and heirs to live in the Lake District, and was greeted with some
scepticism by the insurance establishment. Moreover, as Westall tellingly
describes, the Provincial emerged in a market dominated by a cartel of
powerful insurance companies.
By the beginning of this century, the biggest companies had built up an
elaborate and effective cartel, based on the tariff - an agreed minimum
price for insurance premiums.
The formation of the fire offices committee in 1868 had allowed systematic
rate regulation in fire insurance to become 'formal and explicit', and over
the next 30 years 'a formidable system of market control was consolidated,'
writes Westall.
'By 1903 an array of committees, served by a professional staff, controlled
73 tariffs covering virtually every class of fire insurance, specifying in
detail the form policies should take and the minimum premium rates to be
charged for every aspect of risk.
'The development was of the greatest importance,' he continues. 'If the fire
offices committee could prevent rate competition, it would remove the most
effective solvent of the bonds of goodwill which protected established
companies from competitors trying to build up new market share.'
The achievement of James Scott and his sons Samuel and Francis was to break
into this market. One important tactic was the ability to set premiums at
rates lower than those demanded by the tariff companies. However, the
success of this tactic seems to have depended on three separate elements.
The Provincial took an innovative approach to distribution, which allowed it
to reduce its expense base; while the tariff companies sold insurance
through an extensive network of agents, serviced by a wide and ultimately
costly network of branch offices, by contrast. Provincial built up its
connections with independent insurance brokers (the forerunners of today's
commercial brokers) - such as the Bains (in Leeds) - who were prepared to
deal with a number of separate companies.
The company was relatively quick to take advantage of opportunities to
launch new products, which emerged with some frequency amid rapid
technological and social change. Initially specialising in fire insurance
for Lancashire mill-owners, Provincial broke into the accident market which
emerged after the introduction of compulsory workers' compensation insurance
in 1906, for example. This was 'a buoyant business, free of traditional
links. This allowed less well-established companies to use rate competition
to grow with the market.'
After the first world war, Provincial focused much of its attention on the
motor insurance market, which was an important new source of income for
other non-tariff insurers such as Eagle Star, Cornhill, General Accident and
Lloyd's of London. Provincial built up its share of the motor market by a
selective underwriting strategy. Its offer of a 'country discount' to
motorists driving bigger cars and living in rural areas was not copied by
more established competitors, allowing the Provincial both to increase its
market share by a rate disproportionate to its size and to make profits.
Finally, Samuel and Francis Scott took an adventurous approach to investment
strategy. One of two insurance companies advised by Keynes, the Provincial
invested more than 30 per cent of its funds in the equity markets at a time
when most of its competitors favoured safer government bonds and loans and
mortgages. As a result, Provincial earned above-average investment income,
and stole a significant march on its competitors, who, on the whole, did not
adopt this approach until the 1950s and 1960s.
'Despite the extraordinary changes in the investment environment during the
inter-war years, most insurance investment continued to reflect late
nineteenth century conventions,' says Westall.
By 1938 the Provincial had become a significant 'competitive element' in the
UK market, and was making significant profits. The family's original
investment of Pounds 75,000 was worth Pounds 2.5m by 1938, an increase in
value of about 20 times in real terms. There the story ends, although a
second volume bringing the history up to date is apparently on the cards.
Meanwhile, Westall's analysis of the industry cartel, its disintegration in
the 1960s and 1970s, tariff system and the inefficiencies it may have
shielded, demands further and wider development. All the more so, bearing in
mind the complex challenges that the industry now faces.

The History of the British Petroleum Company Vol. II,
The Anglo-Iranian Years, 1928-54
by J H Bamburg
Cambridge University Press, Pounds 50
639 pages
The subject matter of this book is one of the most gripping stories in 20th
century British business.
It tells how Anglo-Iranian Petroleum, which had made the first commercial
oil discovery in the Middle East in 1908 and six years later fallen under
majority control of the British government when it ran short of capital,
then became, in the 1930s, a leading member of the international oil
industry, before its dramatic nationalisation by the Iranian government in
1951.
The last page of the book contains a photograph, taken in December 1954,
showing two workmen replacing the Anglo-Iranian plaque outside Britannic
House in Finsbury Square, London, with one reading: 'The British Petroleum
Company Limited.' Truly, the formative period of a great British company had
occurred.
During the years covered by this volume, Anglo-Iranian was Britain's largest
single overseas investment and its fortunes a matter for concern at the
highest level in Washington as well as London. It thus found itself in the
crosswinds of competing geopolitical interests: located alongside Britain's
imperial passage to India, Anglo-Iranian was a crucial supplier of fuel to
the British armed forces in two world wars.
For Washington, the undisputed priority by the early mid-1940s was the
preservation of a friendly regime in a country whose northern borders adjoin
the Soviet Union. From a management point of view, it was an explosive
political blend.
The dominant figure at Anglo-Iranian in the earlier part of this period was
Sir John, later Lord, Cadman, who was chairman from 1927 to 1941. Cadman, a
professor of mining turned Whitehall technology adviser, was
international-minded, gregarious and an easy member of Britain's ruling
class.
His successor, William Fraser, started out in his father's Scottish shale
oil company, organised the transfer of that industry to Anglo and became
Cadman's managing director in 1929 at the age of 35. As chairman from 1941
to 1956, this 'autocratic, abrasive and uncompromising' Scot was regarded by
civil servants as a dangerous liability to their delicate diplomatic efforts
in Teheran and Washington.
Dr Bamburg, who has become BP's in-house historian since the first volume in
this series was published in 1982, grants Fraser a somewhat better press
than in some other accounts - although he agrees that the company 'could ill
afford any shortcomings' in the area of international relations and links
with government in a period of such acute political turbulence. Against this
he suggests that, as Cadman's managing director, Fraser was responsible for
running and developing the business whilst Cadman politicked at full
throttle.
Fraser also shared with Cadman a commitment to technological advance and to
financial caution, the latter of which has not always been a quality typical
of the oil industry, or even of British Petroleum.
Among the managerial lessons of a story told here with abundant detail but
insufficient colour, narrative drive and thematic focus, is that a good
managing director does not necessarily make the right chairman and that a
top executive who attains great heights at an early age needs to be watched,
lest he be content for an undemanding board to grow old with him. There was,
the author notes, 'a creeping movement towards gerontocracy.'
It is also evident that from its earliest days, Anglo-Iranian's top
management failed to delegate clearly to those nominally running its crucial
Persian activities. Perhaps this was a function of the company's excessively
narrow focus on production and refining in Iran. That can only be partly
excused by the political pressure it felt from Teheran to pump up oil
volumes and revenues in a period which, like the present, was characterised
by global over-supply and abortive attempts to erect pricing and marketing
cartels.
This failure in strategic thinking in the pre-war years was thus reinforced
by an unsatisfactory managerial structure and perhaps reflected also in a
lack of invention and drive on the marketing side of BP, where executives
tended to look for the nearest shared distribution deal, rather than
attacking the market with determination and originality.
Meanwhile, BP's handsomely profitable business created few incentives to
attack the bureaucracy which was spreading its tentacles in London. Some
will find the most enjoyable page in this book a memorandum from an external
consultant, on the daily pattern within one 'grossly overstaffed' section of
the company.
At 3.15 pm, this report noted, 'again an air of relaxation became apparent
as tea and cake were expected. After tea there was a general feeling that
the back of the day's work was broken and clerks felt themselves at liberty
to read, crochet, make out menu cards, draw or gossip.' Subsequent reforms,
the author writes, 'had little impact on the overall shape of the managerial
structure.'
The drama of nationalisation, however, like all corporate crises, brought
its benefits. Anglo was forced to look beyond Iran for supplies and to
broaden its planning horizon. By the time the plaque was changed in Finsbury
Circus, British Petroleum was a much-changed company, although its struggle
for regional balance and a more flexible culture has continued to the
present day.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (6): An academic manque - John
Plender discovers how Jack Rose read the property cycle better than most
developers / Autobiography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER

<TEXT>
Square Feet
by Jack Rose
RICS Books, Pounds 9.95
169 pages
Few people are less like the conventional stereotype of the millionaire
property entrepreneur than Jack Rose.
While others of his kind took elocution and dreamed of shooting pheasants on
a country estate, Rose was busy rewriting the property industry's leasehold
valuation tables. When his company, Land Investors, had become one of
Britain's better known quoted property concerns, his idea of a good time was
to go out for an Indian or Chinese meal with his wife.
In an age when the fortunes of property developers have largely been
dictated by the ebb and flow of bank credit, this academic manque, who never
took any professional exams, read the property industry cycle better than
most.
Above all, Jack and his younger brother Philip, who died in 1977, were
famously risk-averse. Having graduated from estate agency into development,
they allowed partners, including such well known property men as Harry
Hyams, Felix Fenston and Stanislas Radziwill, to take all the financial
risk. Jack Rose was the detail man, who brought meticulous professionalism
to the task of acquiring and undertaking developments. Only when he had
established a secure financial base through a host of partnership deals was
he prepared to take on the full risk of development.
The Rose brothers' good fortune was to have gone into property in time to
exploit the opportunities thrown up by post-war reconstruction. In the
period of cheap money in the 1950s and 1960s, it was possible to raise an
office block in the knowledge that the cost of acquisition and construction
could be recouped from a long-term mortgage debenture when the development
was completed and let. The rent on the building would cover the cost of
servicing the debenture from the outset. As long as demand for space
remained strong, and the planners perpetuated the shortage of supply created
by the Luftwaffe, people with drive and market knowledge had a unique
opportunity to become rich.
This did not prevent them from cutting corners, as this autobiography makes
engagingly clear. Rose's first employer built his country house estate
agency business by ruthlessly poaching other firms' clients. When Jack and
Philip Rose set up their own estate agency they were forever putting up 'To
Let' boards outside property without permission from the owner, in the
knowledge that the boards would stand for a potentially lucrative month or
so before being removed.
'At one time,' Rose recalls, 'anyone boarding a number 14 bus at Marble Arch
and sitting on the top deck might well have thought that Jack Rose  Co
owned most of Oxford Street'.
The picture that emerges of the estate agency business is unflattering and
wholly convincing. The tale becomes even more picaresque when the Roses
advance to development. As a landlord, Jack was not past breaking and
entering premises at the weekend where the office tenants had legitimately
refused him entry. A friendly builder would then discreetly carry out
improvements that were needed to make the building saleable to an
institutional investor.
Nor is the book reticent about the racy behaviour of others. Rose was at
school with the late Felix Fenston, a developer who did acquire a country
estate and social graces. Fenston's grander friends might well have been
surprised by Rose's tale of how Fenston cynically defrauded one of their
earliest employers. Had these revelations appeared in a book by an
investigative journalist, they would probably have been noisily serialised
in a Sunday paper and caused a dreadful fracas.
There are not many prominent property people with whom Jack Rose did not
have dealings. Yet it is characteristic of the man that he offers little in
the way of anecdotes about legendary figures like Cotton and Clore, and
prefers instead to tell of Sam Champagne, a multi-millionaire cabbie who
lived alone in a small flat and continued to drive his taxi to the end of
his days, sometimes taking fares from people he took to inspect his
property.
Yet Rose, the philanthropist and boffin-cum-entrepreneur, has his silences
and his quirks. Despite professing a love of painting and the arts, he says
little in this book about the appearance of the buildings that he developed;
the photographs suggest that there was plenty to be reticent about. Though
no respecter of conventional wisdom, he is surprisingly respectful both of
the City and the property establishment, and delights in his recent
membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
More endearing is his pleasure at having fulfilled his academic ambition by
winning a Master of Philosophy's degree from Reading University for a thesis
on property.
Interestingly, he expresses no regret that his company was driven into
receivership within four years of his selling out in 1986 - though he does
mildly regret having sold before the market peak.
Had Jack Rose been born in the Potteries, instead of a pub in London's
Hoxton, it would have been tempting to detect an echo here of Arnold
Bennett's novel The Card. As it is, the book contains plenty of nuggets
about a fascinating, highly individualistic industry, as well as a revealing
picture of the London in which the author spent his childhood. The man
shines through, even - perhaps especially - when the prose betrays the
occasional lack of polish.

Japanese Business Etiquette
by Diana Rowland
Warner Books, Pounds 5.99
354 pages
There is something deeply annoying about books on Japanese business
etiquette.
It is not that they do not deliver important and useful information. Diana
Rowland gives us a great deal, about post office opening times and seating
positions at meetings, etiquette at public baths and how to eat sushi.
Nor is it that many such books do not ring true. Diana Rowland's
descriptions of the acute embarassment which non-Japanese can cause by, for
instance, adopting too direct an approach to an initial meeting with a
company or making a show of paying for a meal, ring true.
No, the annoying thing is that many books obfuscate as they clarify. By
turning Japan into the sort of place where people need special guides and
inside knowledge, they make it seem a lot more intimidating than it really
is.
The truth, as Rowland points out, is that etiquette is a small part of what
brings success. What count are either traditional virtues, which hold good
anywhere; or special qualities, such as being an insider within a web of
Japanese relationships - which is beyond the grasp of most foreigners.
Nevertheless, as these guides go, Diana Rowland's is readable, practical,
useful and accurate.

China: the Next Economic Superpower
by William H Overholt
Weidenfeld  Nicolson Pounds 18.99
293 pages
China is indeed shaping up to be the next economic superpower. Its
remarkable success is easily visible to any visitor. Yet even after 15 years
of open-door policies, the country's inner workings remain so well cloaked
that it is a challenge for anybody seeking to chronicle its progress.
Mr Overholt, then, is a brave man. A senior executive in Hong Kong with
Bankers Trust, the US bank, he has observed Asia's development at close
hand. He is not coy about emphasising, in a five-page author's note, his
qualifications. Apparently he was well in the vanguard in seeing the
beneficial effects of the Asian way of promoting economic growth before
political freedom. He also played a 'central but quiet role' in the 1986
Philippine revolution.
Confreres beside whom he stood quietly at the barricades in Manila might be
surprised to find him arguing that democratically-run third world countries
don't have what it takes to forge economic success. Adopting democracy
before economic reform, he writes, has 'virtually always led to economic
strains so severe as to cause economic collapse, more often than not
followed by a reversion to dictatorship.'
Mr Overholt styles himself as a lone western voice against western demands
for all-out and immediate political change in China. This position draws him
into sweeping generalisations in support of the Chinese or 'Asian' way,
often belied by the evidence which he supplies in more sober moments.
Sketching the compelling story of China's growth, he is alert to the
problems which may undermine success, such as poor infrastructure,
bureaucracy, lack of a legal system, burdensome state industries, fractious
provinces and uncertain future leadership. Chinese officials might admit
that the process has been more experimental than the controlled sequence
suggested by Mr Overholt. Reform has moved ahead since this book was
completed.
The author tends to take Chinese statements too much at face value, and
approaches fervour when his twin enthusiasms for China and stock and bond
markets are combined. But he is also alive to the ironies and contradictions
which follow from the grant of economic freedom to a people still ruled by a
totalitarian propaganda machine: for example, that Communist party
secretaries who used to run companies, now by-passed, often find themselves
ensuring capitalist policies of foreign venture partners are followed by the
workers.
Nor can the central element of his thesis be denied. Clearly, Deng
Xiaoping's policy of opening up the economy before the political system has
proved a great deal more successful than Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika.
Not only are Mr Deng and his party still at the helm, but the whole country
is better off - even if the divide between rich and poor provinces has
widened. Meanwhile, Russia sinks deeper into dissension and economic chaos.
However, to observe that the 'Asian' model - economic freedom now, political
liberalisation later - has been successful in countries such as South Korea,
Taiwan and Singapore is safer than to argue that this is the way in which
countries like China should proceed. Each, after all, starts from a
different set of circumstances.
Asians who have for no reason suffered the tap on the door in the middle of
the night, incarceration, torture or worse might ask why their freedom was
incompatible with their country's economic progress. They probably wanted
prosperity, too. The case that political liberalisation is inappropriate for
third world economic success, and therefore that authoritarian regimes are
appropriate, is hardly self-evident.
Mr Overholt argues that the need to win re-election will always undermine
reform policies which involve economic sacrifice, and that reforms need time
to mature without intervention by 'uneducated' voters. Yet a prime
motivation for Mr Deng's reforms was the Communists' recognition of the need
to win a popular mandate to remain in power by reversing ideological
principles which had led them to perpetrate a series of disasters on their
people.
To observe that economic reform eventually produces political change - so
that's all right then - is to admit that pressures for change have been
resisted all along, and finally cannot be denied by politicians and
bureaucrats who have been determined to hang on to power. It is all very
well to assert that Asian countries are different from western ones and
operate by 'consensus'. Economic reforms do take a long time.
Westminster-style democracy may indeed not be the best option. But in the
end, the degree of consensus which a government has built behind its
policies can only really be tested at the ballot box.
The first priority of such governments certainly should be to get their
economic policies right, and China is making a good stab at it. Mr Overholt,
too, should concentrate on the economics and the finance. The politics are
better left to others. The latter parts of his book sadly lose coherence -
especially when he allows the bees in his bonnet to buzz about Hong Kong -
though he ends with a sound discussion of why it is in America's interest to
deal with China rather than seek to isolate it with economic sanctions over
human rights abuses.
There is a definitive book to be written about China's economic rise,
rapidly moving target though it is. This is a long way from being that book.

Financial reporting in the West Pacific Rim

Accounting and Society
by RW Perks
Chapman  Hall, Pounds 15.99
213 pages
The enormous post-war growth of the economies of the Far East has brought
about corresponding, but little discussed, changes in financial reporting
practices in the region.
It should also have increased the importance of considering the impact of
these practices, which is why Financial Reporting in the West Pacific Rim is
a useful addition to the literature.
We learn that Japan only adopted double-entry bookkeeping in the 1870s; and
that the Philippines still has an underdeveloped stock market, because the
system was introduced by its US colonisers but has not taken off because of
the closely-held nature of companies.
It seems there are as many ways of classifying accounting systems in the
region as there are authors, including one which divides the countries into
'Anglo', 'Commonwealth' and 'Cloud-pine'.
The editors see little evidence of efforts to harmonise standards, and there
is still a wide diversity. They should be congratulated for managing to find
some authors for the book who are from the countries about which they write.
It is a shame they were apparently unable to find a contributor who could
have written for them on Indonesia. More disappointing is that they decided
against sections on the more exotic financial reporting regimes in countries
such as China, Cambodia and Vietnam.
On a different tack, it is welcome to find a book on accounting that takes a
broader view of the sector than purely technical texts.
Accounting and Society, by Bob Perks, a professor at Birkbeck College of the
University of London, makes some controversial points in a skim across the
realms of the sociology of the subject.
He argues that accountants are under commercial pressures, and suggests that
their energies are focused on maintaining the appearance rather than
necessarily the practice of independence. He quotes one writer who remembers
being told by a senior partner at his firm: 'You can do anything with our
clients but don't lose them.'
He says there should be a 'Campaign for Independent Auditors' to counter
this problem, although he fails to analyse why no such initiative has
emerged.
Even more controversially, he suggests auditors can be seen as supporting
'criminal' activities, such as increasing management's income and the value
of their shareholdings at the expense of third parties.
Perks makes a case for greater social reporting, a movement which had its
heyday in the 1970s, and argues that there should be extremely wide access
to corporate information, except for sensitive personal data on individual
employees. He neglects to discuss the issues of commercial confidentiality.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (2): Fearful of protection - Why
Japanese investment motives matter / Aspects of Japan

Does Ownership Matter?
Edited by Mark Mason and Dennis Encarnation
Oxford University Press, Pounds 39.95
459 pages
Although Japanese investment in Europe goes back as far as 1878, when Mitsui
opened its first office in Paris, it is only recently that it has reached
significant proportions.
Early investments, interrupted of course by the second world war, were
mainly concerned with providing services to Japanese companies. Hence
shipping, insurance and finance played a prominent role. The change since
the 1970s is the growth of manufacturing investment, which has been heavily
motivated by fears of trade protection.
This book is an early academic attempt to analyse these more recent flows.
In particular, it seeks to compare the behaviour of Japanese companies in
Europe and in the US, as well as setting Japanese patterns of investment in
Europe against those of the US. Its origin is a conference in 1992, for
which the papers are being published, together with commentaries from
rapporteurs that are either bafflingly censorious or gushing in their
praise.
That format is bound to restrict its readership to academic specialists. As
so often before, the lay reader is struck by the slowness of academic
publishing, the sloppiness of the editing and the poor quality of much of
the writing. Moreover, such a wide-ranging list of contributors is never
going to agree entirely with one another. But the book does assemble some
new sets of data, and it does have a certain message to impart, which is
that ownership does matter.
By establishing wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japanese companies have
not only secured the distribution of their products; they have also
maintained control over the production process. Compared with US owners,
they still import a large number of components - or did so when the research
was carried out.
In that sense, the motivation behind Japanese foreign investment is more to
do with trade supremacy in an environment of increasing physical barriers.
European companies rarely establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in Japan; it
may be that the culture which prevents them from doing so is one which also
wants to ensure Japanese supremacy in its own market.
It follows, the book argues, that European policymakers should be concerned
with investment. The book speaks in quite admiring tones of the way in which
the European side implicitly put pressure on Japanese car manufacturers not
to flood previously restricted markets with output transplanted to European
sites when barriers came down in the single market. It suggests there may be
lessons for US policymakers here, too.
That, however, is dangerous stuff. Ultimately it is in nobody's interest
that governments should discriminate in matters of investment. Competition
is distorted, efficiency gains lost and consumers suffer just as they do
when trade in goods is protected. European companies would benefit more from
an open environment, in which they could forge alliances that allow all to
benefit from what technology has to offer.

the Life and Literature of Lafcadio Hearn
by Paul Murray
Japan Library, Knoll House, 35 The Crescent, Sandgate, Folkestone, Kent.
CT20 3EE, Pounds 19.99
379 pages
One sunny April morning, 104 years ago, the small form of Patrick Lafcadio
Hearn, an obscure provincial journalist, stepped ashore at Japan's Yokohama
dock, after a long sea voyage from Vancouver.
Dazzled by 'the white sunshine of a perfect spring day,' Hearn, aged 39,
felt that he had arrived 'in the land of dreams - surrounded by strange
gods.' He was to spend the 14 remaining years of his life there, 'trying to
see into the heart of this mysterious people,' as he modestly put it.
The experience transformed Hearn from a failed Victorian romantic writer
into one of the greatest interpreters of Japan's high-speed transition in
the late 19th century from a medieval to a modern society.
Hearn fell in love with Japan, which he saw as an orderly refuge from his
own turbulent past, and a means to artistic fulfilment. He married a
Japanese, fell out of love with Japan in his old age, when he came to see
the country as suffocatingly insular, and became the first foreigner to be
buried there with the Buddhist rite.
This biography is not, strictly speaking, a business book. Yet it is an
agreeable way of sharpening one's understanding of what makes this country
tick, at a time when Japan is going through bewilderingly rapid change, just
as it was in Hearn's time.
Half Irish and half Greek, this odd character has over the years become a
mainstream literary figure for many Japanese - so an understanding of Hearn
throws some light on Japan's soul.
Hearn's popularity among Japanese readers is understandable, given his view
of Japan as a mirror to show to the west its own moral inadequacy. The 12
books he wrote there also include a poetic record - in the ghost stories,
for which he is best known in Japan - of an era for which many urban folk
feel increasing nostalgia as Japan becomes more western.
Hearn's ideas, clearly explained in this book, are a useful guide to the
traditions behind modern Japanese behaviour. His admiration for ju-jutsu,
the art of applying an opponent's own strength to defeat him, invites an
obvious moral for anyone negotiating with Japanese business or government.
Some scholars have even claimed that the US would have understood Japan
better before Pearl Harbour if it had paid more attention to Hearn's
analyses of Japan's moral and religious standards.
He was one of the first westerners to recognise the importance of Shinto,
later a staple of Japan's militarism. Hearn likened Shinto to the
ancestor-worship practised by the ancient Greeks, and saw many other
parallels between 19th century Japan and ancient Greek society.
To its credit, Paul Murray's biography does not try to ram home pretentious
modern lessons from Hearn's life. Instead, this is a straightforward account
of Hearn's multi-faceted story, by a biographer whose career as an Irish
diplomat in New York and Tokyo parallels some of Hearn's own travels.
It is hard to pick up a biography that shows as much respect for its
subject's character as this one does, because Hearn was an unattractive,
prickly, man. 'Always ill-dressed, unkempt, slovenly; with the face of a
weasel and the manners of an oaf, he was nevertheless one of the most
brilliant and picturesque writers of his day,' in the words of one newspaper
obituary.
One of Mr Murray's important themes is that Hearn's strange life helped make
him free from prejudice in explaining Japan, by comparison with the zealous
Christian missionaries and European-minded professors writing about the
country at the time - and many commmentators since.
Hearn's personal fantastic journey began on the Greek island of Lefkas, from
which he got his middle name, in 1850, when he was born to an Irish surgeon
in the British army and a beautiful but illiterate local woman.
His parents soon split up, leaving Hearn to be brought up by an aunt in
Dublin, in an environment of cultured leisure, only to be packed off in his
late teens to what appears to have been a brutal life in an English boarding
school. Hearn left school at the age of 19, minus one eye - lost during a
game, and a source of lasting psychological awkwardness - to try his luck as
a journalist in the American provincial city of Cincinnati.
There, he specialised in writing about 'the rotten underbelly of society',
including murders, executions, slaughterhouses and city corruption. This
taste for the grotesque later manifested itself in his prolific output of
popular fiction - Hearn is an exponent of the Victorian horror genre,
alongside Bram Stoker and Edgar Allan Poe.
A short-lived illegal marriage with the daughter of a negro slave in
Cincinnati precipitated a scandal. Hearn escaped to New Orleans, where he
became the small-town star of the local newspaper and started to publish his
first works of popular fiction. New Orleans treated him well, but the
ever-restless Hearn wanted a taste adventure.
Armed with a publishers' commission, he set off for the West Indies, for
what turned out to be a disappointing two-year stay in search of inspiration
for more popular fiction.
Hearn romantically claims that his decision to try Japan for his next
adventure began with the 'pleasure bordering on pain' derived from looking
at a paper fan with a simple bamboo design.
As Mr Murray explains, the decision to emigrate to Japan was more
complicated. Chance played a part in keeping him there for the rest of his
days, ending in the arms of his Japanese family in Tokyo. His life was,
appropriately for a journalist, a great story. Moreover, it is a story that
contains a few pertinent messages for anybody trying to understand modern
Japan.

FT  15 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dilution fears hit Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A roller coaster ride in Euro Disney ended with shares in the theme park
operator under severe pressure as analysts and investors took fright at the
group's restructuring plan.
The day had started well for the loss-making French group as the refinancing
scheme hammered out with its bankers sent the shares sharply higher in
London and Paris.
Underpinning the rise was the belief that a FFr6bn rights issue would be
issued at slightly below the current share price of around FFr25. However,
at a subsequent meeting with the company the picture changed dramatically.
Shareholders learned that the rights issue - which will more than quadruple
the number of shares to 770m - was to be made at just FFr10.
Euro Disney fell sharply on news of the potential dilution, closing a net 28
off at 390p with turnover approaching 500,000 shares, 10 times its normal
London level. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram at Morgan Stanley said: 'The
dilution is enormous. We continue to believe that the shares are
fundamentally overvalued at current levels.'
A report that the industry-wide hit over the mis-selling of pensions would
be only Pounds 100m, compared with a previous estimate of Pounds 1bn, gave a
lift to life insurers, with Legal  General leading the way. LG, further
squeezed by a shortage of stock in the market and patchy buying ahead of
figures on Thursday, rose 16 to 483p.
The report, cited in a Sunday newspaper, apparently suggested that only one
person in every 10 who transferred from occupational pensions to personal
plans was expected to claim. The news helped sentiment, although one analyst
pointed out that Refuge, a small life insurer, had made Pounds 11.6m of
provisions for pensions and that figure would probably translate to Pounds
1bn across the board. Refuge closed at 341p ex-dividend.
Oil major British Petroleum moved ahead 8 to 359p as consideration of the
full report and accounts released on Saturday confirmed previous optimism
over cost-cutting and the reserve replacement figures. Hoare Govett pointed
out that although the annual report showed costs were flat in sterling
terms, they were down Pounds 1bn in dollar terms, the currency BP deals in
principally.
Shell Transport was held back by a large line of stock washing around the
market. The shares, which went ex a 15p dividend yesterday, closed unchanged
at 677p after a line of 2m shares was placed in the market at 677p.
Rumours resurfaced that French oil group Elf Aquitaine was poised to sell
its near 10 per cent stake in Enterprise, the oil exploration and production
company. Analysts said the disposal made good sense and would possibly
happen one day, but both companies had denied the speculation, which had
been sparked by a Sunday newspaper report. Enterprise ended 3 up at 414p.
Oversold composite insurers, with big holdings in leading financial markets,
bounced in response to rises on Wall Street, for the Footsie and in US
bonds.
Royal Insurance, regarded as the cheap buy in the sector after
underperforming the All-Share index by 17 per cent over the past three
months, improved 13 to 279p. Commercial Union firmed 5 to 583p and Sun
Alliance appreciated 6 1/2 to 327p.
Insurance broker JIB jumped 19 to 199p after announcing top of the range
profits of Pounds 21.8m and an upbeat statement.
The busy building and construction sectors saw a demerger, several results
and interest rate cut hopes inspire a raft of sharp moves forward.
Figures from English China Clays came in ahead of market forecasts and were
joined by details of the group's plans to spin-off CAMAS, its construction
materials division. The demerger will be by way of a one-for-one share issue
effective on June 1. ECC shares added 13 at 524p. UBS reiterated its buy
stance.
There were results also from Rugby Group, which again came in ahead of
market expectations. They closed 4 up at 328p, additionally helped by the
proposed one-for-one scrip issue. Spring Ram results were in line with
forecasts and this relieved some buyers following the group's recent
chequered history. The shares gained 4 at 67p. Costain put on 2 1/4 at 35
1/2 p following a return to profitability. German interest rate cut hopes
helped Redland rise 12 to 562p.
Restructuring plans at Simon Engineering, including a Pounds 50m rights
issue, were well received and the shares advanced 11 to 117p.
Expectations that the government will soon announce the lifting of the limit
on overseas ownership in Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace boosted both
stocks yesterday. The former moved up 5 to 184p and the latter 8 to 519p.
Analysts expect the government to lift the limit from the prevailing 29.5
per cent to 49.5 per cent.
Nervousness about figures later this month saw Lucas Industries surrender 3
to 212p. TI Group, which disappointed the market last week with the
presentation of its figures, remained in the doldrums. The shares closed at
391p xd.
The market appreciated Cookson Group's Pounds 71.9m disposal of its
engineering businesses to Calder Group. Shares in the industrial materials
group climbed 9 to 285p.
International conglomerate Lonrho gained 5 at 163p on reports that Ashanti
Goldfield, set to be floated this year, will be valued at around Pounds
1.5bn, against earlier predictions of around Pounds 1bn. Lonrho has a 25 per
cent stake in Ashanti. Williams Holdings put on 8 at 403p ahead of today's
results.
Media investment group MAI rose 18 1/2 to 299p after sharply improved
interim profits.
Mirror Group Newspapers added 5 at 190p in anticipation of good figures
today. Saatchi  Saatchi, which is also reporting today, slipped 5 to 142p,
although the stock suffered from receding speculation of a US bidder.
Big turnover in Hillsdown Holdings was thought to have been inspired by a
positive note from James Capel, a delayed reaction to last week's results
and report of directors' share buying. The stock moved forward 4 to 165p,
with turnover touching 10m.
Food retailers were buoyed by weekend press reports of tough talking from
Asda to its suppliers on price and selected brokers continuing to peddle a
positive outlook story. Asda shares edged 1 1/2 ahead to 59 1/2 p. J.
Sainsbury rose 15 1/2 to 376p and Tesco 2 1/2 to 224p.
Renewed doubts over the opening date of the Channel tunnel hit Eurotunnel,
the tunnel's operator. The shares fell 21 to 540p.
A threat of legal action saw Mersey Docks  Harbour dip 14 to 495p.
Encouraging figures from Scotia Holdings, the research-based pharmaceutical
company floated in October, saw the shares advance 10 to 255p.
Coats Viyella improved 11 to 277p ahead of figures scheduled for tomorrow.

<TEXT>
The recovery in both US and European bonds, together with renewed hopes of a
reduction in interest rates, helped the derivatives sector to a steadier
performance, writes Joel Kibazo.
In its last full week of trading ahead of Friday's expiry, the Liffe March
contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,203, in line with the opening on the
underlying cash market. Buyers encouraged by the recovery in US bonds at the
end of last week helped the contract advance in early trading.
The release of encouraging February producer price data, once again led to
hopes of a reduction in interest rates, encouraging increased buying of
March as it climbed to its peak of 3,238 in the afternoon.
Following a bout of profit-taking March finished at 3,233, up 62 on its

FT  15 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 recaptures 3,200 after
bonds recover - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market regained all and more of the ground lost last Friday
as dealers warmed to further encouraging news on inflation and responded to
yet more hints of European interest rate cuts.
There was further comfort for London in the performance of US markets, where
the long bond attracted little pressure in either direction and where the
Dow Jones Industrial Average opened marginally firmer before slipping into
negative territory after London closed.
Mr Ian Harnett at broker Strauss Turnbull described the London market's
showing as 'a tremendous performance', adding that he saw scope 'for more
interest rate cuts'.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended a relatively subdued trading session a net 41.5
ahead at 3,233.4, just short of the day's high and easily outpacing the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index of second line stocks, which rose 28.3 to 3,885.7.
London's excellent performance was part of a Europe-wide advance by bond and
equity markets as some of the impetus of the recent Whitewater story in the
US was lost over the weekend.
UK share prices began the new two-week trading account in good form, with
dealers marking prices higher in response to Wall Street's good showing and
the widespread strong gains in gilts and bonds.
The FT-SE 100 was up 11 points at the opening, a creditable performance
given that no less than 15 constituents were quoted ex-dividend, equal to 12
index points.
Sentiment was given a substantial boost shortly after the opening from news
of much better than expected producer price numbers for February, indicating
that inflationary pressures remain under control and leading to increased
speculation of a further reduction in UK interest rates.
Dealers responded to the good producer price numbers by marking share prices
sharply higher, attempting to head off any sizeable buying, and the FT-SE
100 responded by touching the day's best level, 3,236.1, up 44.2, shortly
before the Wall Street opening.
The latter's reluctance to make further headway and its gradual decline as
European markets closed for the day triggered small bouts of profit-taking
in London, with the FT-SE 100 eventually settling for a 1.3 per cent gain on
the day.
One of the more disappointing features of the trading session, dealers said,
was the low level of business. Turnover was never more than modest all day
and eventually reached 555.2m shares, one of the lowest daily totals this
year. Non-Footsie stocks accounted for 58 per cent of the total.
Marketmakers warned that the low level of activity yesterday would drag the
value of customer business transacted towards the Pounds 1bn. Last week saw
a pick-up in customer activity, which topped Pounds 2bn on Thursday.
The value of customer trade on Friday was Pounds 1.8bn. They also said that
many of the big trading firms had been badly bruised during the erratic
trading in bonds and equities in recent weeks.
Although encouraged by the market's resilience after the recent slide,
senior dealers cautioned that the rest of the week sees a raft of important
economic data from the UK and the US.
From the latter, today's producer price numbers and tomorrow's consumer
price figures are seen as crucial indicators. Tomorrow also brings important
data on UK retail sales and unemployment trends for February.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US investors await week's
economic data
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices showed little change yesterday as investors cautiously
awaited a batch of economic news due out later in the week, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a slight 0.28 higher at 3,862.98
and the Standard  Poor's 500 edged up 0.95 to 467.39. Secondary markets
fared a little better, the American SE composite adding 2.08 at 468.06 and
the Nasdaq composite 3.60 at 792.80. New York SE volume amounted to 260.2m
shares and rising issues led declines by 1,149 to 943.
After Friday's heady 32-point Dow advance, a sober mood returned to Wall
Street. Investors were facing a series of economic reports over the course
of the week, and the anticipation reinforced a general sense of uncertainty
which has dominated the market since the beginning of February.
February producer price data, due today, and last month's consumer price
index, to be released the following day, were commanding the most attention.
With bond traders expecting the reports to supply further evidence of
accelerating inflation, US Treasury prices weakened and the yield on the
benchmark 30-year issue again crept within strik-ing distance of 7.0 per
cent, a symbolic point of support.
During yesterday's session, the pessimistic scenario on inflation was
reinforced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Its February survey of
regional economic conditions showed an unsettling increase in prices paid by
manufacturers in the south-east, a possible harbinger of a broader trend.
The report also indicated strong economic conditions in the region, but on
balance, the likelihood of continued weakness in bonds left equity investors
in a timid mood.
The negative sentiment was most evident in the blue chips, which meandered
within a narrow range of their opening levels during the morning.
Smaller-capitalised issues managed to post modest gains.
The Dow was held back by Walt Disney, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 45 7/8
on heavy volume. The stock fell on news of a restructuring plan for its Euro
Disney theme park.
Technology stocks were well represented in the NYSE's most active list.
Digital Equipment advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 after announcing
plans to issue 20m depositary shares priced at Dollars 25 each.
International Business Machines gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 ,
while Unisys added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 16 1/4 on volume of 4.3m shares.
Elsewhere, Federal Express climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 70 5/8 on news of a
14 per cent rise in delivery volume last month.
Among banking issues, Chemical moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/4
after Mr Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, raised
his rating on the stock to 'buy'. Bankers Trust New York put on Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 75 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft was marked up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 83 7/8 after
the company unveiled new applications software for Apple's Macintosh
computers. Apple was Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 38 1/8 .
Canada
Toronto posted a solid gain in fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 composite
index ended 23.5 stronger at 4,470.4.
Advances outscored declines by 466 to 311. Volume of 75.7m shares was well
below Friday's 95m, while trading value was CDollars 681.7m. Most sectors
were firmer but golds eased.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy and Germany forge ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A wide range of performances characterised the world's equity markets last
week.
Among the European components of the FT-Actuaries World Index, strong rises
by both Italy and Germany, up 2.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively in
local currency terms, were countered by a 2.5 per cent decline in the UK,
one of 1.9 per cent in Norway and of 1 per cent in Switzerland.
Norwegian equities turned negative late in the week after Norsk Hydro, the
energy and fertilisers group, unexpectedly announced that it was to raise
some NKr5bn through an international rights issue.
However, the market stabilised yesterday, in line with a general feeling
among European analysts that the Bundesbank would make a further cut in
interest rates at its council meeting in two days' time, its last before a
four week break over Easter.
Mr Brian Mullaney of Morgan Stanley's global economics group comments that
resolution of the IG Metall dispute represents 'a giant first step in
Germany's struggle to improve competitiveness. Given the moderation in
domestic cost pressures, we would expect the Buba to revert back to a more
consistent pattern of easing and begin to downplay the potential
inflationary risks associated with a somewhat weaker Deutschemark'.
The situation among Asia's markets remained nervous, with Malaysia and
Singapore continuing to add to the falls of the previous week, partly over
worries that US interest rates might be on the rise.
In spite of Japan's slight fall last week, contributing to a 0.1 per cent
decline in the FT-Actuaries World Index, sentiment there remained good.
UBS Global Research, for example, forecasts that the Nikkei average will
finish the financial year-end at around the 20,000 level, an estimate
supported by yesterday's 2 per cent gain.
'While investors were largely chasing an illusion of economic recovery in
1993, they should be able to buy into the reality in 1994,' UBS writes. 'The
problem in this scenario is the extent to which the exporting sectors, which
are supposed to drive the recovery, have already outpaced the market. In the
electrical machinery sector, p/e ratios of a number of issues are already at
levels which are difficult to justify, even on the basis of past peak
profits.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hard sell for a new
British cheese - Churnton's confident launch into the mass market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can almost hear the hoots of derision from across the Channel at the
news that 'an exciting new British cheese' was launched this week. Yet,
after the much-publicised demise of Lymeswold, the imitation blue Brie, the
marketing experts are convinced they have got it right this time.
The Cheese Company, formerly Express Foods and Britain's biggest independent
cheese manufacturer, is oozing confidence. It has spent about Pounds 500,000
developing Churnton - whose name is supposed to conjure up homely images of
traditional cheese-making - and is splashing out Pounds 2.5m on a saturation
campaign of television and magazine advertising, mail shots and in-store
tastings.
Churnton is a hard cheese, made to a secret recipe in the company's creamery
in Malpas, Cheshire. It looks like a cheddar but with an open texture, and
has a fairly strong flavour. Unlike new, specialist farmhouse cheeses,
Churnton is aimed unashamedly at the mass of consumers who buy mild or
medium cheddar for everyday use.
The cheese is being launched first in north-west England, where 18 per cent
of households are 'heavy users' of hard cheeses, and will go national early
next year.
The initial six-week TV campaign began last night with a 30-second
advertisement in the middle of Coronation Street, featuring Victoria Studd,
the popular television presenter, pronouncing: 'After one taste, you'll turn
to Churnton.'
The sales line sprang from the success of trial tastings in Safeway stores
across the country, in which eight out of 10 people said they would buy
Churnton again. It is deliberately packaged to look like an ordinary
cheddar, so 'the trick is getting people to taste it in the first place',
says Maria Dooley, marketing manager.
Price will be important at this end of the market. Churnton will sell at a
slight premium to mild or medium cheddar, but the company has opted for
fixed weight packs starting at 99p for 200g. 'When buying variable weight
packs of cheese, people fish around for the ones that are below Pounds 1,'
says Dooley.
It might seem a gamble to target a new brand at a market which is 85 per
cent dominated by supermarket own-label cheeses, roughly the reverse of
France, where branded regional cheeses abound and the retailing sector is
more fragmented.
Roger Davenport, managing director, explains that 'the relative lack of
branding in the UK is a result of the great success of major supermarket
chains and their drive towards own label'.
But any desire the supermarkets may have for innovation is stymied by
conservative British tastes. Despite the range of hand-made and imported
cheeses on offer, cheddar and other hard cheeses account for more than 75
per cent of sales. That is why Churnton is designed to be familiar, 'while
offering advantages in taste and texture,' he says.
The Cheese Company, which was bought out by its management from Grand
Metropolitan for Pounds 96m only 16 months ago, believes there is room for
growth in the Pounds 1.1bn UK market, of which it expects Churnton to
capture about 2 per cent. British cheese consumption is rising by 1-2 per
cent a year but is still only half that of continental Europe, and a third
of France.
Churnton, according to the launch publicity, is the first British cheese to
be developed for the regular, weekly shopper in more than 50 years.
With weary determination, Davenport fields comparisons with Lymeswold, which
was withdrawn in 1992 a decade after a triumphal start. He says Lymeswold
raised such expectations that the manufacturer, Dairy Crest, could not meet
them and began delivering a product that was not up to initial standards.
'Unlike Churnton, they didn't get much repeat purchasing,' he says. 'Whereas
ours is very much mainstream, Lymeswold was always, however successful,
going to be a niche product.'
Davenport is adamant that the cheese will not be found bland by its target
consumers. There is at least one auspicious sign. When Lymeswold was
launched, Peter Walker, then agriculture minister, was seen on television
feeding chunks of it to his dog Bomba. Gillian Shephard, the present
incumbent, does not have a dog.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sex, sense and
sensibilities - A look at the changes in social attitudes behind a rise in
complaints about sexism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slapped wrists for UK advertisers accompanied the revelation this week that
concern about sexist advertisements appears to be rising. According to the
Advertising Standards Authority's annual report, complaints from the public
about the portrayal of women climbed from 180 in 1992 to 536 last year,
while the number of complaints that were upheld more than doubled from 52 to
111. There is a 'need for greater sensitivity over the use of sex and women
in advertisements', the ASA warned.
But are advertisers really getting worse in their treatment of sex and
women? The indiscriminate use of semi-clad women draped across car bonnets,
or pouting from double-glazing advertisements, for example, seems to be less
common than it once was.
An alternative explanation for the increase in complaints could be the
sharpening of public sensibilities on such issues. According to Caroline
Crawford, ASA head of media relations, a 1980 survey conducted by the
authority showed that women were far more offended by the advertising of
sanitary products than by the sexist advertising that was around at the
time.
A decade later, about one in three women 'felt a degree of animosity about
the demeaning portrayal of women,' says Crawford. The figure for men (who by
this date had also been included in the survey) was about one in five.
'Still the majority weren't that bothered, but those who were bothered were
very bothered. It was an increasingly vocal group,' she says.
The increased use of nudity in recent years may also be a factor. While not
necessarily tasteless, sexist, or irrelevant to the product, it is still
likely to offend a few people.
The current Wonderbra poster campaign is hard to miss and has drawn about 30
complaints to the ASA so far. However, there are no plans to investigate,
says Crawford. The posters are of 'a confident woman of the 1990s who is
very aware of her sexuality and is certainly not a victim,' she says.
Likewise, the recent Haagen-Dazs ads, which showed a couple in various
states of undress enjoying ice cream, was considered by the ASA to be
tastefully photographed and sensitively handled. Even, says Crawford, 'if it
couldn't be said to be completely relevant' to the product, the treatment
probably would not offend the majority of people.
Rita Clifton, director of strategic planning at advertising agency Saatchi 
Saatchi, agrees that nudity in advertising has increased: 'We're not as
uptight about showing naked bodies - they are now an acceptable public
currency for many. What is not acceptable any more - if indeed it ever was -
is portraying a woman as a victim, a stupid partner or somehow not in
control of her own destiny.'
On the whole the ad industry has to toe the line. There are no inflexible
rules - either for printed advertisements, governed by the ASA, or
television commercials, supervised by the Independent Television Commission
 -about which bits of the human body may or may not be shown. Instead,
advertisers have a general duty not to cause offence; how that is
interpreted in each case depends on the context, treatment and innuendo.
For example, a lingerie advertisement from Scandinavian retailer Hennes,
which showed no more cleavage than the Wonderbra advertisement, did fall
foul of the ASA. The strapline on the poster read: 'What the au pair will be
wearing this winter.' Says Crawford: 'Men wrote in and said 'I employ an au
pair and I object to the implication that all an au pair is good for is to
act as a man's plaything'.' What the public does object to, she adds, is
'inept and sexist innuendo' rather than sex itself.
Humour may be the salvation of an advertisement, even if the context for
nudity is questionable. The ITC let a Danepak bacon ad off the hook, in
spite of complaints, because it was judged 'comic rather than voyeuristic'.
The advertisement showed a family of nudists cooking bacon and giving thanks
that the low-fat product was less likely to spit in the pan than other
bacons.
The trade press continues to present problems for the ASA, particularly
those journals with a predominantly male readership. According to Crawford,
there are still ads around with line drawings of buxom women and strap-lines
which say, for example, 'Free sex' and then go on to say 'Now we've got your
attention lads, come and buy our motorbikes.'
The authority got into a scrap last year with a farming publication over an
ad for paper sacks. A 'page three girl', says Crawford, was used,
irrelevantly, to advertise the sacks. Two complaints, one from a man and one
from a woman, were upheld. The publication and the company then started
lobbying farmers and the ASA was accused of being a kill-joy and guilty of
political correctness. 'You try explaining to a farmer the concept of
sexism,' comments Crawford, who has some experience as a member of a farming
family herself.
Rita Clifton at Saatchi questions whether this kind of advertising actually
works - whether it is aimed at men or women. 'Clearly, advertising needs to
grab people's attention. The problem is that if you show a lithe 18-year-old
in a jock strap, quite often that will be the only thing that's recalled by
women,' she says. Unless the product and the figure are properly integrated,
the product may go unnoticed.
The mention of jock straps raises the question of whether men are these days
as likely as women to be victims of sexist advertising. At the very least
they may be the victims of stereotyping, as an article in the current issue
of She magazine points out. Entitled 'Why the man-bashing has to stop', it
lists the current advertising campaigns which portray men as 'ranging from
dim and uncouth, to pushy and insensitive,' and argues that the campaigns
have little appeal to women because 'women do not want to see old sexist
values simply reversed'.
There have been complaints about men and sex in ads - the ASA annual report,
for example, details the case of the recent Britvic orange juice
advertisement showing a man with wings holding a magic wand and wearing a
posing pouch. The strapline read 'Somehow we manage to cram in 12 oranges'.
There were 35 complaints that the ad was offensive but the ASA ruled that
'most readers would appreciate the humour of the image'.
To date, however, Crawford cannot recall a complaint about men in ads having
been upheld - perhaps that awaits yet another shift in public sensitivities.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Dorrell to aid investment flow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday raised
the prospect of alterations to the tax structure to improve the flow of
funds from savings to investment.
Speaking at a Confederation of British Industry seminar, Mr Dorrell set out
the objectives of his review of savings and the movement of funds through
the economy, announced by the chancellor last summer.
The purpose of the review is to examine the relationship between savings and
investment and to ask how best to allocate capital efficiently within the
economy.
'We need to consider the extent to which we are prepared to use the tax
system to encourage a wider menu of options for financing business,' said Mr
Dorrell.
In his speech to CBI members he highlighted a number of areas of weakness in
the economy. These included:
Manufacturing accounts for a relatively small share of economic activity.
The medium-size business sector is relatively undeveloped, particularly
compared with Germany.
There is evidence that it is difficult to raise significant amounts of
capital for high-tech start-ups in Britain.
Dividend payout ratios appear to be relatively high in the UK,
The financial secretary said the review needed to ask how well institutional
shareholders - which play a crucial role in capital markets - functioned.
Investors in the venture capital trusts, announced in the November Budget,
will be allowed tax relief on up to Pounds 100,000 a year, under proposals
in a government consultative document.
Published yesterday, the document suggests the trusts should be taxed and
structured in a broadly similar way to investment trusts.

The High Court will decide tomorrow on applications by three local

A government decision on the area has already been delayed. The commission
said it had failed to consider about 500 letters from local interests that

unprecedented supplementary report on the area will be published.
It seems unlikely, however, that the supplementary report will make

Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils, and Ryedale, a district in
North Yorkshire, are all dissatisfied with recommendations which would see
the creation of five all-purpose unitary councils north of the Humber in
place of the current two-tier system.
They say the commission failed to consider properly the possibility of
maintaining the two-tier status quo, and to carry out proper consultations.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Beef ban threat hits meat trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German threats to impose a ban on British beef imports because of fears over
'mad cow' disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) had already had
'disastrous' effects on the meat trade for at least one company, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday.
She is preparing a dossier for her German counterparts on the effect of
renewed publicity over BSE on meat exports.
Germany has called for a special session of EU health ministers to discuss a
ban on British beef imports. Mrs Shephard said she hoped the Germans would
withdraw their request because it was not supported by any other EU country.
The German health ministry said yesterday it would take no unilateral action
to ban British beef if the meeting could prove that no risks were involved
in importing meat which may be contaminated with BSE.

FT  10 MAR 94 / NUM in ballot on new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Union of Mineworkers yesterday started balloting its Yorkshire
members over merger plans which, if defeated, would spell the end for the
union's structure, Richard Donkin writes.
A close vote could bring into question Mr Arthur Scargill's presidency,
although those campaigning against the executive admitted yesterday that
such an outcome was unlikely.
The merger vote has been brought to a head because the NUM, which had
245,000 members in 1982, has about 8,000 members, nearly 6,000 of whom work
in the Yorkshire area.
This has led to rationalisation plans including the takeover of the
Yorkshire area's Pounds 5.8m assets to help ease the union's financial
crisis.
A ballot is necessary to achieve the merger because of the NUM's federal
structure.

Mr Brynn Davies, who for 16 years was chairman of Mid Glamorgan Health
Authority, the biggest in Wales, will not have his contract renewed when it

Mr Davies has appeared before a Commons committee twice in three years - the
last time six weeks ago when MPs discussed a report on the way the authority
handled complaints about the death of a 62-year-old man.
The authority has previously caused controversy by failing to tell patients
that a doctor died of Aids until five months after his death, and
allegations that consultants at Merthyr had charged patients for using NHS
facilities.
In January Mr Davies apologised to the committee for the treatment of
relatives of patients who had tried in vain to see a consultant for 18

FT  10 MAR 94 / Tories on attack over local tax: Curry's claim to undercut
Labour council charges by average Pounds 129 disputed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party yesterday signalled that it will place what it claims
are the high levels of council tax levied by Labour-controlled authorities
at the forefront of its campaign for May's local council elections.
At the party's first campaign news conference for the elections, Mr David
Curry, local government minister, unveiled figures suggesting that nine of
the 10 highest council taxes levied in the next financial year would be in
Labour councils.
He also said that, of the 10 lowest taxes, five would be levied by
Conservative controlled councils, including Westminster, Wandsworth and
Ealing.
But Labour said he had chosen an invalid base of comparison, by assessing
every council on the tax charged to households in band C - which applies to
properties valued between Pounds 52,000 and Pounds 68,000.
Figures from the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities
showed that 82 per cent of households in Liverpool, which has the most
expensive band C tax, lived in properties below the band C threshold, and
would therefore pay less than the amount quoted by Mr Curry.
In Westminster, with the lowest band C tax, 84 per cent of households are in
properties valued above Pounds 68,000, and would therefore pay more.
Mr Curry said that the government had been officially notified of the
precise levels of council tax to be levied by about 300 of the 419 local
authorities in England and Wales. He said that the figures showed that on
average councils were levying tax increases of 2.7 per cent in the band C
range.
Although the survey is not complete, this is nearly 4 percentage points
below the amount that the government predicted last autumn, when announcing
its grant settlement for 1994-95, and may reflect the determination of
councils to contain taxes in an election year.
Mr Curry said that on the information the government had received Labour
councils would charge Pounds 129 more on average in council tax next year
than Conservative councils. He said that larger council tax bills were often
levied by councils - such as Lambeth, Tower Hamlets and Islington - which
already receive above average grants from central government.
Mr Curry said: 'What we can demonstrate is that we can provide better value
for money and provide better services.'
Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, said that Mr Curry's
figures were 'unconvincing'.
He said: 'You can't trust the Tories to tell the truth on tax, whether it's
on VAT, personal allowances or council tax. They cannot resist twisting the
truth.'

Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering yesterday won the Pounds 60m main contract

The Pounds 300m joint project by BAA, the privatised airports group, and
British Rail is to construct an express rail link between Heathrow and the
centre of London.
The service, scheduled to start operating in December 1997, will mean that
the world's busiest international airport can be reached from Paddington
Station in 16 minutes. BAA said trains would run every 15 minutes.
The project would create 1,800 jobs during construction and a further 200
during operation, said Mr Rod Hoare, Heathrow Express managing director.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Building societies aim to shake off shackles: A look at the
controversy over the limits to their activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the largest building societies believe they should get a little extra
help from the government to compete effectively in the mortgage and savings
markets.
At its meeting today the Building Societies Association council will discuss
a paper on the current review of the 1986 legislation on building societies.
Announcing the review in January, Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury economic
secretary, highlighted for discussion areas such as the limit of 40 per cent
of funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets; merger and
takeover procedures; and the process for societies to change their status.
The BSA, to which the Treasury has sub-contracted much of the consultation
process, believes the chance of a full review - with the ending of
legislative constraints on societies - should not be missed.
Mr Adrian Coles, association director-general, says some detailed changes it
would like could be done reasonably quickly as part of the de-regulation
initiative.
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich building society, the UK's
third largest, says: 'In fundamental terms, the only thing really pressing
down on building societies is the wholesale funding limit.'
Societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is cheaper
at present, so they can offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers.
For much of last year they lost market share to the banks.
But for the medium term, the association would still like an end to
legislative limits on the powers of societies, except those needed to define
their mutual status.
One suggestion for defining mutuality, set out in an association paper about
18 months ago, is that a society should raise a set proportion of its funds
from its members and have a set proportion of its commercial assets as loans
to members.
Removing the existing constraints on what societies can do would inevitably
mean changes to the way they are regulated.
The paper was tactful enough to say it would prefer the Building Societies
Commission to remain the regulator, but acknowledged the argument for moving
supervision to the Bank of England as differences between banks and
societies diminish.
That prospect was raised by the Bank itself when Mr Brian Quinn, an
executive director, gave evidence to the influential Commons Treasury
committee of MPs last November.
Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the committee, says it will pursue this
issue when it takes evidence from the commission and the association during
its current inquiry into financial regulation.
There are also broader concerns at Westminster. Mr Alistair Darling,
Labour's City spokesman, says: 'The legislation should allow societies to
expand their activities.
'But I would be very reluctant to give them carte blanche to do whatever
they like.'
As Mr Coles puts it, the issue is one of efficiency: no matter how amenable
the Building Societies Commission has been, the need for changes in
societies' powers to be considered by parliament inevitably means delay.
He says: 'Building societies don't want the ability to lend in Bosnia and
Brazil.
'The change would allow us to do things in the markets where we operate in
the most efficient way possible.'
But others question whether societies are trying to seize an unfair
advantage, given the protected environment in which they exist and the lack
of shareholders to hold boards accountable.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, the former society which
converted to plc status in 1989, dismisses the argument that societies are
fully accountable to their members.
He says that most savers and borrowers do not see themselves as having a
controlling role in the society.
'When people go into a building society, they do so because the goods are
attractive, rather than to become members,' he says.
His comments seem borne out by members' involvement.
For example, at Halifax building society, the UK's largest, only about 10
per cent of its 5.5m voting members took part in decisions at last year's
annual general meeting.
Even at Nationwide, the second largest, where the running of the society
became such an issue that members insisted on a couple of their own
candidates becoming directors, only about 103,000 of the 3.5m voting members
were involved in voting for the board at last year's AGM.
Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax corporate development manager, describes the
society as 'happy to look at ways of improving accountability'.
But far from enhancing accountability, the most likely immediate changes
from the de-regulation initiative may reduce the prospects for internal
democracy, since they are directed at streamlining the occasions and ways
for societies to consult and notify their millions of members.
Society chief executives are reluctant to concede the point publicly, but
some privately admit that greater freedoms should be accompanied by more
accountability.

would see the creation of five all-purpose unitary councils north of the
Humber in place of the current two-tier system.
They say the commission failed to consider properly the possibility of
maintaining the two-tier status quo, and to carry out proper consultations.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said it was 'concerned'
by the commission's 'worrying' mistake. It will instruct its members in
areas not yet reviewed to check that all submissions have been considered by
the commission.
The cross-party Association of District Councils, whose members include
Ryedale, discourages districts from resorting to judicial review, as the
process is costly and delays re-organisation.
Five counties - Avon, Cleveland, Derbyshire, Lancashire and Somerset - have
already been allowed to challenge commission decisions in the High Court.
The judicial reviews for Avon, Somerset and Cleveland will take place on May
23.
In the following two weeks the commission, which is working to a timetable
shortened by the government last September, must announce proposals for
re-organising Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire,
Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Hampshire and
Devon.
Proposals for Kent and Devon may also be announced at the same time, if
severe local disagreements in both areas can be overcome.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Stress on jobless takes heavy toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployed people are 75 per cent more likely to experience a marriage
break-up than those in work, says the most comprehensive survey of
employment and joblessness in Britain.
The four-year study, based on 6,000 individuals in six towns, found that in
spite of experiencing multiple deprivations the unemployed are not becoming
a culturally distinct 'underclass'.
It also found that they are flexible in the work they are prepared to
undertake and have only modest pay expectations.
Almost all unemployed individuals are considerably worse off on benefits
than in work - but married women are more likely to give up work when
husbands become unemployed because of benefits rules.
The survey covered Aberdeen, Coventry, Kirkcaldy, Northampton, Rochdale and
Swindon. It is part of the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative funded
by the Economic and Social Research Council. It is published today in the
book Social Change and the Experience of Unemployment (Oxford University
Press). Average labour costs in manufacturing are lower in the UK than
southern Italy, one of the poorest regions of the European Union, says a
report published by the Low Pay Unit yesterday.
But the research group says the UK's success in creating jobs has been much
less than in countries with higher levels of employment and social
protection.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Mercury to spend Pounds 200m on network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the main rival to British Telecommunications in the UK, will today
announce a Pounds 200m upgrading programme aimed at increasing its capacity
to compete in the provision of advanced telecoms services.
The investment in 'intelligent networks' technology will give Mercury one of
the most advanced networks in Europe, able to offer new features such as
corporate phone 'meetings'.
The main contractor is DSC, a fast-growing US supplier specialising in
intelligent networks technology, which is installing similar systems for
several US regional Bell companies. Other contractors include Northern
Telecom, the Canadian supplier, and GPT, the UK-based joint venture between
General Electric Company and Siemens, the German group.
Investment for the first year is expected to approach Pounds 20m, with new
services coming on stream as early as next year.
Cable  Wireless, Mercury's parent company, intends to spread the technology
to other operators under its control, including Hong Kong Telecom. DSC
already has a contract with Optus, the main rival to the former state
monopoly in Australia, which is part-owned by CW.
'Intelligent networks' are sophisticated signalling and computer systems
giving operators the power to route calls and programme local exchanges
without having to install software and hardware at each exchange. They also
offer operators large efficiency and reliability gains.
The investment underlines CW's long-term commitment to Mercury, despite its
avowed intention to concentrate future investment in the Asia-Pacific
region.
It also points the way to future competition between operators not just on
price, as now, but also on the range of sophistication of services, as in
the US.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Labour attacks Major over inflation 'rift'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday seized on remarks about inflation by the prime minister and
the deputy governor of the Bank of England to claim that the two were
'completely at odds'.
Mr John Major said yesterday that inflation was 'under lock and key'. Mr
Rupert Pennant-Rea said it was 'a delusion' to think that Britain had
defeated inflation.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'The prime minister should
clarify his precise inflation target and whether he intends to meet it.'
Mr Pennant-Rea told the Institute of Credit Management national conference:
'It is tempting to feel that Britain has won the war against inflation, so
we can now afford to relax. That is a delusion, and a dangerous one too.'
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage payments, was 2.8 per cent in
January, still in the top half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent
target range. The Bank said in its inflation report, published in February,
that the underlying rate would remain in the top half of the range
throughout 1995, and there was an 'asymmetric risk' it would move higher.
Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'We have to keep inflation down in order to sustain
growth. Monetary restraint is not a hair-shirt but it has to be a habit.
After all the unforced errors of the past it will take many years to prove
we have acquired it.'
Mr Major, speaking to businessmen in Portsmouth, was rather more upbeat
about inflation than Mr Pennant-Rea, but his comments about the UK's
economic prospects were in tune with those of the deputy governor.
The prime minister said: 'What I believe we are beginning to get is a
satisfactory platform for sustained recovery with low inflation.'
Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'The economy will soon enter its third year of
recovery, and the pace of that recovery is enough to have started reducing
unemployment. Meanwhile, inflation is low and the government's target is for
it to go lower still.'
Mr Pennant-Rea's speech marked a departure in tone from the customary solemn
phraseology of top Bank officials. In a candid passage about past mistakes
in monetary policy, he said: 'At the Bank of England we are merely part of
the supply lines. As such, we have the ability to mess things up - and our
record shows we have often used it.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Open minister suffers brush with the truth: A look at the
aftermath of a verbal slip-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Mr William Waldegrave's judgment the turning point came early yesterday
morning. Emerging, still blinking with sleep, from the front door of his
London home he was met by a barrage of questions from waiting journalists.
'Are you going to resign, Mr Waldegrave?' shouted one. 'Why?' responded the
minister for public services and science. 'For telling the truth,' the
journalist yelled back.
Mr Waldegrave decided he could relax. The row about his public comments on
when governments might or might not consciously mislead parliament was
revealing itself as a media storm in a Westminster teacup.
Speaking a few hours later to the Social Market Foundation Mr Waldegrave was
careful not to blame the media. Instead he quoted Enoch Powell's dictum that
a politician who complains about the media is like a sailor who complains
about the sea: 'We amateur sailors often complain about the sea, but it does
us little good.'
An honest politician in a government which has not won many prizes for
giving straight answers, Mr Waldegrave spent the rest of the day in
television and radio studios explaining what he had originally said to a
Commons committee.
No, he had not suggested that it was proper for ministers to mislead
parliament. Instead, he had pointed to two occasions in the distant past on
which ministers had been economical with the truth about impending
devaluations of the pound.
The row rumbled on. Lord Callaghan protested that he had evaded
parliamentary questions but had never told a lie. Opposition politicians saw
another opportunity to pin the 'sleaze' label on an ever-embattled
government. Mr Waldegrave's enemies on the right wing of the Tory party saw
another opportunity to cast him as an inevitable victim of the next cabinet
reshuffle.
After all, he might well face considerable criticism in the report of the
Scott inquiry into arms-related exports to Iraq. Mr Major could offer him as
a convenient scapegoat.
But thoughtful colleagues believe sacking Mr Waldegrave in the summer would
be a mistake. He may not be the most guileful of politicians but he is an
intelligent one.
His donnish approach to politics is in refreshing contrast to the
instinctively combative approaches of Mr Michael Howard or Mr Kenneth
Clarke. And if he has never courted a constituency among backbench Tory MPs,
he does have the powerful support of Mr Douglas Hurd.
During regular appearances before select committees he conducts a genuine
dialogue with backbenchers, acknowledging the force of criticisms and
enjoying reasoned argument with those of contrary views. His handling of the
government's science policy has won him plaudits. His oversight of the
Citizen's Charter has made the best of a bad job.
This week he made a mistake. His desire to answer MPs' questions led him to
acknowledge a practice that every politician knows to be true but which few
ever admit. In more tranquil times no one would have noticed. But the media
pounces now on every slip - even, it seems, when the minister responsible
for open government tells the truth.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Waldegrave says he will not resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave yesterday said he had no intention of resigning as the
minister for public services and science over his comments that ministers
had to lie in exceptional circumstances.
But as the prime minister gave his public backing to his cabinet colleague,
Downing Street was forced on to the defensive by a request from Lord
Callaghan for Mr Waldegrave to 'clear my name'.
This was after Mr Waldegrave said the former Labour prime minister had told
untruths during the devaluation crisis of 1967.
Clearly angered by Mr Waldegrave's comments, Lord Callaghan emphasised that
he had chosen his words very carefully, but that he had never lied to the
Commons.
Comments later released on behalf of Mr Waldegrave sought to make it clear
that the minister had not criticised Lord Callaghan's actions.
The comments stressed that the former prime minister was working 'in
extremely difficult circumstances'. Mr Waldegrave 'specifically recognised
Mr Callaghan's difficulties and believed he behaved with propriety. If Lord
Callaghan now feels that Mr Waldegrave has impugned his integrity it is very
clear that is not the case.'
Downing Street described the devaluations under Labour governments in 1949
and 1967 as 'exceptional circumstances in unusual times'.
It was clear, however, that Mr John Major continued to believe ministers
'must be truthful and not mislead the Commons'.
Mr Waldegrave had pointed to two Labour chancellors, Lord Callaghan and Sir
Stafford Cripps, who had been forced to mislead the Commons in order to try
to prevent the devaluation of the pound.
Mr Major said: 'Mr Waldegrave answered an intelligent question frankly about
what had happened under another government a quarter of a century ago.' The
prime minister was asked on the BBC whether lying could be justified in
parliament. He replied: 'Nobody can and nobody does.'
Mr Waldegrave, asked by Jimmy Young on BBC Radio 2 whether he thought he was
going to keep his job, replied: 'That is entirely up to the prime minister.
If ministers are going to be fired for telling the truth, we are going to
get into a very difficult pickle.'
Mr Waldegrave later told his colleagues that he had no intention of
resigning.
Asked earlier if he had blundered by being too honest, he said: 'If the new
line of attack is to say we really don't want ministers to tell the truth on
these matters, we want ministers who give weasel words, I suppose I plead
guilty.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Pay group raps failure to create jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average labour costs in manufacturing are lower in the UK than southern
Italy, one of the poorest regions of the European Union, a report published
by the Low Pay Unit yesterday shows.
But it says the UK's success in creating jobs has been much less than
countries with a higher level of employment and social protection.
The research group said: 'Italy created proportionately six times as many
jobs as the UK between 1970 and 1992. Germany created almost four times as
many jobs and France created twice as many.'
De-regulation, it said, had not allowed the UK to create employment and it
had not delivered prosperity. 'It has helped to create a situation in which
40 per cent or more of the UK workforce are employed on a part-time,
temporary or casual basis, or are classed as freelance or self-employed.'
The unit said the UK was uncompetitive because productivity was low, pushing
unit labour costs to a level very much higher than the EU average. In part
the UK's low productivity was a result of long working hours and poor
conditions of employment.
Staff turnover and absenteeism were high by European standards and training
was poor. 'These factors were directly related to the low wages themselves,'
it said.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Auditors split on cap to liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medium-size accountancy firms yesterday started to fight back against the
campaign by their larger competitors to limit the exposure of auditors to
big litigation claims.
Mr Peter Douglas, national managing partner of Kidsons Impey, the UK's
12th-largest firm, said he was considering organising a group of mid-size
firms to object to proposals which would allow auditors to cap their
liability at a multiple of audit fees.
'I just find it difficult that auditors should be given some protection
against being negligent,' he said.
His comments follow the decision by the ruling council of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week to support a paper in
favour of reform to be sent to the Department of Trade and Industry.
The institute is echoing a campaign being run by the UK's largest eight
accounting firms calling for removal of section 310 of the 1985 Companies
Act, which forbids auditors to negotiate any limit on their liability.
A number of partners from smaller firms have objected to the campaign as
being self-interested and serving the interests of the larger firms.
Mr Douglas, who joins the institute's council in June, said he had arranged
a meeting on the subject with Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate
affairs at the DTI.
'The larger firms are not in the same market as the rest of us, and that is
because they have tried very hard to ensure we are not,' he said.
Mr Graham Ward, a partner with Price Waterhouse, has argued that part of the
case for reform is that executors of wills of deceased accountancy firm
partners were restricting payments to their widows and children because they
could not quantify the risk of future liabilities the estates might incur as
a result of litigation settlements.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Political Notebook: Inelegant and inevitable U-turn made on
Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks ago the message was crystal clear. Britain had provided more than
its fair share of ground troops for Bosnia. If the United Nations needed
additional forces then it would fall to others - most notably the US - to do
their bit.
Just seven days ago the consensus within the cabinet remained opposed to
reinforcing the 2,000-strong British contingent in the former Yugoslav
province. Mr Douglas Hurd said so in untypically blunt terms in a newspaper
article. Now the government has reversed itself. It has decided it must lead
the international effort to give General Sir Michael Rose the additional
10,500 soldiers he wants to police the growing number of ceasefires in
Bosnia.
The cabinet is expected to approve later today the despatch of another 1,000
or so British soldiers. A few other countries will commit extra troops. But
by its own yardstick the British government will be doing a great deal more
than its fair share.
It has been an inelegant U-turn. It is fraught with political risks. If
there is anything approaching a consensus on the Tory backbenches it is
driven by the instinct that Britain should avoid deeper military
entanglement. Nor has the shift been without critics in the senior ranks of
the government.
No one in the cabinet - from the prime minister downwards - has been an
enthusiast for an enhanced military role. But over recent weeks four
distinct camps have emerged.
One, led by the prime minister, has been convinced by the case for more
muscular action on the ground to accompany the latest drive for a political
settlement. A second, including Mr Hurd, has gradually aligned itself with
that view.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind has headed a third group of more cautious ministers
arguing against extra troops until a broad political deal has been struck.
Finally, Mr Kenneth Clarke and, to a lesser extent, Mr Michael Heseltine
have put the case against further military involvement in almost any
circumstances.
The balance of power has been shifting constantly. But since Friday - when
Mr Major took a decision in principle to commit extra troops - the
initiative has passed decisively to the interventionist camp. The most
important element in the change of heart was the pledge offered to Mr Major
by President Bill Clinton to maintain US pressure on the Bosnian Moslems to
reach a political settlement. With the Russians applying similar pressure on
the Serbs and the Germans on the Croats, that held out a reasonable prospect
of an eventual end to the civil war.
It offered also a not-to-be-missed opportunity to draw a line under the
acrimonious disputes with Washington that have poisoned British-American
relations for more than a year. The change in the international environment
coincided with the success of General Rose in gradually extending the
ceasefire in Sarajevo to other areas.
That in turn opened up the possibility of a 'bottom-up' peace process - with
a series of regional truces providing additional momentum towards an overall
settlement.
Britain could hardly jeopardise the process for the sake of a few hundred
troops.
But the clinching factor in the new equation was the demand by General Rose
for additional British troops. Though he couched his public demands in terms
of the UN, he left no doubt that his first priority was for additional
experienced British soldiers.
Ministers, who had consistently stated that the government's military
strategy would be guided by the commanders, could hardly ignore warnings
that British forces were being 'stretched to breaking point'.
For most in the cabinet - with the exception of Mr Clarke - the case for
reinforcement has become irresistible. Mr Major will claim that Britain is
taking an important lead. But it was the force of circumstance which made
this latest U-turn as inevitable as it was inelegant.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Company-car drivers confess to sins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company-car drivers are nearly twice as likely to break motorway speed
limits than private motorists. They also break speed limits on other main
roads more readily and admit to parking illegally more often.
This unflattering portrait of company-car drivers is set out in the latest
annual survey of the business-car community by polling organisation MORI and
Pragma Consulting. The survey was commissioned by Lex Vehicle Leasing, owned
by Lex Service and finance house Lombard North Central.
MORI's soundings among fleet managers about the differences between men and
women found that 'in general women are thought (by fleet managers) to be
better and safer drivers and that they look after their vehicles better'.
Younger fleet managers were more likely to feel that women made better
drivers.
More pertinent in terms of the costs incurred by companies on repairs and
insurance premiums, when asked 'Who in your organisation has most
accidents?', 43 per cent of the managers said men and 54 per cent saw little
difference. Only 4 per cent said women.
The survey concludes that the percentage of company cars, at 11.3 per cent
of the total, is higher than for several years and that the population has
increased by 50,000 in the past 12 months.
The average age of the cars has fallen from 2.8 years to 2.5 years in the
past 12 months, indicating that companies are increasing the replacement
rate. Mr John Walden, Lex Vehicle Leasing's managing director, sees this as
a sign that business confidence is improving.
He said: 'Companies make investment decisions, like replacing company
vehicles, when they are confident that the business climate is improving.
The survey results . . . clearly indicate a turnaround in business outlook'.
Only 1 per cent of company-car drivers surveyed said their companies were
phasing out company cars.
More than 4,000 stolen cars were offered for sale to dealers in the last
quarter of last year, reflecting a continuing surge in car-related crime and
fraud, according to HPI, the vehicle information tracking agency.
HPI also found last-quarter increases in vehicles written off by insurance
companies being repaired and re-offered for sale, and more cars being
offered for sale while still subject to hire-purchase agreements.
The agency makes about 3.5m vehicle-background checks a year for auction
houses and the motor trade.
Mr Brian Bailey, HPI's chairman, said part of the rise was likely to be
seasonal and related to financial pressures in the approach to Christmas.
But there was also a 'worrying underlying trend' driving the statistics
upwards.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Treasury stalls Tube gates deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground is attempting to win Treasury approval for a Pounds 4m
deal to lease automatic access gates for 12 of its busiest stations but has
yet to reach an agreement on the financing terms.
This is the second time within a month that a London Underground proposal to
bring in private finance to pay for investments has met Treasury objections.
A Pounds 500m deal to lease 100 trains for the Northern Line from ABB
Transportation has also run into difficulties with Treasury rules.
The latest deal involves a proposal from Westinghouse Cubic, a maker of
revenue collection and control systems, to supply automatic gates for busy
stations on the Underground including Harrow-on-the-Hill, Uxbridge,
Whitechapel, Hammersmith, Balham and Morden. The others are East Ham,
Edgware, Tooting Broadway, Gants Hill, Leyton and Plaistow.
Treasury talks are understood to have run into problems over the transfer of
risk to Westinghouse Cubic. The Underground is believed to have suggested
that payments be linked to the number of passengers using the stations, but
the Treasury wanted it tied to the success of the gates in reducing fraud.
London Underground said that if agreement on the leasing deal could not be
reached, it would fund the project from its own resources if forced to. It
was, however, hopeful of reaching Treasury agreement.
London Underground is keen to extend the use of gates to combat fraud, which
costs it Pounds 30m a year.
The government has attempted for several years to persuade the private
sector to finance public transport infrastructure schemes, but with only
limited success.
A private finance panel was set up last autumn to identify promising
projects and remove blockages to implementation.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Beef ban threat begins to hit trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German threats to impose a ban on British beef imports because of fears over
'mad cow' disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) had already had
'disastrous' effects on the meat trade for at least one company, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday.
'It is having a disastrous effect on the company's trade with Germany and
affecting inquiries from elsewhere. I'm simply not having it,' she said.
Mrs Shephard is preparing a dossier for her German counterparts on the
effect of renewed publicity over BSE on meat exports.
Germany has called for a special session of European Union health ministers
this month to discuss a ban on British beef imports. Mrs Shephard said she
hoped the Germans would withdraw their request because it is supported by no
other EU member country.
Mr Mike Roper, export manager of Buchan Meats in Turriff, Aberdeenshire,
said business with Germany had fallen 15 per cent in the past year because
of renewed fears over BSE as well as the recession.
He said: 'We provide a guarantee that our beef is BSE-free, but this is a
popular issue in Germany and there is a lot of concern about it.'
Germany imported about 900,000 tonnes of beef last year, but only 1,000
tonnes was from Britain - less than 1 per cent of total British beef exports
to the EU. British beef exports to the EU - 126,000 tonnes last year - have
only begun to take off in recent years.
The German health ministry said yesterday it would take no unilateral action
to ban British beef if the planned meeting of EU health ministers could
prove that no risks were involved in importing meat which may be
contaminated with BSE.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Peace slips further from grasp: A look at the damage to the
talks process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and Irish ministers will meet in London today in the aftermath of
last night's failed IRA mortar spectacular. They will be even more
determined to demonstrate that there will be no let up in the search for
peace in Northern Ireland. Privately, however, they concede they face a long
hard haul.
The window of opportunity, opened with December's Downing Street
declaration, appears to be creaking shut. The early hopes of imminent peace,
today even more difficult to sustain, have become bogged down in political
diversions which threaten to derail the two governments' initiative.
For London and Dublin, the challenge more than ever is to keep the show on
the road, to build on the genuine consensus which now exists between the two
governments and to insist that their broader, bolder objectives will not be
sidetracked by mortars or sub-plots. It is not going to be easy.
The wave of mass killings last autumn, which gave impetus to intensified
Anglo-Irish efforts to forge a durable settlement, has subsided, lowering
the sense of urgency which underpinned a renewed readiness among the
province's political parties to compromise.
On the political front, the European elections beckon. As a result, the
province's main political parties are already adopting a markedly more
aggressive tone in discussing the prospects for a settlement. The Ulster
Unionists are particularly mindful of the need to protect their flank
against the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionists.
London has all but abandoned hope of reaching the stage where round-table
talks between Ulster's main non-violent parties and the two governments can
be resurrected until the elections are out of the way. In Dublin there is
also, in the words of one Northern Ireland Office official, 'an acute
awareness of the Ulster calendar'. In addition, the lengthening silence from
Sinn Fein - punctuated by potentially murderous assaults - is increasingly
being seen in both capitals as the republican movement's way of saying no to
the declaration.
A surprise acceptance or semi-acceptance, even now, has not been completely
ruled out. But few expect anything from Sinn Fein that would enable any
significant headway to be made this side of Euro-polling day on June 9.
Not surprisingly, both governments are playing down expectations for today's
session. All the more so since attention is expected to focus on strand two
of the three-stranded process: relations between Dublin and the north.
This, by common consent, is the most difficult circle the talks process will
have to square.
As Lord Fitt, the former leader of the Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, told his fellow peers last week: 'It is strand two that will
cause all the difficulties. It has done so in the past and will undoubtedly
do the same again in the future.'
Today's meeting will take stock of the position, which was in effect done at
last weekend's meeting in Dublin between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish Foreign minister. It will also
discuss progress made by the liaison committee, set up after last month's
so-called Twickenham summit between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in reaching a common position on
the way ahead.
But it is thought too early for significant progress to have been made,
making it difficult to publicly demonstrate that the initiative is gathering
momentum.
Today's meeting will not attract the fanfare that surrounded the Downing
Street declaration or the publicity generated by last night's airport raid.
But, although peace is apparently as elusive as ever, the intervening two
months has done nothing to undermine the quiet determination in London and
Dublin to try to finish what they started in September.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Heathrow attack a reminder of IRA capabilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Heathrow attack served as a potentially devastating reminder of the
IRA's continuing capability to strike on the British mainland and to extract
maximum publicity for its cause, Michael Cassell and Jimmy Burns write.
The mortar assault, although it ended in failure, inevitably gave rise to
speculation that an attack on such a high-profile, security-sensitive target
provides the IRA's answer to the Downing Street declaration.
The organisation prides itself on its independent cell structure which gives
considerable autonomy to on-the-ground 'active service units'. But security
sources believe it unlikely that such an attack would be planned and mounted
without the knowledge of the higher echelons of the IRA command.
MI5 and Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist experts have been privately warning
for months of the possibility of another 'big one' on the mainland to raise
the political stakes.
According to security experts, last night's attack would have been planned
over several weeks, using an active unit of about three people and an
intelligence and support team of at least twice that number.
The mortars and explosive material are likely to have been assembled in at
least one mainland safe-house or depot although the decision to activate the
operation would have come within 24 hours of the attack.
In spite of an impression that the IRA wound down activities in the period
after the joint declaration, the reality is that its campaign has continued
throughout. Until last night, however, it had been confined to Ulster.

FT  10 MAR 94 / MPs may question Thatcher over Pergau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, PAUL TAYLOR and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs investigating Britain's offer of Pounds 234m of aid for Malaysia's
Pergau dam have not ruled out the prospect of summoning Baroness Thatcher
before them in the next few weeks to answer questions on the affair.
Members of the Commons foreign affairs committee, which is investigating the
aid deal, discussed the possibility of summoning the former prime minister
at a private meeting yesterday. The committee confirmed that Lord Howe,
foreign secretary when an offer of aid to Malaysia was first discussed, had
agreed to give evidence to the committee in the next two weeks. It agreed
that a final decision on whether to ask Lady Thatcher to give testimony
would be taken after his appearance.
One committee member said yesterday: 'We discussed Lady Thatcher, but we
decided it would be premature to make a decision at this stage. We want to
see how we progress.'
The committee has interviewed the main participants in the decision to go
ahead with the aid deal, including Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
and Lord Younger, who as defence secretary signed a Pounds 1bn arms deal
which was 'briely entangled' with the aid package in March 1988. The
committee's report should be finished in May or June.
Some committee members believe that more evidence is needed to shed light on
decision-making on the aid offer, which was described by a senior Foreign
Office official as an 'abuse' of the aid system.
The committee also agreed yesterday to call officials from Balfour Beatty
and Cementation, the construction companies that were contracted to help
build the dam. It will also take evidence from pressure groups including
Friends of the Earth and the World Development Movement.
A spokeswoman for Lady Thatcher said yesterday that she was 'not saying
anything on this subject whatsoever' and she did not comment on invitations
until they had been received.
Meanwhile, BICC, the British cables and construction group which owns
Balfour Beatty, said it had received assurances that a Pounds 70m civil
engineering contract for work on the new Pounds 3bn Kuala Lumpur airport
would not be affected by Malaysia's ban on UK companies participating in new
government contracts.
Balfour Beatty said it had a letter of intent covering earthworks at the
airport site before the ban was imposed. Sir Robin Biggam, BICC's chairman,
said Mr Peter Mason, Balfour Beatty's chief executive, had visited Malaysia
last week and was told by the government it wanted Balfour to go ahead with
the project.
On prospects for further contracts Sir Robin said: 'The future is uncertain
but we are hoping for the best.'
Alexander Nicoll writes: British exports to Asia rose 29 per cent last year
to about Pounds 13bn from Pounds 10bn in 1992, and the region is receiving
higher priority in the commercial efforts of the Foreign Office, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, said yesterday.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Mayhew defends N Ireland committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew last night insisted that the establishment of a Northern
Ireland select committee would have 'no adverse effect whatsoever' on the
Ulster talks process.
The Northern Ireland secretary made the assertion as MPs voted to set up
such a committee by a majority of 103 (324-221). A Labour amendment to give
the body more powers than those proposed by the government was defeated by
58 votes (298-240).
The move will be widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's
commitment to the province's unionist majority.
Another cross-party committee of MPs will now deliberate on the detailed
composition of the new body, which may start work soon after Easter.
According to Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, ministers have
recommended that 13 MPs should sit on it and that the government should be
expected 'to be able to command a majority'.
The Tory proposals are thought to call for six of the 13 members to be
Conservatives, with the government's effective majority kept intact by the
presence of Sir James Kilfedder, the usually loyal Ulster Popular Unionist
MP for North Down.
Sir Patrick was goaded into his one-sentence intervention in last night's
debate by a Social Democratic and Labour party claim that government consent
for the committee was a 'political act'.
Mr Eddie McGrady, SDLP MP for South Down, urged MPs to reject the
government's proposal and support political talks between Northern Ireland's
main political parties and the peace process 'against which this proposal
will impact'.
Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, accused the government
of allowing short-term party interest to take priority over the peace
process.
The 'primary reason' that the government had conceded a select committee was
the need to maintain the 'understanding' reached with the Ulster Unionist
party in return for the support of its nine MPs in crucial Maastricht votes.
Mr McNamara also complained bitterly about the government's proposals for
Labour to have only two seats on the committee and the SDLP only one.
Ministers were proposing to 'gerrymander the composition of the committee,'
he said.
Opposition concerns were partly echoed by Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Tory
MP for Leominster, who warned that the move would be perceived as
'integrationist'.
Mr William McCrea, the hardline Democratic Unionist MP for Mid Ulster, said
he was 'delighted' that MPs would now have the right to scrutinise Northern
Ireland ministers. 'Direct rule is remote. Ministers have to be brought to
book,' he said.

Ms Karen Bishop, 17, was awarded more than Pounds 24,000 damages yesterday
after winning a sex discrimination case against Cooper Thames Ditton, a BMW
car franchise holder based in Surrey.
An industrial tribunal in Croydon, south London, decided she had been
unfairly denied a mechanic's apprenticeship in favour of two 16-year-old
boys because she was female. She was 15 at the time.
Ms Bishop said after the hearing: 'I passed my test two weeks ago and drive
a Mini. I might use some of the money on a new car, but it won't be a BMW.'

The creditors' committee to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce

give its verdict on a proposed new agreement with the government of Abu
Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder.
Representatives met the liquidators from accountants Touche Ross to learn
for the first time details of the agreement which was reached in the past
few days.
The settlement would include a payment of about Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn)
from Abu Dhabi and a restructuring of its claims against BCCI in exchange
for agreement by the liquidators not to be sued.
The agreement had to be renegotiated following a surprise rejection of the
original by the Luxembourg appeals court in October.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Rethink on crime payouts rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is determined to press ahead with changes to the criminal
injuries compensation scheme, in spite of claims that the reforms will
unjustly reduce payments to victims, Kevin Brown writes.
A senior official said there was no question of a rethink on the proposed
changes, which would replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff.
Labour said yesterday that the tariff would reduce payments to sexually
abused children, families of murder victims and injured police.
The reforms have been criticised in the Lords, where peers said they could
be unconstitutional and open to judicial review.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is understood to have taken legal
advice which supports the government view that the changes can be
implemented in April as planned.
Downing Street insisted that the scheme would remain the most generous in
Europe.
Officials said that some payments would rise. Compensation for aggravated
rape will rise from an average of Pounds 9,500 to Pounds 10,000, and
payments for facial scarring will rise from an average of Pounds 6,000 to
Pounds 7,500.
However, there was unrest among Conservative backbenchers about the
government's admission that the reforms will cut the cost of the scheme from
some Pounds 500m to about Pounds 250m a year.
It was also disclosed in the Lords last night that Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary, is considering extending the changes - which
apply to England, Wales and Scotland - to Ulster.

Attempts by Labour leaders to secure a new cross-party consensus on
anti-terrorism legislation ended in acrimony and recrimination in the
Commons last night.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, seized on the mortar bomb attack on
Heathrow airport in a vain appeal to Labour MPs not to vote against an order
renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act for a further 12 months.
To government cheers, he said that if the attack was meant to send 'some
signal to the House' MPs of all parties should respond by joining together
in voting for the order.
Labour MPs ignored the home secretary's appeal, angered by his rejection of
their pleas for an inquiry by a senior judge into the provisions permitting
terrorist suspects to be detained for questioning for up to seven days, and
for those from Northern Ireland to be excluded from mainland Britain.
The order was approved with a government majority of 86 (328-242).
Mr Howard infuriated Labour MPs by repeatedly insisting that their main
objective was to escape the political consequences of continuing to vote
against the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
In a series of clashes Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, accused Mr
Howard of 'ranting' in the hope of securing party advantage by accentuating
the divide between the two main parties.
Mr Blair suggested that the government's partisan approach had been
signalled in advance of the debate by the leaking of information about last
week's confidential talks on the operation of the act between Mr John Smith,
the Labour leader, and Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Like the prime minister, Mr Howard denied that the leak originated from the
Home Office, either through civil servants or political advisers, or other
government sources.
Mr Smith issued a statement underlining his dissatisfaction with the outcome
of the inquiry ordered by the prime minister, which had been carried out 'in
little more than 24 hours'. He added: 'I remain deeply disturbed both at the
leak and at Mr Major's failure to discover its source.'
Mr David Trimble, chief spokesman in the debate for the Ulster Unionists,
reaffirmed support for the renewal of the act but agreed with some points
made by Labour.
He suggested that a judicial officer, with a role similar to that of
procurators fiscal in Scotland, should be involved in authorising the
detention of terrorist suspects for as long as seven days.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Scott queries Customs' methods in Matrix case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The role of Customs and Excise in investigating alleged breaches of export
regulations in the Matrix Churchill case was challenged yesterday by Lord
Justice Scott.
The judge questioned whether Customs had gained a sufficiently 'rounded
picture' of the facts of the case before prosecuting three businessmen for
illegally exporting defence-related machine tools to Iraq.
He was speaking after taking oral evidence from Mr Peter Wiltshire, senior
investigating officer in the Matrix Churchill case.
Mr Wiltshire told the inquiry that he and Customs lawyers prepared their
prosecution without taking statements from Whitehall officials directly
involved in the licensing arrangements for Matrix Churchill exports. He also
admitted that Customs either ignored or delayed circulating some
intelligence reports relevant to the case that had been provided by MI6.
These reports included details about the extent to which Matrix Churchill
businessmen had been supplying information to the intelligence services.
Mr Wiltshire said that he had gathered evidence that the Matrix Churchill
businessmen had deceived Department of Trade and Industry licensing
officials about the nature of the machine tools they were exporting. But the
judge said Customs had the responsibility to fully test the defence case -
that the machine tools had been exported with the tacit agreement of the
government.
The judge asked Mr Wiltshire: 'If the truth was that the DTI didn't mind . .
. shouldn't you have investigated the background to see whether this was
likely to be the case?' Mr Wiltshire said a trawl of official papers
convinced him that no one in government 'really knew' what Matrix Churchill
was up to.
The hearing continues today.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Railtrack warns of cut in subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private operators running trains will be forced to make big efficiency gains
as subsidies are reduced, a director of Railtrack, the state-owned company
set up to take over responsibility for British Rail's track and signalling,
will warn today.
Although the government has promised to increase subsidies in line with
higher track charges, Sir Christopher Foster, a Railtrack director, says the
operators' ability to make efficiency gains will reduce the need for big
rail subsidies.
In a speech to be delivered today to the University of Leeds, Sir
Christopher will say that a commitment by the government to provide a
subsidy to sustain rail services 'is not the same as saying that the current
level of real subsidy should be maintained'. He believes that after the
first year the government will reduce the Pounds 930m annual subsidy as the
new train operators will be expected to make improvements to BR's
'old-established working practices'.
Sir Christopher, who helped shape railway privatisation as a special adviser
to the Department of Transport, says some of the potential entrants have put
forward ideas on how to improve working practices. He believes railway
timetables - which at present take BR up to 18 months to change - and
scheduling of trains could be radically altered. He says this could save
private operators significant amounts of money.
He says that in the long term rolling stock companies, which are to be sold
off separately, may find the government cutting the subsidy. Sir Christopher
adds that it would not be in the taxpayers' interest if companies bidding
for the rolling stock companies did not think that the government was
planning to cut back demand through reduced subsidy.
While the government's plan is to open up rail franchises to competition,
Sir Christopher confirms that it is likely to be controlled in the
short-term.
Ministers are anxious to avoid the open competition triggered by bus
privatisation, where fierce rivalry erupted on city-centre routes, clogging
traffic and leading to a poorer service.
Sir Christopher says that in the long term rail operators wanting to run
trains on lucrative routes may have to pay the franchisee a fee towards the
operation of unremunerative services.
Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering yesterday won the Pounds 60m main contract
to build the underground stations and tunnels for the Heathrow Express
project, Paul Betts writes.
The Pounds 300m joint project by BAA, the privatised airports group, and BR
is to construct an express rail link between Heathrow and the centre of
London.
The service, scheduled to start operating in December 1997, will mean that
the world's busiest international airport can be reached from Paddington
Station in 16 minutes.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Security fears revived at vital strategic target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the City of London, which has been struck by two IRA attacks in the
past two years, Heathrow airport is an important target both economically
and symbolically.
It is the world's busiest international airport, handling more than 42m
passengers a year, and is one of the UK's most important assets.
It handles 40 per cent of all passenger traffic through UK airports, while
Heathrow's World Cargo Centre is second only to the port of Dover in terms
of the value of goods handled, with the equivalent of Pounds 34bn in visible
trade.
Heathrow is a significant employer - 50,000 people work at the airport,
including 1,400 security staff, and an estimated 20,000 local jobs exist as
a direct result of airport activity.
Eighty different airlines use the airport, serving more than 200
destinations, with more than 370,000 aircraft movements a year.
Closure of Heathrow for a whole day, for example as the result of terrorist
action, could ground about 1,000 flights leaving up to 100,000 passengers
stranded. Repeated closures that damaged its reputation for reliability
could cost the airport hundreds of millions of pounds in lost business.
Heathrow is also the centre of a thriving local hotel and conference
industry, with 20 hotels offering about 5,000 beds in the immediate
vicinity.
The incident last night was the first mortar attack on mainland Britain
since the IRA used home-made firing tubes to bomb a cabinet meeting in
Downing Street in February 1991.
Previous mortars have consisted of a 9in-diameter, 3ft-long steel tube. The
apparently improvised weapon used last night has an even longer firing tube
for greater accuracy and range. In the past the weapons have been used most
effectively at ranges of between 400m and 500m. While two bombs landed on
the runway without detonating, their firing point in the car park of the
Excelsior Hotel would have brought a number of sensitive targets within
range.
One potential target from this position is the traffic tunnel under the
runway that acts as the main thoroughfare into the terminal areas.
Security within the airport perimeter fence was stepped up during the 1970s
due to the IRA threat and again in 1986 when police began carrying machine
guns in the airport lounges after terrorist attacks at Vienna and Rome
airports. The Excelsior Hotel, sited on a public road north of the airport,
does not enjoy the protection afforded inside the fence.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Wider financial regulatory net urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of savings products such as Tessas, which were seen as alternatives
to investment products, should be included in the retail financial services
regulatory regime, a Standard Life executive told MPs yesterday.
Mr Jim Stretton, the life insurance company's deputy managing director, told
the cross-party Commons treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation
that the rules should cover all products which seemed to be in competition
with each other. These included some of the building societies' savings
vehicles, which customers saw as quite similar to unit trusts.
Mr Stretton again signalled that Standard Life was likely to join the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private
investors, in spite of the company's preference for a single-tier statutory
regulator. He resigned from the PIA board because most of its members would
not come from the financial services industry so, he said, it would not be
real self-regulation.
He expressed some sympathy for proposals by Mr George Greener, chairman of
Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, for a single regulator in which an executive
committee of people working in financial services was supervised by a board
of public interest directors.
He made it clear, however, that he did not believe there was enough common
ground among the PIA's opponents to prevent the watchdog becoming
operational in the summer.

FT  10 MAR 94 / NUM in ballot on new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Union of Mineworkers yesterday started balloting its Yorkshire
members over merger plans which, if defeated, would spell the end for the
union's structure.
A close vote could even bring into question Mr Arthur Scargill's presidency,
although those campaigning against the executive admitted yesterday that
such an outcome was unlikely.
The merger vote has been brought to a head because the NUM, which had
245,000 members in 1982, has about 8,000 members, nearly 6,000 of whom work
in the Yorkshire area.
This has led to rationalisation plans including the takeover of the
Yorkshire area's Pounds 5.8m assets to help ease the union's financial
crisis.
A ballot is necessary to achieve the merger because of the NUM's federal
structure.
Mr John Walsh, agent and assistant general secretary of the Yorkshire area,
dismissed in January but still in post pending an appeal, has said that he
has been victimised for campaigning against the transfer, saying it will be
detrimental to the union.
Mr Walsh believes the union's national headquarters in Sheffield is
virtually penniless.
He said: 'I think it will be almost down to the reserve fund by now and that
can only be used to back up the pension schemes. It has fixed assets
probably of about Pounds 2m but it can't sell the building because nobody
wants it.'
The NUM executive has said in a letter to Yorkshire members that a merger
will avoid an increase in contributions and save the area and the national
union Pounds 200,000 in administrative costs alone.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Search for peace faces long hard haul: Early hopes for an
Ulster settlement are bogged down in political diversions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and Irish ministers will meet in London today anxious to demonstrate
publicly that there will be no slacking in the search for peace in Northern
Ireland. Privately, however, they concede they may face a long hard haul.
The window of opportunity, opened with December's historic Downing Street
declaration, appears to be creaking shut. The early hopes of imminent peace
have become bogged down in political diversions which threaten to derail the
two governments' initiative.
For London and Dublin, the challenge is to keep the show on the road, to
build on the genuine consensus which now exists between the two governments
and to insist that their broader, bolder objectives will not be sidetracked
by sub-plots. It is not going to be easy.
The wave of mass killings last autumn, which gave impetus to intensified
Anglo-Irish efforts to forge a durable settlement, has subsided, lowering
the sense of urgency which underpinned a renewed readiness among the
province's political parties to compromise.
On the political front, the European elections beckon. As a result, the
province's main political parties - headed by the Ulster Unionists (mindful
of the need to protect their flank against the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline
Democratic Unionists) - are already adopting a markedly more aggressive tone
in discussing the prospects for a settlement. It is the season for
retreating into entrenched positions.
London has all but abandoned hope of reaching the stage where round-table
talks between Ulster's main non-violent parties and the two governments can
be resurrected until the elections are out of the way. In Dublin there is
also, in the words of one Northern Ireland Office official, 'an acute
awareness of the Ulster calendar'.
In addition, the lengthening silence from Sinn Fein is increasingly being
seen in both capitals as the republican movement's way of saying no to the
declaration.
A surprise acceptance has not been completely ruled out and any positive
initiative by republican leaders could produce another twist in the
political game now being played out. But few expect anything from Sinn Fein
which will enable any significant headway to be made this side of
Euro-polling day on June 9.
Not surprisingly, both governments are accordingly playing down expectations
for today's session. All the more so since attention is expected to focus on
strand two of the three-stranded process: relations between Dublin and the
north.
This, by common consent, is the most difficult - or as one participant puts
it, the most intellectually challenging - circle the talks process will have
to square.
As Lord Fitt, the former leader of the Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
party, told his fellow peers last week: 'It is strand two that will cause
all the difficulties. It has done so in the past and will undoubtedly do the
same again in the future.'
Today's meeting will take stock of the position, in effect already done at
last weekend's meeting in Dublin between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish Foreign minister. It will also
discuss progress made by the liaison committee, set up after last month's
so-called Twickenham summit between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in reaching a common position on
the way ahead.
But it is thought too early for significant progress to have been made,
making it difficult to publicly demonstrate that the initiative is gathering
momentum.
Today's meeting will not attract the fanfare which surrounded the Downing
Street declaration. But, although peace is apparently as elusive as ever,
the intervening two months has done nothing to undermine the quiet
determination in London and Dublin to finish what they started in September.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Merseyside told to rethink EU bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission in Brussels has rejected government proposals for
spending Pounds 690m of EU money to revive Merseyside's flagging regional
economy.
The commission argues that the plans, submitted late last year and calling
for about half the money to go into training, concentrate too much on
solutions which have already failed and show policies for obtaining EU funds
rather than regenerating the area.
Brussels officials have told civil servants and Merseyside political leaders
to rethink their strategy to give a bigger role to the private sector, which
had complained about lack of involvement, and to concentrate on five 'growth
drivers' - human resources, cultural industries, large industries,
knowledge-based business, and small and medium-sized companies.
The five-year 'Objective 1' status money offers funds to areas which has a
gross domestic product per person under 75 per cent of the EU average.
Rejection of the plans was welcomed by Mr Alan Arthur, chairman of coatings
business King and Fowler and organiser of a 500-company local private-sector
pressure group backed by the Confederation of British Industry.
He said: 'Business people need to be able to use this opportunity. So far it
has looked like only benefiting every advisory body and consultant who was
ever born.'

The dispute over US access to the Japanese cellular phone market - at the
centre of Washington's threats of trade sanctions - appeared to have been
defused yesterday. The Japanese group IDO said it had reached a broad
agreement with Motorola to expand the US company's cellular phone network,
writes Paul Abrahams in Tokyo. Motorola has been trying for almost a decade
to become a significant force in the Japanese mobile phone market.
IDO, partly owned by Toyota, said the two companies were near agreement over
the timing and extent of the expansion of the Motorola network. The Japanese
company is offering to add 159 relay stations for Motorola's car phones. Mr
Arnold Brenner, Motorola's vice-president, who arrived in Tokyo yesterday to
finalise the agreement, wants the expansion completed within 18 months. The
Japanese group says it will take more than two years. Discussions over the
allocation of radio frequencies also need to be concluded.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Kantor hits back at EU critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday attacked the
European Union for its criticism of the Clinton administration's Japan
policy and invited it to take part in US-Japan talks.
'Europeans are always delighted when they can hold our coats and we go out
to get our noses bloodied,' he told the Economic Strategy Institute. The US
was ready to 'trilateralise or multilateralise' its talks with Japan, 'but
we don't look for criticism from those who sit on the sidelines and don't
get in the game'.
He said he could not define the 'managed trade' the EU was accusing the US
of adopting. He pointed sarcastically to 'voluntary restraint on cars and
trucks at 16 per cent in Europe? That wouldn't be managed trade, would it?'
The EU telecommunications procurement and broadcast directives also curbed
imports, he said. 'Every time it's in their interest to engage in behaviour
which is not opening their markets, that's justified.'
On Japan, Mr Kantor said there had been 'interesting movement' in the
dispute over cellular telephones. He was awaiting documents from Tokyo, he
said, and implied the agreement would have the kind of 'quantitative
indicators' the US insisted on in the broader trade framework talks.
Japan had failed to honour its promise to stimulate its economy, he claimed.
'They adopted a tax rebate proposal for one year and then tried to figure
out how to pay for it. The definition of a stimulus is that you stimulate
your economy and you don't pay for it.'
On other subjects, he said:
The US would ask the new World Trade Organisation, the proposed Gatt
successor, to adopt a multilateral version of the US Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act to prohibit bribery of foreign officials.
The US would seek the adoption of fair labour standards.
He was hopeful that the declining trend in US semiconductor sales in Japan
had been reversed in the fourth quarter of last year, but would move swiftly
if it had not.
The US-EU audio visual dispute had to be dealt with 'industry-to-industry
and then government-to-government'.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Japanese clear way for Jeep

Japan is expected to clear the way today for the US vehicle manufacturer
Chrysler to boost substantially its exports to Japan of Jeep Cherokee sports
utility vehicles, in what appears to be part of a campaign to ease trade
tensions.
Chrysler said yesterday that it had been told at short notice that a
vice-minister in the Transport Ministry would present the company with a
'type certificate' at a meeting in Detroit today.
The certificate allows Chrysler's distributor in Japan to carry out
road-worthiness inspections of Cherokees rather than having to submit each
vehicle for certification by the Transport Ministry.
US car manufacturers have long complained that the ministry inspections are
an important non-tariff trade barrier.
Chrysler, which was told some time ago that it was likely to get a type
certificate, plans to boost its Japanese sales of Cherokees from 4,000 a
year to 10,000. However, a spokeswoman said yesterday that Japan still had a
long way to go to open up its vehicle market.

South Korea's leading carmaker, Hyundai, is planning to increase capacity by
60 per cent to 2m units by the year 2000, Mr Se Yung Chung, chairman, said
yesterday. Current global production capacity was 1.25m units, 1.15m in
Korea and 100,000 overseas, he told The Economist motor conference in
Geneva.
The group produced 960,000 vehicles last year with domestic sales of 620,000
and exports of 350,000. It controls close to half the domestic market.
Mr Chung said Hyundai was planning to build more foreign production sites to
reinforce its presence in overseas markets. 'We envision manufacturing
operations in North America, Europe, south-east Asia and in the Middle
East.'
The company also intended to shift the emphasis in its new car development
programme 'away from smaller passenger cars to put more weight on the
development of higher value-added vehicles'.
Production capacity would rise by 110,000 vehicles this year and
construction had just begun on a bus and heavy duty truck plant in Chonju.
The entire South Korean motor industry has embarked on a period of rapid
expansion of capacity and is moving quickly to expand its presence in
foreign markets.
Hyundai is seeking to cut its dependence on Mitsubishi of Japan for engine
technology. Mr Chung said that 'in the not too distant future all Hyundai
vehicles will be equipped with engines and transmissions of Hyundai's
proprietary design'.
The company was seeking 'technological independence' so that its survival
could not be challenged.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Suzuki to export cars from India - Geneva
Motor Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suzuki, the Japanese carmaker, is to begin exporting cars to west Europe
from India. Later this year it will launch in Europe its Alto minicar
produced by Maruti Udyog, its Indian production base.
The car was launched last summer in India, where it is sold as the Maruti
Zen. The Alto is the first model Suzuki has developed at an overseas
production base for introduction in overseas markets.
Maruti Udyog is India's largest car manufacturer and was the first
large-scale Japanese-Indian joint venture. It is 50/50 owned by Suzuki and
the Indian government. Maruti is expanding its production capacity from
130,000 vehicles a year at present to 200,000 by the end of the year in
order to expand sales in both the domestic and export markets.
This spring it will produce its one millionth vehicle since it began
production in 1983 under India's 'people's car plan'. It controls 70 per
cent of the Indian car market.
Suzuki's move to begin supplying the European market from India comes at a
time when it is has run into serious problems with its production plant in
Spain, where it assembles small four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles,
the Vitara and the SJ series.
Santana Motor, its 82 per cent owned Spanish subsidiary has recently applied
for protection from creditors under pressure of mounting losses, and Suzuki
has threatened to close the plant unless it receives state aid. Suzuki also
has an assembly plant in Hungary, from which it will export cars to west
Europe next month.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt seeks to expand its HQ in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
High-level negotiations are taking place between the Swiss government and
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on practical and financial
arrangements for Gatt's change of status next year to a fully-fledged World
Trade Organisation. Office accommodation, meeting facilities, parking and
the issue of diplomatic status for senior officials top Gatt's list of
concerns.
Trade officials warned that if satisfactory arrangements were not made the
WTO could look for another home. 'Negotiations are going fairly well. The
Swiss recognise the need to keep the WTO in town,' one official said
yesterday.
Competition for international agencies, including financial inducements, has
intensified in recent years, partly for reasons of prestige but also because
of the boost to the local economy. International organisations and diplomats
account for 9 per cent of employment in Geneva and bring in SFr1.5bn (Pounds
702m) a year to the Swiss city.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, former Gatt director-general and now chairman of a new
private foundation to promote Geneva as an international centre, is said to
be playing a behind-the-scenes role in the negotiations.
Office accommodation is one key factor. The size of the WTO's staff is
certain to be much larger than the 450 now employed by Gatt. Gatt wants to
expand into the whole of its present lakeside building, part of which is now
occupied by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Though the UNHCR is due to move into purpose-built offices this September,
these were planned when the agency was much smaller and there is now not
enough room for all 800 headquarters employees.
Berne has, however, already approved SFr34m to build a new WTO council room.
The present one can no longer accommodate delegates from all Gatt's 116
member nations plus observers.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US seeks 'fairer' export control - A look
at proposals to lift cold war-based curbs on trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From its inception, the administration of President Bill Clinton has made
business its business - in particular high -technology business - and
competitiveness has been given the highest priority.
Despite budget stringency, millions of dollars are flowing into
public-private technology partnerships, Mr Clinton's people fought their
labour and liberal allies to clinch the North American Free Trade Agreement
and the Uruguay Round and officials roam the world hawking contracts for US
companies.
There has, however, been one big disappointment for business. With the end
of the cold war, exporters had high hopes that Mr Clinton would lighten one
of their heaviest burdens: export controls on dual-use and high-technology
products.
Last month Mr Clinton announced proposals for a much-delayed Export
Administration Act, the law governing export controls, and called for
far-reaching licensing liberalisation. The aim has shifted from denying
products to communist nations to controlling the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
Mr Clinton's proposal calls for strengthening the role of the US Commerce
Department in the approval process. It seeks a rigorous evaluation of
controls, including their economic impact, before they are imposed; the
lifting of old controls that are clearly ineffectual; and simplification of
the licensing process, which would result in an answer to the most
controversial applications within 90 days.
It would introduce the concept of 'unfair impact', allowing industry to
petition for removal of controls based on whether similar products might be
available from other suppliers abroad, on competitive disadvantage or
ineffectiveness of the control.
Business reaction to these proposals have ranged from unimpressed to
hostile. Many computer companies say that no unilateral controls are
necessary because computers have been found to do nothing to aid weapons
proliferation.
Mr Howard Lewis, vice-president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said that without a total overhaul licensing could cost the
US Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.5bn) a year in exports by the mid-1990s.
But the president's plan 'would create a system of unilateral controls
loosely co-ordinated with other countries. It would not establish clear
authority and accountability for running the system. And it would not do
enough to tell US companies clearly what, and to whom, not to export', he
said.
Mr Peter McCloskey, president of the Electronic Industries Association, said
the proposed EAA was 'woefully inadequate'.
'Rapidly changing product life cycles necessitate an export control system
that can react quickly and focus only on those technologies that are
critical for the development of weapons of mass destruction,' he said.
Industry has taken its case to Congress where favoured legislation,
sponsored by Delaware Senator William Roth and Minnesota Congressman James
Oberstar, is to be written by a House banking committee today.
This bill would do away with all national security controls imposed
unilaterally on the grounds that critical technologies can best be curbed by
co-operation between supplier countries. It would strengthen international
export controls by extending preferential treatment to countries which agree
to abide by common standards of licensing and enforcement.
It wants business input in multilateral negotiations to establish stricter
controls on a smaller list of strategic commodities.
'Excessively long control lists only spur resistance from allies and
ultimately hinder the effectiveness of control regimes,' said the Coalition
for Fundamental Reform of the Export Control System.
While business is pushing for a multilateral solution, the US and its allies
in the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls are meeting
in Paris this week to wind up the organisation's affairs. CoCom is to go out
of business on March 31, and with no great common enemy to unite them, the
allies are far from agreeing a successor organisation.
Russia is to join the new group, which will focus on controls of dual-use
goods and conventional arms to outlaw regimes such as Iran, Iraq, and North
Korea. In the absence of agreement, the US has been expected to propose
continuation of the current control lists.
Meanwhile, Congress must either hope that one day an effective multilateral
regime will be in place, muddle along with sporadic unilateral controls
which disadvantage US industry or lift all export licensing requirements
except for those products most egregiously dangerous.

<TEXT>
A judge has ruled that one of the late Robert Maxwell's companies had no
right to a claim against the New York Daily News, the tabloid newspaper
owned by Maxwell when he died, Reuter reports from New York.
The ruling, made on Tuesday and released yesterday, settled the final
dispute in the newspaper's bankruptcy that came shortly after Maxwell died
in November 1991.
Mirror Group Newspapers claimed the paper stole Dollars 92m (Pounds 63m)
from the group, saying Maxwell and his son, Kevin, took the money to run the
Daily News.
The US bankruptcy judge denied the Mirror claim, saying the Maxwells lied to
the tabloid's directors and their actions hurt the Daily News as well as the
Mirror Group.
The judge said the father and son engaged in an 'elaborate ruse', concealing
the source of money to the newspaper and planned to strip the tabloid of
even more money at a time when its ability to publish was in jeopardy.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Special counsel fails to win Whitewater accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel, and senior Republicans yesterday
failed in their first attempt to negotiate a compromise under which Congress
could hold hearings into the Whitewater affair.
Both Senator Al D'Amato from New York and Sen William Cohen from Maine
remained hopeful some resolution could be reached. Sen Cohen spoke of
delaying a congressional investigation and of not granting immunity from
prosecution to witnesses, if either made Mr Fiske's task easier.
The special counsel did not budge from his objection that hearings on
Capitol Hill could jeopardise the integrity of his own investigations.
But he conceded he could not stop Congress calling hearings. He also implied
he could work around them if they were confined to the question of meetings
between White House and regulatory officials on the status of Madison
Guaranty, the Arkansas savings bank at the heart of the Whitewater affair.
He added he was completely satisfied with White House co-operation to date.
The failed Arkansas savings and loan institution is at the centre of the
Whitewater allegations that Mr and Mrs Clinton engaged in improper financial
dealings in the 1980s.
The Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill seemed more determined than ever
yesterday to frustrate Republican wishes. Sen George Mitchell of Maine, the
majority leader, said the Republicans wanted to stage 'a political circus'
that would 'throw up a lot of dust and embarrass the president'.
Mr Fiske, Senator Mitchell said, 'is independent, is a Republican, was
selected at the request of Republicans and it's very clear, as he says, you
can't have both a congressional investigation and an independent
investigation'.
Press advice on the issue was mixed yesterday. The New York Times urged a
compromise that would give Mr Fiske 'a head start, probably measured in
weeks' before Congress got in on the act.
The Wall Street Journal, as ever virulently anti-Clinton, headlined its
comment yesterday: 'The Fiske Cover-up.' It pretty much demanded
fully-fledged hearings.
The president's press spokeswoman was forced to deny rumours in the New York
markets that Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, was about to
resign because he had participated in the SL meetings. He is among 10
officials under subpoena to testify in front of the federal grand jury
convened by Mr Fiske. Mr Clinton said yesterday he had advised the 10 to be
'very open' and tell everything they knew.
Several news organisations continued to report on the alleged shredding by
the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, where Mrs Hillary Clinton was a part ner,
of documents purportedly bearing the name of Vincent Foster, the deputy
White House legal counsel who com-mitted suicide last summer.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's interest rates rose for the second week running yesterday after
further volatility in the peso/dollar exchange rate, writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico City.
Rates on short-term government paper rose to 9.3 per cent, up 0.29
percentage points from last week.
The rise in rates came as the 48-hour peso/dollar buy rate closed at 3.26
after weakening to 3.30.
The peso has lost some 5 per cent of its value in a month, and has been
close to its central bank limit of 3.357. Currency traders blame the peso's
weakness on low economic growth, mounting political uncertainty in Mexico,
and higher interest rates in the US.
The low growth has encouraged the government - until the last two weeks - to
push interest rates down quickly.
The government's revised figures show growth fell 0.8 per cent in the third
quarter last year, and 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.

The 25-year domination of Antiguan politics by the Bird family will continue
with the victory of the incumbent Labour Party in last Tuesday's general
election.
Mr Lester Bird, the Labour leader, is to be sworn in as prime minister,
succeeding his 84-year-old father, Mr Vere Bird Sr, who has resigned.
Preliminary results have given the Labour Party 11 of the 17 seats in the
assembly.
The opposition United Progressive Party, which had one seat in the previous
parliament, took five, with the lone seat on the island of Barbuda going to
the People's Movement.
The campaign was dominated by charges from the opposition that the Labour
government's long control of the government had led to endemic corruption,
with the islands, whose economy is based on tourism, being used for drug
smuggling and money laundering.
Mr Lester Bird consistently rejected the charges during the campaign, but
promised to take a hard line against any impropriety in the government.
The new prime minister's early tasks will include a decision on the role, if
any, which his elder brother, Mr Vere Bird Jr, will play in politics.
Mr Bird Jr, who won a seat, was the central figure in a judicial inquiry
four years ago, in which it was alleged that he had used his office as a
government minister to facilitate the transhipment of Israeli arms to
Colombian drug cartels.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Clinton launches jobs plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled his plans to overhaul the US
unemployment system to retrain unemployed workers and move them back into
new jobs.
The plan would provide longer unemployment benefits for people who are
undertaking retraining, as well as laid-off workers who decided to open
their own businesses. Mr Clinton also promised to bring six separate state
and federal benefit, counselling and training programmes under a single
roof.
'The first element of the plan is to create one-stop shopping so workers can
go to one office and get the counselling and assistance they need,' Mr
Clinton said at a White House ceremony to launch the plan yesterday
afternoon.
The initiative, which is expected to face considerable modification in
Congress, is likely to be presented by the administration at next week's
Group of Seven jobs conference in Detroit as a centrepiece of efforts the US
is making to improve employment prospects.
While the US has generated far more jobs than the less flexible European
economies over the past decade, European governments have often suggested
that the US system conceals the real level of joblessness by simply cutting
off unemployment benefits after a relatively short period. They have also
criticised the inadequacy of US training schemes.
US officials this week have insisted that they want to move beyond that
1980s argument, insisting that each of the G7 countries can learn from the
others.
'We are still going to say to them in Europe that part of their problem
stems from the fact that their labour markets are very inflexible. . . . But
one of the places where we are going to learn the most is on training and
moving people from school to work, and we are going to learn a lot from the
Europeans on that,' said Mr Lewis Alexander, chief economist at the US
Commerce Department.
The plan put forward by Mr Clinton yesterday would provide benefits to
unemployed workers for up to two years of training, at a cost, when it is
fully phased in, of about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year.
US unemployment benefits usually run out after 26 weeks, although for much
of the last three years Congress has voted to extend benefits for between
seven and 33 additional weeks.
Mr Clinton said yesterday that the old unemployment benefits system was
designed to give people 'enough to live on until their old jobs came back
because most jobs were lost in ordinary cyclical recessions'.
That system was no longer adequate in an economy where three out of four
workers laid off last year expected never to get their old jobs back, he
said, and where the average US worker would change jobs seven or eight times
in a lifetime.

FT  10 MAR 94 / IADB members raise - and lower - the stakes: A look at a
capital-boosting deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and its Latin American partners have agreed to reduce their stake in
the Inter-American Development Bank as part of an accord to boost the bank's
capital by Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn).
The agreement, which will reduce the US shareholding in the bank to around
30 per cent from 34.6 per cent, also envisages the bank lifting its current
bar on lending to the private sector.
The capital increase, if details are finalised as expected at the bank's
annual meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, next month, would allow the bank's
non-regional members - particularly Japan and Germany - to expand their
small stakes in the institution.
Japan, which currently holds only 1.08 per cent of the bank's capital, has
been pressing for an expansion in its stake to reflect its financial support
for US initiatives in Latin America. The agreement is also expected to
provide Japan with an executive director on the board, which will be thus
expanded to 13 members.
As part of the accord, the borrowing members of the bank from Latin America
and the Caribbean will reduce their combined stake from 53.8 per cent to a
fraction over 50 per cent.
The Dollars 40bn increase should allow the bank to continue with a lending
programme of Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn a year for an indefinite period.
Only 2.5 per cent of the increase will be paid in by shareholders, the rest
being callable capital against which the bank will be able borrow in capital
markets. The increase in the stake of the non-regional shareholders will
reduce considerably the budget implications for the US, which is currently
Dollars 847m in arrears in its commitments to international institutions.
The bank's lending to the private sector will be limited to infrastructure
projects, with a ceiling probably of 5 per cent - Dollars 350m to Dollars
400m a year. The bank will only lend where the private sector is also
providing finance, and to a maximum 25 per cent of total lending.
Under the accord, the bank will double the proportion of its lending going
to so-called social sectors, such as primary health and education which are
now considered the central issue for the region's development. Some 50 per
cent of transactions (40 per cent by value of lending) will be directed to
these areas. The bank will also direct lending for the first time to improve
the quality of government - for instance, enhancing the region's judicial
systems.
Mr Enrique Iglesias, the bank's president, said the capital replenishment
accord was 'more than a capital increase. It's a redefinition of bank policy
to better respond to Latin America's problems.' However, there was still
much to do before the increase was finally agreed.
This includes completing discussions about the bank's soft-loan window, the
Fund for Special Operations, and resolving differences over whether another
seat on the board is required for the bank's Latin American members as
Chile, especially, is seeking.
However, a US Treasury official was optimistic that the issues could be
resolved by the Guadalajara meeting and remarked on the 'positive manner' in
which the discussions had been held.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Mexico rates up as peso weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's interest rates rose for the second consecutive week yesterday after
further volatility in the peso/dollar exchange rate.
Rates on short-term government paper rose to 9.3 per cent, an increase of 29
basis points from last week. The rise in rates came as the 48-hour
peso/dollar buy rate at one point weakened to 3.30 yesterday morning,
although it strengthened to 3.2750 at noon.
The peso has lost some 5 per cent in a month, and has been close to its
central bank limit of 3.357. Currency traders blame the peso's weakness on
low economic growth, mounting political uncertainty in Mexico, and higher
interest rates in the US.
The low growth has encouraged the government - until the last two weeks - to
push interest rates down quickly.
The government's revised figures show growth fell 0.8 per cent in the third
quarter last year, and 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. But as US
interest rates have risen, the spread between Mexican and US returns reached
historic lows. This has sharply cut the attraction of Mexican government
paper to foreign investors, according to Mr Joge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs,
the private US investment bank.
Other investors blame the weak currency on the uncertain political
landscape, especially the rumoured presidential ambitions of Mr Manuel
Camacho, the peace envoy to the troubled southern state of Chiapas. 'If
Camacho registers then there will be so much uncertainty that the exchange
rate may not hold within its band,' said a leading money market trader in
Mexico City.
A number of opposition political parties could replace their existing
presidential candidate with Mr Camacho up to a month before August's
election. Aides to Mr Camacho make it clear he has not ruled out running for
the presidency. His eventual decision may depend on support for Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio, the candidate of the governing party, in opinion polls.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Shekel curbs to go if inflation rate is reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TEL AVIV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel will make its currency, the shekel, fully convertible but only after
its inflation rate has moved much closer to those of its leading trading
partners, Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of Israel's central bank, said.
He also said he wanted further measures to liberalise the economy before
allowing Israelis and foreigners complete freedom to buy and sell the
currency.
However, Mr Frenkel made clear in an interview that the bank would move to
full convertibility as soon as possible but the move would have to be
sustainable and not subject to setbacks.
Israel has progressively liberalised its once strictly controlled foreign
exchange and money markets since the middle of the 1980s as part of a policy
of opening its economy to the outside world. But while trading in the shekel
for trade and business purposes is practically free of regulation, Israeli
residents still face restrictions on opening bank accounts and buying
property abroad.
Mr Frenkel said because of Israel's geo-political position, 'there is a lot
of vulnerability' in the economy. Full convertibility could expose Israel's
economy to 'very huge swings' of capital in and out of the country.
The experience of former communist countries that have rapidly made their
currencies convertible showed that premature action in this area was
counter-productive and inevitably forced a retreat, Mr Frenkel said.
Israel's inflation rate - currently about 10 per cent - would have to be
much closer to the 2 or 3 per cent inflation rates of the big industrialised
countries. This would be a precondition for making the exchange rate of the
shekel more stable.
Israel has set an 8 per cent inflation target this year and hopes to achieve
further staged reductions in inflation in the years ahead. Consistent with
its inflation target, the Bank of Israel pursues a 'crawling band' exchange
rate policy that envisages a 6 per cent depreciation of the shekel's value
against the currencies of its main trading partners this year.
Mr Frenkel said the bank was waiting to see the impact of new housing and
land policies on inflation but would not hesitate to raise interest rates
further if necessary to achieve the 8 per cent target for this year.
'We will not give any weight to questions of controversy in the conduct of
interest rate or monetary policy. It would be a mistake,' he said.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Japanese corruption probe widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese public prosecutors yesterday widened their investigation into
alleged corruption when they raided more than 30 homes and offices of
politicians and construction company executives, Paul Abrahams writes from
Tokyo.
The raids followed a request by prosecutors earlier this week for the
parliamentary immunity of Mr Kishiro Nakamura, a former Liberal Democratic
party construction minister, to be lifted so he could be arrested on charges
of bribery.
Mr Nakamura, whose home was among those raided, yesterday resigned from the
LDP. A decision about whether his immunity should be lifted must be made by
a full session of the lower house of parliament. It could give its consent
today. If the request is successful, it would be the first time since 1967
that a Japanese lawmaker has been arrested while parliament was sitting.
The prosecutors allege Mr Nakamura accepted a Y10m (Pounds 64,000) bribe on
January 13 1992 from Mr Shinji Kiyoyama, a former vice-president of the
construction company Kajima.
Yesterday's raids covered the homes of Mr Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of
Kajima, Mr Akira Miyazaki, the group's president, as well as Kajima's head
office. The home of Mr Tsuneo Aki, vice-president of Obayashi corporation,
one of Japan's five biggest construction groups, was also raided.
Rising long-term interest rates in Japan threaten to have an adverse impact
on the economy, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the country's central bank,
said yesterday, following the decision on Tuesday by the Industrial Bank of
Japan to raise its long-term prime-lending rate by 0.6 percentage points to
4.4 per cent. He said the Bank of Japan had no intention of intervening.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Japan's consumers spurn rice fit for an emperor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Emperor Akihito has consented to eat it. Mr Eijiro Hata, Japan's farm
minister, tried it yesterday and found it 'tasty in its own way'. But a
public suspicious of the foreign rice now on sale in the country prefers to
queue for up to two hours for the more expensive domestic equivalent.
As Mr Hata toured Tokyo stores to try to end panic buying of domestic rice,
the Imperial Household Agency said it had bought samples of US, Chinese and
Thai rice and the emperor had consented to eat the varieties mixed with
domestic rice.
Indeed, for general sale the government will require the blending of foreign
and domestic rice, so consumers will not be in a position to discriminate
against the imported crop. A first wave of buying began a few weeks ago
after reports that only 30 per cent of the rice marketed would be domestic.
The Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, a poor rice crop due to
typhoons and a cold summer have forced the government into covering the
shortage with imports.
Rumours of cigarette butts and rodents found in foreign rice exacerbated
fears about the imported product, already suspected in Japan of being unsafe
because of the pesticides and fungicides used. However, even the imported
rice for blending has been delayed in reaching national retailers, and a
second wave of buying has even spread to foreign rice.
Long queues now form in front of supermarkets on the day they receive their
rice supply from wholesalers. 'People are buying two to three times as much
as they usually do,' says Mr Yoshiro Takahashi of Rice Data Bank, which
provides information on rice distribution.
He says some wholesalers and distributors are hoarding rice in the hope that
the price will rise further.
However, many of the older generation insist they would rather eat bread and
noodles than imported rice. Some retailers say a number of consumers seem to
be put off from eating rice due to the confusion.
The Tokyo stock market has reacted to the current chaos in its own frenetic
way. Bakery and flour mill stocks have surged during the past week in
anticipation of a rise in bread consumption due to the rice shortage.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Riot police fired at demonstrators in the South African black 'homeland' of
Bophuthatswana for the second day running yesterday as a civil service
strike paralysed the government of increasingly embattled homeland leader
President Lucas Mangope. At least 32 people were wounded, witnesses said.
The homeland government said a police officer was killed.
President Mangope, who yesterday closed down the broadcasting service and
sacked all of its staff, rejected a request from the Independent Electoral
Commission to allow campaigning and polling for the April elections to take
place in the homeland. Bophuthatswana said earlier this week it would not
participate in these elections.
As teargas drifted toward the government offices from the nearby University
of Bophuthatswana, Finance Minister Ephraim Keikalame admitted candidly to
journalists: 'It is not possible to have an effective functioning government
under these circumstances.'
Almost the whole of the public service appeared to be on strike, including
essential services like hospitals, but telephones and electricity continued
to function. The capital's main hospital complex was deserted by staff, with
some patients lying unattended.
Outside the university, pol-ice armoured vehicles roared up and down
throughout the day, firing teargas cannisters and rubber bullets at students
barricading the entrance gate.
The rioting provoked a threat of direct South African intervention, with the
Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body overseeing government
in the run-up to elections, saying it would give President Mangope a week
'to change his attitude' after which steps would be taken to force
reincorporation.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Nigeria and Cameroon clash over oil-rich area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sabre-rattling and nationalist sentiment in Nigeria and Cameroon over a
disputed oil-rich peninsula that forms their shared border disguise vital
economic interests in the area as the governments of both countries face
strident opposition from democracy campaigners and dissenting minority
tribes.
Nigeria has almost 10 times the population of its neighbour and for years
the Bakassi peninsula has been mainly inhabited by Nigerians, many of them
migrant fishermen.
Although this area of south-eastern Nigeria produces 90 per cent of the
nation's foreign earnings, the dozens of minority tribes in the region have
been, on the government's own admission, neglected. Dispossession or
pollution of their farming and fishing areas have not been offset by a share
of the oil wealth, which has been invested in the north and west of Nigeria.
Large investment in exploration deep offshore could make the region even
wealthier in the next century. Bakassi also controls the seaway leading to
Calabar, the nearest big Nigerian port and the site of a new Export
Processing zone.
As the Nigerian government prepares for its delayed constitutional
conference, the eastern minorities are arguing for a better deal and more
autonomy. The military regime suspects that talk of autonomy could lead to
secession and the loss of massive oil wealth.
Cameroon's largest and most vocal dissident political grouping, the
opposition SDF party, has its stronghold near the border region. The mainly
Anglophone region produces most of Cameroon's wealth and is home to more
than 2m Nigerians.
Bakassi was part of the British-governed southern Cameroons from the First
World War until 1961 when the territory voted in a plebiscite to join the
newly independent Cameroon. In 1975 at the Marua treaty Nigeria's Gen Yakubu
Gowon re-affirmed Cameroon's claim to the area, allegedly to thank Cameroon
for providing access to re-capture Calabar during the Biafran war.
Nigeria's federal survey department published an atlas in 1978 signed by
then head of state Gen Olusegun Obasanjo which clearly shows Bakassi to be
in Cameroon.
Squabbles over the boundary in the swamps led to a clash of troops in 1981
then the row subsided. But Bakassi became an international dispute early
this year when Nigeria moved troops into the peninsula to counter alleged
raids by Cameroonian gendarmes against Nigerian fishermen. Last month,
Cameroon demanded the withdrawal of the troops from its territory and
complained to the United Nations Security Council.
After a skirmish on February 18 between rival military patrols in the
peninsula, with reports of light casualties on both sides, Cameroon asked
France for assistance under a bilateral defence pact. France sent two
helicopters and 15 troops to the capital Yaounde, a day's drive from the
border, at the same time as a senior diplomatic mission including President
Francois Mitterrand's special adviser on Africa, Mr Bruno Delaye, to mediate
between the two sides.
Both Britain and France are advising that the dispute be resolved in
bilateral talks, possibly with some assistance from the international court
at The Hague, and both believe that a debate before the UN Security Council,
of which France this month is chairman and Nigeria a temporary member, would
be acrimonious.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Overheating to dominate congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's parliament begins a two-week session today that is certain to be
dominated by concerns over the country's overheating economy and inflation
which exceeded 20 per cent in the big cities last year, writes Tony Walker.
China's Premier Li Peng, in his 'work report', will call for a slowing of
economic activity from 13 per cent last year to 9 per cent this year, but
economists say that such a sharp reduction is unrealistic.
Mr Li, who is beginning the second year of his second five-year term, will
emphasise the need for political and social stability. He can be expected to
give little quarter to international demands for greater political
liberalisation.
This National People's Congress, which will seek further to consolidate
China's economic reforms, is being held in the shadow of the continuing row
with Britain over Hong Kong and against a background of international
concern about China's human rights behaviour. Mr Li will assail Britain over
the breakdown of talks on Hong Kong's future, saying that London should
assume 'full responsibility'.
The NPC will deal with a modest legislative programme in contrast to last
year.

FT  10 MAR 94 / HK reform bill faces tough debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The second and final stage of governor Chris Patten's democratic reforms for
Hong Kong, containing many of the more controversial elements that failed to
win Beijing's approval after 17 rounds of negotiations, was introduced into
the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) yesterday.
The bill which, among other proposals, gives the colony's 2.7m-strong
workforce a second vote through the creation of nine new functional
constituencies (industry-based groupings) replacing corporate votes with
votes cast by individual employees, is expected to have a stormy ride
through LegCo even in the absence of a further outburst from China.
While Beijing itself has already made clear that it views the move as a
unilateral step by Britain and therefore one which brings to an end
co-operation between the two over the future of Hong Kong, and has further
said it will unwind representative bodies on resuming sovereignty, LegCo
members are also lining up for battle. Some believe the proposals do not go
far enough; others will push for a watered down version.
However, with the bill designed to prepare the way for elections this year,
there will also be pressure to move swiftly. Legislation would need to be
enacted before LegCo's summer recess in July to allow the administration to
put in place the practical preparations for the elections, the government
said.
The government believes the proposals will lead to fair and open elections,
and that broadening the franchise will strengthen the credibility of the
functional constituency system.
However, Mr CM Leung, deputy secretary for constitutional affairs, conceded
it was still in a state of evolution. 'The system is not perfect,' he said.
If the bill is passed, all adults aged 18 or above and registered in the
electoral roll will be able to cast votes in up to two categories: their
geographical constituency and their functional constituency. Non-working
groups such as housewives will be restricted to a single vote.
In addition to introducing nine new functional constituencies, four existing
professional groups will be expanded. By scrapping corporate voting -
whereby one authorised person casts votes on behalf of his company - the
government claims it will rid the colony of the problem of multiple voting,
which occurs when one director controls a number of companies and hence a
number of votes.
The first-past-the-post voting system will be adopted for all bar three
functional constituencies, where the preferential elimination system will be
retained in view of their smaller franchises.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Dalai Lama attacks Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dalai Lama yesterday attacked China for paying 'lip service' to his
attempts to negotiate on the future of Tibet and said Tibetans might have to
adopt a new approach to their freedom struggle.
The exiled leader's statement, issued from his home in Dharamsala, India, is
likely to increase tension during this week's visit to Beijing by Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state.
Tibet is among the human rights issues on which the US is demanding progress
before China's most-favoured nation (MFN) trading status is renewed this
year.
The Dalai Lama said he had 'left no stone unturned' in seeking an agreement
on the basis of a statement in 1979 by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's leader,
that 'except for independence of Tibet, all other questions can be
negotiated'. But Beijing had repeatedly rejected his overtures.
He said: 'I must now recognise that my approach has failed to produce any
progress either for substantive negotiations or in contributing to the
overall improvement of the situation in Tibet.'
The Dalai Lama acknowledged that his failure to press for complete
independence had disappointed many Tibetans.
He said conditions in Tibet had worsened dramatically with increased
suppression and marginalisation of Tibetans and the destruction of culture
and the environment.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Christopher's mission imperfect: A look at a difficult visit
to Beijing by the US secretary of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the fragile state of Sino-US relations and the high stakes involved
that Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, arrives in Beijing
tomorrow just a day after China's annual parliamentary session convenes.
Normally, foreign envoys would be discouraged from visiting during this
two-week period in early spring when 3,000 delegates to China's parliament
gather in the Great Hall of the People, but Mr Christopher's is no ordinary
mission.
The US official, who has met his counterpart, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen,
three times since last year will try to engage the Chinese further on a
range of issues, while at the same time warning them of the seriousness of
the human rights issue.
Judging by the recent spate of arrests of prominent Chinese dissidents, Mr
Christopher faces significant difficulties in his efforts to persuade his
hosts that such persistent harassment threatens renewal of China's
preferential trading status in the US.
More to the point, argument over human rights risks undermining the Clinton
administration's attempts to broaden its links with Beijing that followed a
decision last September to halt the 'downward spiral' in relations.
Washington's Pacific strategy, based on enhancing the role of the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation forum with China as a key partner, may also be
jeopardised.
Not least of the regional issues in which China and the US have a vital
interest is that of trying to ensure that the simmering argument over North
Korea's nuclear ambitions does not boil over in a way that might destabilise
the Korean peninsula.
A rupture over human rights could also threaten a booming commercial
relationship that saw two-way trade exceed Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27.3bn) last
year, with the balance heavily in China's favour. The World Bank estimates
that 96 per cent of China's exports to the US are covered by preferential
tariffs.
Mr Christopher was understandably exasperated in remarks to reporters in
Canberra this week when he observed that China was 'going in the wrong
direction' on human rights. Indeed, he was reported to have even canvassed
the possibility of abandoning his Beijing visit in protest at the recent
arrests.
Chinese officials remain confident, however, that in the end Mr Clinton will
feel obliged to renew China's most favoured nation trading status. This
calculation - American officials worry about China under-estimating the
strength of US sentiment on human rights - may in part explain Beijing's
playing 'hardball' on the eve of the visit.
'The Clinton administration will renew China's MFN status because of the
pressure of different groups in the US who have a vested interest in China's
enormous market,' said a senior Chinese adviser on US policy. 'However, from
now until June, there will be a process of hard barg-aining.'
A possible complication for Mr Christopher and Chinese leaders during their
talks in the next few days is that, with parliament in session, no official
will want to be seen adopting a quiescent attitude in what are certain to be
difficult discussions. US officials should steel themselves for some sharp
exchanges.
The US has prepared carefully for the Christopher mission with several
visits recently to Beijing by Mr John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of
state for human rights. He spelled out American requirements for MFN renewal
to meet the criteria of 'overall significant improvement' laid down by Mr
Clinton.
These include access to prisons for the International Committee of the Red
Cross, an end to prison-made exports to the US, the further release of
dissidents, human rights improvements in Tibet and steps toward making it
easier for Chinese to emigrate.
The US could hardly have done more to improve relations since its decision
last September to 'engage' China. Apart from Mr Clinton's meetings in
Seattle with President Jiang Zemin in November, a succession of senior
administration officials have passed through Beijing, including Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Mr Charles Freeman, an assistant
secretary of defence.
Indeed, defence co-operation is high on the agenda for Mr Christopher's
visit. The secretary's party includes Mr Frank Wisner, undersecretary of
defence for policy, who is scheduled to stay on in Beijing next week to
discuss ways in which defence relations may be upgraded.
Among various options being considered are expanding co-operation in
peacekeeping and disaster relief operations in the Asian region, and the
establishment of a Joint Commission of Defence Conversion to facilitate
exchanges on converting military factories to civilian use.
This will be the highest level visit by a US defence official since the
Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.
All this is a long way from the angry exchanges that followed Washington's
decision last August to impose sanctions on the transfer of high-technology
items to China in retaliation for the export of Chinese components to
Pakistan for the M-11 missile.
China denied that it had contravened guidelines of the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTRC). The episode marked something of a nadir in Sino-US
relations. Mr Christopher will be anxious to avoid another downward spiral,
but equally the US will want to see some early dividends, especially on
human rights, from its policy of constructive engagement.

The Slovak president yesterday accused Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar of
corruption in a speech marking a final break between Slovakia's two top
officials and a new push to end its political paralysis. President Michal
Kovac stopped short of asking for the resignation of the populist prime
minister, who has led Slovakia since it gained independence in the break-up
of Czechslovakia 15 months ago. But deputies later voted for Mr Meciar to
face a no-confidence motion. Mr Kovac, clearly angry stunned lawmakers by
claiming Mr Meciar had told him he wanted a political ally in control of
privatising the economy so he could wring money out of it for his political
party.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last year registered
about a four-fold increase in disbursements of loans and equity investments
to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Its disbursements increased
to Ecu435m (Pounds 329m) last year from Ecu122m in 1992, with signed loan
and equity commitments rising to Ecu1.79bn during 1993 from Ecu946m during
1992. The bank also registered a small net profit of Ecu4m in 1993, after a
loss of Ecu6m in 1992. The bank was heavily criticised last year for
over-spending in administrative and refurbishment outlays. This provoked a
crisis which led to the resignation of Mr Jacques Attali and his replacement
by Mr Jacques de Larosiere. The bank said it had taken action to lower
operating costs to Ecu137m, 8 per cent below budgeted levels.

The Bundesbank yesterday sanctioned another modest decline in the repo rate,
signalling that the trend towards cheaper credit in Germany was still
intact. The Bundesbank allowed its key securities repurchase rate to fall to
5.94 per cent, from 5.97 per cent last week. Rates in Belgium edged lower
soon after the German move, with the Belgian National Bank cutting its
central rate to 6.15 per cent from 6.25 per cent. The Bundesbank's repo rate
was cut to 5.97 per cent last week after the central bank had held it steady
at 6 per cent since early December last year. Financial markets had been
hoping for a slightly steeper cut in the repo rate, to as low as 5.90 per
cent, and German stock and bond prices initially eased on the news. But
money market dealers said the small rate cut had reassured the market the
Bundesbank would carry on slowly reducing the cost of borrowing.

MEPs yesterday voted to prevent Britain from avoiding restrictions on the
use of child labour that other European Union members have agreed to.
Britain had sought four years' grace before introducing limits on working
hours and mandatory rest periods for young children and adolescents aged 16
to 18. The British Labour party employment spokesman in the European
Parliament, Steven Hughes, had compiled statistics showing that 39
work-related deaths in Britain since 1990 involved 16-19 year olds. He said
there were indications the European Commission would support parliament's
move to end the British opt-out for working children but not for
adolescents. If the Commission supports the assembly's move, then the
Council of Ministers can only override this by a unanimous vote.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Parliament yesterday rejected proposals to tighten
anti-pollution regulations against car manufacturers from 1996. MEPs threw
out the proposals after strong opposition from the European Commission and
the auto industry which argued it threatened jobs and investment. The vote
opens the way for passage of existing proposals gradually to limit car
emissions through legislation due to come into force in 1996. The car
industry has been working toward a set goal of lower emissions, but became
alarmed after the parliament's environment committee introduced a raft of
amendments for tougher standards and a faster timetable. The amendments also
demanded a 50 per cent increase in air quality standards, as well as new tax
incentives for clean cars and a carbon tax to limit fuel consumption. The
second reading vote at the Strasbourg parliament was eagerly awaited because
it provided a test of the Maastricht treaty's new clauses on co-decision. If
the amendment had secured the 260 votes necessary for passage, it would have
gone back to the Council of Ministers which would have been forced to broker
a compromise or face a showdown with a newly assertive parliament.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday claimed he was being
subjected to an 'unprecedented campaign of political aggression', reacting
to reports his Fininvest empire was being scrutinised by Milan magistrates.
Mr Berlusconi accused the magistrates of permitting a rumour campaign
suggesting illicit payments had been made by members of Fininvest. For the
past 48 hours the Italian press has been carrying a series of leaks, clearly
coming from the magistrates, suggesting arrests of at least five Fininvest
officials are imminent. The reports have been linked to investigations into
illicit payments allegedly made in connection with the purchase of players
by Mr Berlusconi's AC Milan football club. Mr Berlusconi's attack underlined
the increasingly politicised investigations of the magistrates. It also
coincides with a rise in the temperature of the poll campaign, which Mr
Berlusconi is hoping to win with the Forza Italia movement.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A possible breakthrough in the dispute between Greece and Macedonia emerged
last night before both sides meet under UN auspices in Geneva today. If
resolved, it could help shore up a fragile stability in the southern
Balkans.
Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US secretary of state and UN mediator in former
Yugoslavia, will discuss the draft accord with Greek foreign minister
Carolos Papoulias and Mr Stevo Crvenkovski, his Macedonian counterpart.
Under the proposed agreement, Macedonia would immediately alter its flag
which carries a starburst symbol linked with the ancient Greek kings of
Macedon. In return, Greece would drop its veto on Macedonian membership of
the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and participation in
the European Union's aid programme for eastern Europe.
Greek officials have indicated the embargo would be lifted as soon as
Macedonia put another symbol on its flag and gave assurances the
constitutional issue would be addressed.
The possibility of movement follows this week's decision by the EU and the
Commission to soft-pedal on earlier threats of legal action over Greece's
trade embargo, and to acknowledge there is a 'political' element to the
Macedonia dispute. In Strasbourg, Mr Papoulias said the EU's stance had
given Athens room for manoeuvre.
Today's talks coincide with cabinet meetings in Britain and Canada to decide
how many troops, pending support from other countries, they will send to
Bosnia to shore up the ceasefire. Lieutenant General Jean Marcotte, the UN's
military spokesman in Zagreb, Croatia, said yesterday that any delay in
sending troops 'would place the peace process in a critical situation'.
Other countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, and particularly Turkey
which has 1,000 troops on standby, have offered reinforcements. But Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has ruled against sending
troops from neighbouring countries.
The US, which has refused to send ground forces to Bosnia until a full peace
agreement is signed, was yesterday understood to be considering boosting its
force in Macedonia from 300 to 700. This would allow a 400-strong Nordic
force stationed in Macedonia to be sent to Bosnia.
France will offer more troops on a 'roll-over' basis, sending in forces
earlier to overlap with those on the ground. The Nordic countries said they
were prepared to re-deploy troops from Croatia.
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said
yesterday that some 50,000 western troops, half of them American, would be
needed to oversee any Bosnian peace agreement, Reuter reports from
Washington. He was challenging earlier reports that a smaller force of
20,000-30,000 troops, perhaps a third of them American, could monitor any
final peace deal.

FT  10 MAR 94 / France is in a budgetary bind, says the OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French economy will grow by 1 per cent this year, less than the 1.4 per
cent forecast by the Balladur government which may thus have difficulty
hitting its deficit reduction target, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development warns in a report today.
The OECD says France needs to cut its interest rates further, and accepts
that it wants to do this only in conjunction with Germany, and assumes that
this will be possible.
But it cautions that 'if German interest rates fell by less than projected,
the French authorities would have to consider how to continue their policy
of gradual interest rate reductions while maintaining their stable currency
strategy'. It suggests that with 'no room for fiscal manoeuvre left' to
boost the economy through the budget, a further easing of monetary policy
would 'be the only way to support demand'.
While acknowledging the pick-up in consumption in the third quarter of last
year, the Paris-based organisation says the signs are 'the (economic)
decline has halted, rather than that a clear-cut recovery is under way'.
French government economists yesterday attributed the OECD's caution to the
fact that it, like every other forecaster, failed to predict the 1992-93
recession, and to the fact that its report does not take into account the
continued improvement in the last three months of 1993. This showed a 0.2
per cent rise in output, with an automatic 'carry-over' effect contributing
0.3-0.4 per cent to this year's growth.
Highlighting France's budgetary bind, the OECD suggests that the government
may be planning to restrain public spending too much for the short-term
health of the economy, but too little to fulfil the longer-term fiscal goals
set out in the Maastricht treaty for monetary union.
This discrepancy arises out of the fact that the government plans to bring
down its central budget deficit from FFr317bn (Pounds 36.31bn) last year to
FFr300bn in 1994, but has taken few measures to contain local authorities'
spending and to cut back social welfare spending. France aims to meet the
Maastricht goal of bringing overall public borrowings/deficits to 3 per cent
or less by 1997. But the ratio this year for France, the OECD predicts, will
be nearer 5.75 per cent of gross national output in 1994, rather than the
5.1 per cent government target.
The OECD criticises the tax system, despite recent reforms, as having too
narrow a base, too complex a structure and too steep a progression.
But the OECD endorses the government's moves to shift more of the cost of
the French welfare state off the backs of companies and their employees and
on to the state budget. However, it says the government may have to go
further than it did in 1993 in cutting pension benefits and much further
than it has in containing the cost of French healthcare.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Paris to privatise Bull and AGF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday confirmed that it plans to privatise
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance group, and Groupe Bull,
the troubled computer company, after the forthcoming sale of Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurer.
However Renault, the motor group, was omitted from the latest privatisation
list, published yesterday. Its absence appeared to confirm reports that Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, favoured postponing its sale until
after next spring's presidential elections.
Renault's omission fuelled speculation about a rift between Mr Balladur and
Mr Gerard Longuet, his industry minister. Mr Longuet said in an interview in
Tuesday's edition of Ouest France, a leading regional newspaper, that he
hoped the group would be sold 'as quickly as possible'.
However, Mr Balladur and Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior minister,
are believed to have advocated delay on the grounds that the privatisation
could be politically sensitive at a time of rising unemployment and social
instability, given Renault's status as an historic battleground for French
workers' rights.
The delay also reflects concern about the condition of the French stock
market, which has been volatile in recent weeks. 'French equities are very
jittery,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon.
'The French must be worried about the risk of swamping the market with yet
more equity.'
Moreover, the success of the first phase of the privatisation drive has
given Mr Balladur some flexibility over the timing of future issues. His
government originally budgeted to raise FFr55bn (Pounds 6.3bn) from its 1994
share issues. It has already yielded FFr33bn from last month's sale of the
Elf-Aquitaine oil group, with another FFr28bn expected from the UAP issue.
This means that the government will beat this year's financial target even
before selling its AGF stake, which should be worth FFr15bn. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister, yesterday said the proceeds of the AGF issue
were needed to recapitalise a number of state-controlled companies.
The value of the Bull privatisation is more difficult to assess given that
it is likely to be phased into several stages, including a small public
offer and the sale of minority stakes to industrial partners.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Economic Watch: Oil demand revised upwards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Energy Agency forecast for oil demand in OECD countries in
the first quarter of 1994 has been revised upwards by 0.1m barrels a day, to
40.3m. European demand is expected to be temporarily subdued as a result of
very mild weather, but is projected to rise modestly in 1994, to 13.7m b/d,
from 13.6m in 1993. The IEA revised upwards European demand in the fourth
quarter of 1993 by 0.2m b/d to 14m b/d, but the agency said this reflected
an increase in stocks, rather than any underlying increase in oil
consumption. Further stockbuilding in Europe during January has left stock
levels 'above normal', the IEA said. Outside the OECD, demand in the former
Soviet Union is expected to decline by 0.6m bpd in 1994, from 5.6m bpd in
1993.
The Hamburg-based HWWA economic research institute has forecast real growth
of 5 per cent in German exports in 1994, after a 6 per cent fall in 1993.
East German exports should also grow, it said.
Western German retail trading sales fell a real 2 per cent in January from a
year earlier, and stagnated in nominal terms. Retail sales in January were
down an average 37 per cent from December.
Hungary's unemployment rate fell to 12.6 per cent in February from 12.8 per
cent in January, with the number of registered unemployed falling by 11,000,
to 630,600.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Voting row goes to heart of EU's fault lines: How a dispute
among the 12 has put the prospects for the 16 in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain and Spain will come under intense pressure from their European
partners to settle the EU power-sharing dispute which threatens to prevent
four new members - Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway - entering the Union.
Britain in particular, has been identified as the villain in sabotaging
prospects for the wider Europe it says it wants.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, mainly blamed the UK when the
enlargement negotiations broke up in rancour late Tuesday night, to resume
in Brussels next Tuesday.
London and Madrid, with lukewarm support from the Italians, insist on
keeping the weighted voting rules of the 12 - where two large and one small
countries combining 23 out of 76 votes can block measures - for a Union of
16. Their nine partners want to move the threshold to 27 out of 90 votes,
keeping the same, roughly 30 per cent proportion for the 'blocking
minority', after the four newcomers arrive.
'The Nine won't blink on the 27 votes,' Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch minister
for Europe warned early yesterday.
British officials maintain that only the Benelux countries and possibly
France firmly oppose the UK and Spain, with a large pool in between for both
sides to fish in before next Tuesday. The known evidence from what has
nevertheless been a row behind closed doors suggests they are wrong.
First, the power-sharing issue goes to the heart of the divisions in the
Union which the Maastricht treaty failed to close: between North and South,
between big and small member states, between the sovereignty-conscious who
prefer inter-governmental co-operation, and federalists who want to tighten
European integration and make decisions at EU level easier.
But more immediately, countries like Germany and Holland - both with greater
right to complain about under-representation in the Council than the UK or
Spain - feel certain that the European Parliament will not ratify the
accession treaty if EU law-making is made more difficult by a shrinking
minority.
Parliament formally has to decide whether to go ahead today. This might be
stretched to next week. Much beyond that, however, and the January 1995
enlargement target could be lost, along with momentum in the applicant
countries which still have to convince their voters to endorse entry.
Although nobody disputes that the UK and Spain can block the decision, there
is a growing feeling in Brussels that Britain has misread the situation -
unless it is putting down markers now for the 1996 constitutional review to
which the 12 heads of government (including Mr Major and Mr Felipe Gonzalez)
in June 1992 remitted the votes issue.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has suggested moving to 27 votes
for the moment, and for the 12 leaders to set up a committee to study vote
distribution ahead of 1996, specifically taking into account British,
Spanish, Italian, and also German concerns.
This looks like the only sort of framework which can resolve the dispute and
deliver a Europe of 16 next year - and the British and Spanish governments
can expect to be told so in no uncertain terms in the few days left.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Norway unflustered by collapse of talks

<TEXT>
Norway yesterday appeared unflustered by the hiatus in its fraught
negotiations on terms for entry to the European Union as the government
presented the wrangles within the EU on the talks as evidence that it was
driving a good deal for Oslo, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm.
Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the Norwegian fisheries minister - given a virtual veto
on the country's entry terms by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland - said
he would recommend acceptance of a proposed deal blocked only by Spain when
the talks stalled in Brussels. 'If Spain accepts the proposed solution on
fish already accepted by the 11 other EU members and Norway, I will say yes
to membership and recommend others to do the same,' said Mr Olsen formerly a
staunch opponent of Norwegian entry to the union.
In Stockholm, Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said he was not
concerned by the delay in Brussels. 'This is not a breakdown in
negotiations, but a one week delay. There is no reason to believe Sweden's
entry will be delayed,' he said.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Brussels to probe aid for airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is to investigate the state aid which Portugal and
Greecehave offered to their national airlines, TAP-Air Portugal and Olympic
Airways.
The investigation is likely to fuel the long-running row between member
states over the Commission's efforts to curtail state aid to airlines - a
dispute that seems likely to gather pace with the announcement of a new
state package for Air France in Paris this week.
The Commission's investigation into TAP follows the Portuguese government's
approval two months ago of a Es180bn (Pounds 687m) aid package for the
airline, designed to bail out the loss-making group as part of a broader
restructuring programme.
This aid, which would absorb TAP's Es124,4 debts, will be allocated in four
tranches over the next four years, according to the plans submitted to the
Commission by the Portuguese government.
At the same time the Commission will examine the Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.51bn) of
state aid that the Greek government has offered to Olympic Airways. This aid
is to be split into two parts, with Ecu1.1bn designated to absorb Olympic's
previous debts and Ecu96m earmarked for future capital projects.
Commission officials said yesterday the investigations into state aid for
airlines were now almost standard policy, given the increasingly tough line
that the Commission has taken in recent years towards state subsidies in
European industry.
Last December the Commission approved IPounds 175m (Pounds 168m) aid for
Irish carrier Aer Lingus after a similar investigation, although it insisted
the aid could only be used to restore the company to financial viability and
could not be used to distort the market.
A more controversial investigation into the FFr1.5bn (Pounds 174m) of aid
for Air France is under way, with results expected in several months.
The question at stake will be whether the Greek and Portuguese aid
represents a 'one-off' attempt to make the airlines viable for future
competition, Commission officials said. Although they insisted that
'one-off' aid was still permissible, under Commission rules, aid that could
seriously distort the market would not be permitted.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Catalonia sees war of words as dangerous fantasy: A look at
the growing row over the Catalan language law which has been referred to
Spain's highest court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Scoop, the British writer Evelyn Waugh's seminal satire on journalistic
jaunts, a celebrated war correspondent sent to cover a revolution in a
Balkans capital oversleeps in his train carriage, wakes up in the wrong
city, blithely rattles off dispatches about flaming churches and dead
children, and succeeds in creating financial panic, famine and a revolution
on his hotel doorstep.
Waugh's fable resurfaced two weeks ago in an editorial on the Catalan
language question in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia. Mr Jordi Pujol,
president of Catalonia's autonomous government, the Generalitat, since 1980,
has since seized the story to explain in subsequent press conferences that
the supposed row is a fantasy which could turn dangerous.
At issue is a Catalan language law, unanimously passed by Catalonia's
parliament 11 years ago in one of Mr Pujol's earliest legislative
initiatives, that has been referred by the Supreme Court in Madrid to the
Constitutional Court, an even higher Madrid-based judicial body whose 12
members are the watchdogs of civic rights and duties.
The Constitutional Court has to decide whether the language law infringes
the rights of Spanish speakers in Catalonia by forcing them to learn
Catalan, a language that the post-Franco constitution asserts is co-official
with Spanish in the area. It is expected to spend months pondering over its
ruling. In Mr Pujol's view there is no issue and no row - only interested
parties who seek to rock Catalonia's calm.
The Scoop-like correspondent creating the storm is a well-known extreme
right-winger in Barcelona and a lawyer, Mr Esteban Gomez Rovira, aided and
abetted by the conservative Madrid newspaper ABC.
Mr Gomez Rovira has been fighting legal battles to curb the growing use of
Catalan in the area's schools ever since the language law was enacted. In
1985 and 1987 he survived bomb attacks from Catalan extremists. His latest
assault, now before the Constitutional Court, follows what he terms 'a turn
of the screw by the Generalitat'. The twist by Mr Pujol's government, which
has so far gained the backing of the judiciary for its educational
initiatives, has been its insistence on Catalan-only schooling for children
up to the age of seven under a new policy called 'linguistic immersion'.
Mr Gomez Rovira sees the development as one step further in the creation of
a monolingual culture that will destroy 'the unity of Spain'.
ABC has given the lawyer a platform for his views ('it has made all the
difference', he says).
The newspaper claims that Mr Pujol is seeking to stamp out Spanish just as
Francoism sought to eradicate the language of Catalonia.
Surveys conducted by the Generalitat, and a succession of views in Barcelona
from a cross-section of native Catalans and of immigrants to the area,
suggest a very different picture to the one painted by ABC. The vast
majority are functionally bilingual; they do not question the Generalitat's
weighting towards Catalan and they are not 'unlearning' their Spanish.
Unlike other minority languages that have become nationalist emblems,
Catalan is a romance language that is easy to learn and, more importantly,
it is very much a living language that carries social prestige.
Immigrants from southern Spain, who swelled Barcelona dormitory towns such
as Santa Coloma from 12,000 in the 1950s to 140,000 today, wanted to learn
the language of the foreman on the building site and in the workshop.
Mr Pujol's education department claims that over the past five years the
percentage of Catalonia's 6m inhabitants that does not understand Catalan
has been reduced from 9.4 per cent to 6.2 per cent; nearly 94 per cent
understand Catalan, 68 per cent can speak and read it and 40 per cent can
write it.
The department's officials say that far from discriminating against
immigrants, the 'linguistic immersion' policy wants to ensure that children
from Spanish-speaking homes will have an equal opportunity in a schooling
system where more than half the subjects are taught in Catalan.
To date, less than 500 parents have backed Mr Gomez Rovira's campaign to
demand Spanish-language schooling with Catalan as an optional subject.
Mr Pujol believes that the cornerstone of continued calm and consensus in
Catalonia is the maintenance of the present impulse towards cementing a
bilingual society.
He fears that the Constitutional Court might, like Mr Gomez Rovira and the
Scoop journalist, wake up at the wrong station, and create an artificial
conflict by upholding a dual schooling system that would prove dangerously
divisive.

FT  10 MAR 94 / A tale of paper cod and accelerated cohesion fish: The Greek
handling of the talks unravelled the EU's Byzantine solution to the fishing
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute over the conduct of the talks, rather than the content of the
negotiations, appears to have stood in the way of the European Union
clinching entry terms with Norway late on Tuesday night, when ministerial
negotiations in Brussels on EU enlargement broke up in disarray
Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, walked out of the
negotiations for some two hours, irritated by the way the Greek presidency
of the EU presented Spain with what he evidently saw as a 'take it or leave
it' offer on access to Norwegian fish, without allowing time for the Spanish
to examine the details.
Spanish officials at the meeting nevertheless confirmed that they were
prepared to give serious consideration to the content of the offer.
The main obstacle to concluding terms with Norway is Spanish insistence that
it get back the 7,000 tonnes of cod its fishing fleet used to catch in
Norwegian waters before it was barred in 1981.
Madrid equally wants the cod Norway ceded to the EU as part of this year's
European Economic Area (EEA) free trade zone treaty 'consolidated' as part
of a permanent quota. This amounts to 7,250 tonnes this year, rising to
11,000 tonnes in 1997, with the so-called 'cohesion' or poor countries,
Spain and Portugal, getting 45 per cent each, and Greece and Ireland
splitting the rest.
But for over a year Oslo has unflinchingly refused to give up a single extra
fish. 'I will stand tall and firm and say No,' Mr Jan Henry Olsen, Norway's
fisheries minister, said on Tuesday, as Spain reiterated its threat to veto
Norwegian entry unless he budged.
The European Commission's alchemists, however, were busy working up a
seemingly impossible formula to save the face of both Madrid and Oslo. Its
main elements are:
To bring forward the 11,000 tonnes quota for 1997 to this year (these are
known as 'accelerated cohesion fish').
Under the EEA, the Union also gets 2.9 per cent of the total Norwegian
waters cod quota, or about 40,000 tonnes this year. But the cod stock is
rising because of careful Norwegian fisheries management, promising a higher
tonnage for the EU in coming years. Brussels wants to satisfy Spain's
demands by giving it these additional tonnes (known as 'paper fish', because
at the moment they are only there on paper).
Anticipating that Spain will not be satisfied, the Commission has also
looked at 'other people's fish'. Brussels suggests the Union buys a portion
of Russia's cod quota in Norwegian waters, allocate it to Spain, and pass
the bill through Oslo's contribution to the EU budget.
Norwegian officials, with whom this formula had to be worked out, were
obviously familiar with the details of this package; Spanish officials,
equally obviously, were not. When Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European
affairs minister chairing the EU Council of Ministers, presented Spain with
what it regarded as a fait accompli, Mr Solana took it as an affront and
left for his embassy.
Spanish officials say they need time to study the implications, but concede
that the Commission formula could turn dross, or at least cod, into gold.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Barclays considers default provisions to limit profit swings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays, the largest UK bank, is working on plans to even out cyclical
swings in its profits by making a small provision for default each time it
lends money. It hopes this will prevent large rises in loan provisions
during recessions.
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, is backing the initiative
although it was discussed before he took up his post full-time in January.
Barclays announces its 1993 profits today, after a Pounds 242m loss in 1992.
Banks suffered from an unprecedented swing in their profits in the five
years from 1987 because they boosted earnings by increasing loans rapidly in
the late 1980s. They were then hit by a wave of bad debt provisions in the
recession.
Banks carry general provisions against losses they expect from loans which
appear to be sound, but Barclays wants to make this more exact. It would
book a small loss against each loan, set according to the chance of it not
being repaid. The bank is trying to analyse the risks over full economic
cycles of particular types of lending, such as small corporate loans or
those to particular industries. Mr Taylor is thought to be keen to implement
the new approach next year.
Barclays' directors believe that by making loans carry a small provision
based on risk, they could discourage branch managers both from lending too
much during economic booms and refusing loans during recession.
However, the initiative could be hard to implement because of the difficulty
of assessing risk accurately. The move could also be opposed by bank
auditors, who might regard it as an attempt to smooth profits by mis-stating
earnings.
The bank could also increase its tax liability by making general provisions.
Specific provisions against loans clearly in danger of default are tax
deductible, but general provisions against expected loss are not.
Barclays signalled a move towards evening out volatility in profits when it
increased its general provisions by Pounds 118m in the first half of 1993.
It holds general provisions worth about 0.6 per cent of its loans and
advances.
Mr Taylor is thought to be keen to implement the idea in full. If Barclays
cannot gain approval from auditors, it might bring in the change internally
in separate management accounts.

FT  10 MAR 94 / IRA attack shatters peace hopes: Mortars fired on Heathrow
as MPs debate terror law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JIMMY BURNS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA last night renewed its mainland terrorist campaign with a mortar
attack on Heathrow airport, shattering lingering hopes of an early peace
settlement in Ulster.
The provocative and potentially devastating attack, in which four mortar
bombs were fired from a hotel car park towards the airport's northern
runway, came as the Commons debated renewal of legislation to combat IRA
violence. MPs also voted to set up a new cross-party committee on Northern
Ireland issues.
The attack - in which no-one was injured - came on the eve of the latest
meeting in London of Irish and British ministers to prepare a blueprint for
a political settlement in the province.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is likely to come under pressure in the
Commons today to make clear that the government's patience has run out in
waiting for a response from the republican movement to the Downing Street
declaration. MPs will demand that the government now enforces a new security
crackdown.
Last night's attack, which police said was accompanied with a recognised IRA
warning, caused widespread disruption at Heathrow, which is the world's
busiest international airport.
The four mortars, fired from beyond the airport perimeter, failed to
detonate, but two landed on the airport's northern runway. Aircraft
continued to take off from the runway for about 30 minutes after the attack
until it was closed by police.
Six-foot long tubes full of high explosives were used to fire the devices in
the attack about 400 yards from the runway. The devices were fired from a
Nissan Micra car just before 6pm from the Excelsior Hotel car park.
The attack, announced to the Commons by Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, provided a powerful reminder of the failure of last December's
Anglo-Irish declaration to halt the IRA's terrorism campaign, and again
demonstrated its ability to strike high-security targets.
London and Dublin have been hoping that Sinn Fein might persuade the IRA to
end its campaign of violence and enter the peace process.
But with its hopes apparently rebuffed, both governments will today make
clear their determination to press on with talks aimed at a political
settlement. Downing Street said last night that the declaration and the
principles underlying it remained intact.
The attack, the first time the IRA has used mortars in mainland Britain
since its attempt to bomb 10 Downing Street in 1991, coincided with the
House of Commons debate on the annual renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism
Act.
Mr Howard said he was 'deeply concerned' at what had obviously been a very
serious attack. He had called for a detailed report on the incident and
would see what lessons could be learnt.
As the Commons backed the renewal of the act by a margin of 86, Mr Howard
told MPs: 'I do not know whether that incident is supposed to send some
message to the House as we conclude our debate on these matters.'
He added: 'If it is, I know that there is only one conclusion that this
House can responsibly take. We know in unequivocal terms that the
Association of Chief Police Officers considers this act in its present form
to be essential in the fight against terrorism'. Earlier, an attempt by the
Labour party to establish a new cross-party consensus on the retention of
the anti-terrorism legislation ended in acrimony and recriminination in the
Commons.
Labour MPs were angered by Mr Howard's rejection of opposition calls for an
inquiry by a senior judge into the provisions permitting terrorist suspects
to be detained for questioning for up to seven days, and for those from
Northern Ireland to be excluded from mainland Britain.
Heathrow is an important economic target. In addition to handling more than
42m passengers a year, it employs 50,000 people - 1,400 of them security
staff - and supports an estimated 20,000 local jobs.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Air France plan likely to provoke EU row: French government
agrees fresh capital for state-owned airline to aid restructuring moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is set to provoke a head-on confrontation with the
Brussels authorities and European countries, including Britain, by agreeing
to inject up to FFr20bn (Pounds 2.31bn) in Air France, the troubled French
national airline.
The government said yesterday it would approve a significant
recapitalisation for Air France if the state-owned airline's 42,000
employees and their unions approved a restructuring plan drawn up by Mr
Christian Blanc, the airline's new chairman.
The government refused to give details of the recapitalisation and
restructuring programme which the airline will unveil today. But it said Air
France had asked for 'a very large sum'.
French government officials would not confirm press reports that the airline
was seeking a FFr20bn capital injection. 'In the current state of things I
cannot confirm this figure. I simply want to tell you that the state has
decided to do its duty by Air France,' a spokesman said.
The EU has recently recommended an end to all state aid for European
airlines, but has agreed to allow financially strapped national carriers to
receive one last package of state support as long as they launch a thorough
restructuring programme.
But the size of the Air France plan is expected to set off a storm in
Brussels and other European capitals.
The UK government, along with British Airways and British Midland Airways,
has been stepping up its campaign against state subsidised European national
carriers, claiming that state aid was distorting competition in the
liberalised single European aviation market.
Air France, which lost FFr7.5bn last year and has debts of FFr37bn, has been
struggling to put together a restructuring programme to restore the airline
to a competitive footing and return it to profit.
An earlier restructuring programme involving 4,000 job cuts was rejected by
unions and led to the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali as Air France
chairman, after the government refused to back his strategy.
The latest attempt is not expected to involve compulsory redundancies, but
significant internal organisational changes. Both the French government and
the airline's new management have been at pains to avoid another politically
damaging confrontation with the airline's workforce and unions.
Mr Blanc's proposals are also expected to include eventual employee share
ownership in exchange for wage cuts and other productivity improvements.
The government indicated yesterday it would inject funds into the airline in
tranches.
The first would follow approval by the unions of the restructuring plan, and
subsequent tranches would be subject to the implementation of the programme.
Air France, which has lost money since 1989, has already received state aid
totalling FFr5.84bn in 1991 and 1992. The EU is currently investigating
another FFr1.5bn aid package made last year.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Ban on use of BT lines for TV to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has ruled out any early lifting of the ban on British
Telecommunications using its network to carry television broadcasts, despite
BT claims that Britain risks losing out to international competitors in the
information revolution.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the telecommunications minister, has written to the
Cable Television Association, which represents the cable companies building
combined phone and television networks in urban areas, to reaffirm the
government's commitment to maintaining the restrictions on BT.
He said the government would stick to the terms of the 1991
telecommunications white paper, which imposed a ban on BT carrying
entertainment services in order to foster greater competition in
telecommunications.
The most significant part of the ban is the block on BT offering additional
TV over its network. It appears not to extend to video on demand.
The government's determination to curb BT emerged as Sir Iain Vallance, BT's
chairman, warned MPs that Britain would lose its leading telecoms position
in Europe unless BT went ahead soon with the construction of a national
fibre network.
Sir Iain told the House of Commons trade and industry committee, which is
studying options for such a network, that uncertainty over the future of the
enter-tainment ban was hampering BT in its investment planning.
'BT has a leading position in the UK in fibre technology,' Sir Iain said.
But its lead was 'partial and tenuous' and without a lifting of the ban it
was 'difficult' to see how BT could justify the Pounds 15bn investment
necessary to extend fibre to most of the country over the next decade.
The fibre would replace copper wires in the local networks, giving
flexibility and capacity for a range of new interactive services.
Sir Iain likened the possible consequences of failing to upgrade local
networks to the decline of the UK's manufacturing industry in the 1980s,
against competition from the Far East.
According to a senior Whitehall official ministers believe BT is engaged in
an elaborate bluff to secure an early lifting of the ban.
Under the 1991 white paper, BT is banned from carrying entertainment
services over its network until 2001, although Oftel, telecoms regulator,
can recommend lifting the ban from 1998.
BT is about to start a pilot project at Kesgrave, Suffolk, taking fibre
technology into 70 homes, providing services such as video on demand down
upgraded lines. Sir Iain agreed that a lifting of the ban in 1998 would not
significantly hamper BT.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Peace talks obstacles trip up the
bulls' stampede - Tel Aviv's change in fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a bullish run of several months, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has
entered a period of pessimism and caution as the market goes through a
crucial period of adjustment driven by political and economic uncertainty.
Since the boom of early January the TASE has been through a mini-crash with
a 12.5 per cent decline on the Mishtanim two-sided index of the 100 most
actively traded blue chip companies. The more speculative Karam index of the
smaller capitalised companies has fallen about 27 per cent.
From a high of almost 259 points in mid-January, buoyed by over-optimism
about the peace process, the Mishtanim index closed yesterday at 221.11, a
fall of 0.6. Analysts predict that the market will take several months to
recover.
Driving this decline of the market are four major factors: fear of further
increases in interest rates; a general feeling that the market was
overbought and making the shares, particularly on the Karam index, seriously
overvalued; the exposure of some of the worst insider trading and share
price manipulation since the 1983 bank shares scandal; and the political
uncertainty surrounding the peace process and the stability of the fragile
coalition government.
'The market was long overdue for a correction,' said Mr David Rosenberg, a
market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments. 'But unfortunately
several things came at once.'
The conditions for a decline in the market were set last December when the
central bank, concerned about meeting an inflation target of 8 per cent for
1994, lifted interest rates to 11.5 per cent as inflation reached 11.2 per
cent. Although the market did not respond immediately, fear of further rate
increases has haunted investors. Those fears will have been boosted
yesterday following the publication of an International Monetary Fund report
warning of the possibility of further rises in interest rates to combat
inflation.
However, the real decline in the market started in February as big
institutional investors announced that many shares were overvalued, the
relation between financial results of companies and their market value was
disproportionate, and the market was overbought.
The movement of many large investors away from small Karam stocks towards
larger capitalised Mishtanim stocks coincided with the revelation of an
investigation by the Securities Authority of share price manipulation by
brokers and fund managers and the subsequent arrest of three portfolio
managers and the investigation of at least a further six. The impact of both
these developments was felt most heavily on the Karam index, where shares
were most overvalued and also more easily subject to manipulation.
Also, the peace euphoria which characterised trading throughout the
August-January period finally ran out as talks with the PLO became bogged
down. The massacre of Palestinians by a Jewish fanatic in Hebron two weeks
ago, followed by the suspension of PLO-Israeli talks, delivered a final
crushing blow to investor confidence.
'This is a peace market,' said Mr Goldberg. 'Everything hinges on that. The
future economic development of Israel is contingent on the peace process and
the market closely reflects that.'
Although recent new issues just about mustered a subscription, poor
conditions on the market have led the government to postpone for five weeks
the sale of Shikun U'Pituach, a state-owned property development company
valued at Shk1bn, until later this month.
However, many analysts believe the market has swung too low and that the
recent decline is only temporary and should be put in the context of the
fact that the Mishtanim index has climbed 785 per cent in the past five
years, having weathered four major falls but then quickly recovered.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Asea, BBC shares up on rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Asea and Brown Boveri, the founding companies of engineering group
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, have surged on the annual pre-press conference
speculation that their directors will do the decent thing and order the
conversion of their paper into a single unified ABB share, writes Ian Rodger
in Zurich.
This time, the speculation originated in Stockholm, driving the Asea 'A'
shares up SKr20 to SKr581 on Monday, and by a further SKr6 to SKr587
yesterday when the Affarsvarlden index dipped 10.0 to 1,527.6. Zurich
arbitrageurs made sure that BBC bearers followed yesterday, showing a SFr19
rise to SFr1,129 as the SMI index fell 16.23 to 2,902.4.
ABB officials yearn for a single share to bolster the group's multinational
image, but the controlling families are in no hurry to create one.
The Swedish Wallenbergs now cast 33 per cent of the Asea votes with only 20
per cent of the capital, while the Swiss Schmidheinys speak for 14 per cent
of BBC with only 4 per cent of the capital.
In other Stockholm trading, Gambro was marked SKr15 lower to SKr399 in
reaction to results.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Bonn talks on Baltic tension: West to push Moscow on
withdrawal of ex-Soviet troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign ministers of the three former Soviet Baltic states will meet
today in Bonn with Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, amid
growing concern in western capitals over Russian-Estonian relations as the
deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory approaches.
Mr Kinkel has called for Russia troops to be withdrawn from Estonia and
Latvia on schedule, by August of this year.
The German minister said that the Russian side must not link the retention
of the military units to the provision of civil or voting rights of the
Russian population, as it has earlier threatened to do.
Similar calls have come in the past few days from the US and Britain. A US
state department spokesman said over the weekend that the US government was
'disturbed' by Russian negotiators raising again issues already agreed in
previous talks with Estonian officials.
The issue of troop withdrawals from the Baltics will be part of talks
planned between Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev and Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Vladivostok next Monday.
A British government statement said that 'according to the final act of the
Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe meeting in Helsinki in
1992, Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia quickly and in an orderly
manner, completely, and must not tie withdrawal to other issues'. The UK
statement continued: 'The international community has repeatedly underscored
that the withdrawal must take place without any other conditions. Therefore,
the Russian troops must be pulled out by August 31 this year, as announced.'
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister in charge of
negotiations with the Baltic states, told the newly formed Chamber of Public
Affairs, a presidential advisory body, that Russia did not link the rights
of Russians to troop withdrawals.
However, he said that economic and other agreements with Latvia and
Lithuania would be affected by a continued denial of rights.
According to the Baltfax news agency, Mr Churkin promised that 'a civilised
and respectful attitude' towards Russian language speakers would meet with
'understanding and a response' from Russia.
However, other speakers at the chamber denounced the treatment of Russians
and demanded redress.
Mr Mikhail Zadornov, a well-known actor, said that Russians were being
denied access to education and medical care and were being sacked from jobs.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water issues held up well as Credit Lyonnais Laing highlighted their
attractions. Analyst Mr Robert Giles said that on Monday afternoon the water
shares had moved to a yield relative of 150, a level not seen since the
general election.
He also pointed out that index-linked gilts, which the utilities tend to
track, had picked up. Mr Giles pinpointed Yorkshire, 11 higher at 536p after
547p, Severn Trent, unchanged at 556p after 572p, and Anglian 11 firmer at
515p, as his prime selections.
Property shares wilted in the weak market, undermined further by
disappointing end-December results from Wates City of London Properties.
Analysts said the slight increase in the net asset value to 72.8p was well
below market expectations of between 75p and 105p, although this was
tempered by the fact that much of the upward valuations in properties have
been in January and February.
Mr Graham Stanley at Goldman Sachs said: 'The recent shake-out among
property stocks has highlighted some areas of value for investors. But with
the uncertainties in the bond market, we remain cautious in the short term.'
Among the leading stocks, British Land fell 21 to 414p, MEPC 17 to 488p and
Land Securities 17 to 703p.
A trade press report that Air France might listen to offers for its Meridien
hotel chain prompted speculation in the market that Forte may be one
interested party. The UK group, still smarting from its recent failure to
land the Italian Ciga chain, is known to be keen to expand its international
portfolio.
Forte eased a penny to 268p. Talk over Forte's intentions towards the Savoy
Group saw the latter move up 37 to 1075p.
Standard Chartered was the pick of an uncertain banking sector, with the
shares building on Monday's strong performance and moving 16 higher to
1180p, partly reflecting increasing optimism over this morning's preliminary
figures, and the chances that the numbers could be accompanied by a share
split.
Also helping sentiment in stocks heavily exposed to Hong Kong and the Far
East was a story that Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, which has
triggered big moves in the Hang Seng index over the past year or so, was
preparing to increase its weighting in the Hong Kong market.
High street banks also held up well against the overall market, with some
leading brokers said to be preparing the case that the banks sector is ripe
for a rerating after its recent steep decline. The weakness across financial
sectors was triggered by fears of big losses in trading bonds and equities.
The takeover/rights issue speculation surrounding BAT led to renewed talk of
potential corporate moves in the UK composite and life sectors. Guardian
Royal Exchange, up a penny at 196p, was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100
stocks to close up on the session after speculators decided it could be a
prime target for attack.
Graham Group, the builders merchants hived off by BTR, made a scintillating
market debut. Offered for sale at 183p, Graham opened at 197p, marginally
above most expectations, and touched 203 1/2 p before easing to 202p by the
close. Volume reached 34m shares, easily the heaviest individual turnover in
the market.
Chemicals group Laporte was firmer after announcing full-year profits of
Pounds 107.4m, up from Pounds 86.6m last time. But the stock ticked back
with the market to end 20 down at 794p on uninspired turnover. Hoare Govett
raised its recommendation from hold to buy.
Reuters lost much of Monday's gain, sliding 56 to 2103p. Results at the high
end of some expectations sent marketing services group WPP up 2 to 125p. SG
Warburg forecast that WPP would 'exhibit 25 per cent average eps growth
between 1992 and 1996'.
News of losses at USAir, in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake,
left shares in the UK carrier off 11 at 419p after trade of 6.3m.
Shares in Williams Holdings put on 8 at 409p, with Morgan Stanley said to
have had a big buyer of the stock.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boddington talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a busy drinks sector, Boddington attracted speculative interest on talk
that Whitbread may be considering a hostile bid for the pub retailing group.
Such a move would cost Whitbread in the region of Pounds 440m.
Whitbread already owns around 20 per cent of Boddington, inherited from last
year's share restructuring with the Whitbread Investment Trust, and under
the government's regulations it must reduce its holding or make a bid.
Analysts were divided over the speculation, some arguing that Boddington's
portfolio of public houses, hotels and nursing homes would not fit with
Whitbread's business. Boddington shot forward 18 on the talk, closing at
294p.
However, Whitbread, together with some other brewing stocks, retreated in
line with the market and also on a cautious note from NatWest Securities.
The broker argued that the weak earnings growth potential of the sector
pointed to short-term underperformance. Whitbread slid 10 1/2 to 550 1/2 p,
Scottish  Newcastle 10 to 549p and Allied-Lyons also 10 to 625p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call rumours hurt BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours of a record-breaking rights issue settled on BAT Industries, the
tobacco and insurance conglomerate. Many analysts were sceptical but BAT's
share price tumbled 23 to 470p on heavy turnover of 8.6m ahead of figures
due today.
The speculation was that Compagnie de Suez would sell its Groupe Victoire
insurance arm. BAT refused to comment publicly but was believed to have
refuted the story to City analysts, while Suez denied that it was selling
its stake.
One analyst said the speculation had a 'superficial charm' because BAT was
known to be trying to extend its financial services operations in
continental Europe. However, it was also pointed out that BAT had not made a
paper-funded acquisition for 20 years.
Some cynical marketmakers felt predictions that BAT planned a two-for-nine
cash call to raise Pounds 2.6bn had an over-precise ring. If true, it would
be twice the size of the existing rights issue record of Pounds 1.3bn set up
by Zeneca in June last year. Others argued that the market rarely reacts
without a reason, and that rumours of a link had been building for some
time.
Another market favourite for a possible equity fund-raising was Cadbury
Schweppes, which also reports results today. The company would need in
excess of Pounds 1bn to mount a bid for Dr Pepper, of the US. The Cadbury
share price was steady at 494p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond falls hit share prices towards
the close - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading stocks stumbled badly at the close of trading yesterday as bond
markets fell sharply and rumours circulated that a large rights issue was
overhanging equities. The FT-SE 100 Index, which had been moving nervously
all day, extended an earlier loss to close 41.5 down at 3,264.4.
Hints of a big fund-raising surfaced in the stock market early, and market
analysts identified several possible names among leading companies due to
report profits this week. BAT Industries, weak yesterday, and
Cadbury-Schweppes both featured prominently in the list.
A deeper reason for the late setback in equities was a sell-off in
gilt-edged securities, the second of the session. Uncertainty in bonds
across Europe reflected uncertainty ahead of the outcome today of the
Bundesbank's variable rate tender, which has turned attention once again to
interest rate prospects.
Strategists noted that bond markets were again exercising the power over
stock markets which lay behind the shakeout of the past two weeks. But they
said it was too early to say whether the equity rally of the two previous
sessions had been seriously challenged.
Shares opened higher but were quickly tripped up as derivatives markets
turned off when transatlantic houses sold futures instruments. The first
bout of selling in bonds then hit, driving the Footsie down by more than 23
points. Selling was modest and shares soon steadied as losses in gilts were
reduced.
UK economic data, showing an unexpected jump in manufacturing output in
January, and thus leaning against the likelihood of an early cut in base
rates, was a discouraging factor. However, traders said that the stock
market was content to take its cue from bond prices.
The final setback came very quickly and caused some analysts to suggest that
market confidence was 'surprisingly weak'. There was little time for selling
to spread across the range and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished only 14.6
down at 3,923.1.
The FT-SE 100 Index was hit by weakness among the pharmaceutical stocks,
which still command a strong following among fund managers. There was also
weakness in the utility sectors, which had proved resilient during recent
weakness in equities. Property stocks, too, took heavy casualties after a
progress report from a leading City of London group cast a cloud over the
supposed recovery in the commercial sector.
Seaq volume increased to 676.2m shares from Monday's 576.3m, which returned
a retail business worth of Pounds 1.25bn, at the lower end of average daily
figures. Traders stressed that there was significant selling pressure
yesterday and questioned whether the stock market was yet able to free
itself from the pressure exerted by bond markets across Europe.
The equity market is expected to face a test of its attempted recovery
today, when the outcome of the Bundesbank money market repo tender may give
a hint on the near term trend of interest rates in Europe.
A batch of results from leading British companies will also underline the
latest trends in dividends. Equities outperformed against government bonds
during the recent sell-off with the help of improved dividend payments from
the banking sector. This improvement in returns to equity investors is
expected to continue if the recovery in the UK economy takes hold.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heavy fall in German bonds in afternoon trading brought a sharp retreat
in an already lacklustre derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
On the Liffe, early trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 which
opened at 3,295 saw the contract challenge the 3,300 level. But interest
fizzled out at 3,299 and a selling order from a leading US house reversed
the initial advance, leaving March to drift lower.
Further selling after the release of industrial and manufacturing production
figures dampened hopes of a reduction in interest rates. However, it was the
reversal in German bonds and the early falls in New York that brought the
heavy sell-off in March in the afternoon.
It closed at 3,249, down 46 from the previous close and at a 12-point
discount to its fair value premium to cash of about minus 8. Volume at the
official close was 13,632.
In the Liffe FT-SE Mid 250, volume in June exceeded that in the March
contract, which closed at 3,290. March traded 105 lots, against 200 in June.
On the OMLX, 9 lots were traded in the March Mid 250 and it closed at
3,923.10.
Liffe traded options saw volume of 32,399 contracts, of which 14,748 were
dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,500 in Land Securities.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as airline stocks
turn lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices were flat to weaker in light trading yesterday as stock
market investors took their cue from an uninspired bond market, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.50 at 3,851.72, but
off its low for the session of 3,842.72. The more broadly based Standard 
Poor's 500 slipped 1.03 to 465.88, while the American SE composite shed 1.38
to 467.68 and the Nasdaq composite declined 2.93 to 792.12. Trading volume
on the New York SE was 298m shares.
After achieving impressive gains on Monday - when the Dow climbed 24 points
 -the equity market was unable to maintain its upward momentum when trading
opened yesterday. This was in spite of a firm start for bonds, which edged
higher in the expectation that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest
rates soon.
Analysts said that, in the absence of fresh economic statistics, there was
little mot-ivation for investors to buy stocks.
Consequently, as soon as bond prices started to decline, turning an early
quarter-point gain on the benchmark 30-year bond into a quarter-point loss
by midday, stocks quickly followed suit.
The declines were most pronounced among Nasdaq issues, primarily because
they have outperformed the wider market in recent days and so were due for
some kind of sell-off.
Among individual sectors, leading airline issues were notably weaker after
Prudential Securities, the Wall Street brokerage house, lowered its 1994
earnings estimates for the five airline companies it covers, citing a new
round of fare-cutting in the industry.
The news left Delta Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 47 3/4 , AMR (parent of
American Airlines) down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 61 1/4 , UAL off Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 128 and Atlantic Southeast (traded on the Nasdaq market)
Dollars 2 cheaper at Dollars 31 3/4 . The only stock to buck the trend was
USAir, which firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 9 1/4 , having already suffered
from heavy selling on Monday when it issued a profits warning.
Varity jumped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/4 in busy trading after the
automotive, agricultural and industrial machinery maker announced a surge in
fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 27m, a result that exceeded analysts'
expectations.
The bigger cyclical stocks were mixed. Alcoa dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars
74 3/4 , Minnesota Mining  Manufacturing edged ahead Dollars 1/2 to Dollars
104 7/8 and International Paper rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 74 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto stock prices closed on a mixed note following moderate trading. The
market opened slightly lower and continued to fall through to midday.
However, sharp gains among media-related issues, prompted by the
announcement in the early afternoon that Rogers Communications and Maclean
Hunter had reached an agreement on Rogers' proposed takeover of Maclean
Hunter, helped to fuel a subsequent recovery.
The TSE 300 composite index lost 5.4 on the day at 4,431.2, but advancing
issues outnumbered declines by 395 to 362. Volume was 67.6m shares.
Rogers Communications 'A' advanced CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 24 and the 'B'
CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 23 1/4 . Maclean Hunter put on CDollars  5/8 at
CDollars 17 1/8 on heavy volume of almost 3m shares.
The media group index rose 2.8 per cent, but the mining sector fell 1.5 per
cent and golds lost 1.0 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weaker bonds unnerve bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond market weakness troubled a number of bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT tried to ignore bunds as it majored in chemicals and banks, but in
the end equities had to concede a small defeat. The Dax closed the session
15.1 higher at 2,124.04; this was actually 8.11 down from Monday's post
bourse close; and yesterday's attempt at an after-hours rally failed, the
Ibis-indicated Dax ending at 2,125.47 after an afternoon peak of 2,140.05.
Turnover climbed from DM9.4bn to DM10bn. BASF rose DM5.70 to DM311 and
Hoechst by DM6.90 to DM315.50, respectively gaining DM4.50 and DM2.50 more
after hours. Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt said that
dividend cuts of DM2 from both companies compared with consensus
expectations of DM3, and that there were strong recovery hopes for the
sector from the second half of this year.
Banks lost some of their fervour in the late afternoon but Commerzbank still
ended at DM357, after DM361, following a session gain of DM8 to DM355.
Expectations, ahead of today's repo tender, were that the rate could come
down into the 5.90 to 5.95 per cent bracket, after last week's fall from 6
to 5.97 per cent in the first variable bid tender for three months.
PARIS drifted, waiting for the outcome of today's German repo tender. The
CAC 40 index fell 3.46 to 2,216.43 and turnover rose slightly to FFr4.3bn.
Suez rose FFr8.20, or 2.4 per cent to FFr349.70 although the companied
denied rumours that its insurance subsidiary, Groupe Victoire, was about to
be sold, this time to BAT Industries of the UK.
In the retail sector, Carrefour climbed FFr75 to FFr4,145 after producing
strong results following Monday's market close. Remy recovered FFr4 of
Monday's losses to close at FFr238, following comment that Hong Kong's
higher taxes on spirits and champagne were less damaging that had been
assumed.
AMSTERDAM saw sellers coming into the market but generally managed to keep
at bay the persistent nerves triggered by a weakness in bonds. Most shares
managed to cling on to the sharp gains they made on Monday.
The AEX ended the day 1.85 points lower at 422.91.
A significant amount of the action came from US traders, according to one
broker.
KLM took a knock from US selling and fell back 80 cents to Fl 49.70.
Conversely, US dealers were keen on Philips and their buying edged up the
stock 30 cents to Fl 52.90.
Hunter Douglas, which enjoyed positive sentiment on Monday, fell back on
vague forecasts although results that although were in line with
expectations. Profit-taking weakened the shares further, and they slid Fl
3.10 to Fl 87.70.
MILAN continued higher but the mood remained tentative ahead of the
elections at the end of the month. The Comit index added 8.24 or 1.3 per
cent to 609.23.
Pirelli put in a strong performance but analysts said there was no news to
account for a rise of L71, or 3.3 per cent to L2,241. Benetton added L899 or
3.5 per cent to L26,728.
The banks saw profit-taking, Credito Italiano shedding L47 to L2,629 and BCI
easing L36 to L6,266. Telecoms issues continued higher on hopes that the
privatisation programme might be speeded: Sip rose L62 to L4,256 and Stet
was L86 ahead at L4,756.
MADRID followed the bond market lower, the general index easing 2.64 to
338.46 in turnover of Pta29bn. BCH fell Pta85 to Pta2,930 on Monday
evening's news that Moody's was considering a debt ratings downgrade for the
bank.
WARSAW advanced 2 per cent to a record high amid continuing demand for local
breweries in which German groups have taken stakes. The Wig index rose 299.6
to 20,760.3 although overall trading was described as subdued.
ISTANBUL slid 3.9 per cent in thin trading with many investors unwilling to
take fresh positions due to uncertainties over the outlook for the economy.
The composite index fell 582.32 to 14,506.39, for a two-day loss of 7 per
cent.

Industrial stocks stormed to their third successive peak in hectic trade
yesterday, taking the index 108 higher to 5,950, as bullish sentiment was
driven by strong demand from foreign investors, notably newly established
South Africa funds in the US, writes Matthew Curtin in Johannesburg.
The industrials sector carried the overall index to a new high of 5,118, up
46 on the day, as major mining financial counters also notched up sharp
increases, led by Anglo American, which added R1 at R228.50 for a cumulative
R38 advance since Monday last week. The gold shares index, however, shed 27
to 1,884.

After gaining substantial ground on active buying by domestic financial
institutions in the morning session, share prices met large-lot arbitrage
selling and profit-taking, leaving the market only marginally higher on the
day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index closed 86.51 up at 19,898.39 after opening at the day's
low of 19,826.28 and peaking at 20,090.71 in the early afternoon on active
buying of Nikkei 300 stocks by a UK brokerage.
Traders said profit-taking ahead of the March book closing seemed almost at
an end, while some domestic institutions were starting to buy shares.
'The supply demand situation is becoming quite positive,' said Mr Nobuhiro
Kaneda, general manager of Daiwa Securities' equity division. He expects the
Nikkei 225 to close the month - the end of the current business year -
within the range of 19,000 and 21,000.
Volume totalled 320m shares, against 343m. The Topix index rose 8.22 to
1,616.32, while the Nikkei 300 edged up 1.92 to 298.39. Advances led
declines by 565 to 423, with 197 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index was 1.31 firmer at 1,339.98.
Mounting concern over the rice shortage prompted speculative buying of foods
stocks. Hopes that Japanese consumers would eat more bread supported bakery
and flour milling shares, with Yamazaki Baking rising Y50 to Y2,190 and
Nisshin Flour Milling gaining Y70 at Y1,290.
Frozen food and processed food makers were also firm, with Ajinomoto, the
leading food company, moving up Y10 to Y1,320 and Nichirei, a large frozen
food maker, advancing Y12 to Y719.
Banks, heavily weighted in the Nikkei 300, gained ground, with Industrial
Bank of Japan adding Y30 at Y3,280 and Sanwa Bank Y20 at Y2,190.
Profit-taking depressed the motor sector, which was previously higher on
foreign buying. Nissan Motor, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y10
to Y874 and Toyota Motor declined Y10 to Y2,070.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 5.73 to 21,957.94 in volume of 99.2m shares.
Roundup
Regional markets took divergent paths.
TAIWAN plunged 3.4 per cent on stop-loss selling triggered by the market's
failure to rally on Monday, the first day of trade after the central bank
raised the ceiling on foreign investment.
The weighted index opened lower and sank for most of the session, ending
190.91 down at 5,456.68. Turnover shrank to a moderate TDollars 55.45bn from
Monday's TDollars 80.75bn.
The financial sector, which had surged in recent days on speculative buying
by big investors, dropped 4.3 per cent, with China Development losing
TDollars 7.50 at TDollars 123.
KUALA LUMPUR staged a strong rebound in the afternoon to close higher,
helped by gains in overseas markets and news that the British High
Commission in Kuala Lumpur had denied reports that London was contemplating
retaliatory action against Malaysia's trade ban.
The composite index was finally 10.58 up at 1,056.30 after setting a low for
the day of 1,035.62 in the morning.
Petronas Dagangan made its debut, the shares rising to a high of MDollars
7.95 before closing at MDollars 6.95, compared with the MDollars 2.80 offer
price.
SINGAPORE recouped some losses on late bargain hunting after a slight
recovery in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times
Industrial index ended 3.56 lower at 2,240.18 but after a day's low of
2,221.96.
HONG KONG finished sharply higher, aided by bargain hunting, but trading was
thin as sentiment remained cautious. The Hang Seng index was finally 233.03
ahead at 10,294.58, having jumped more than 270 points in early trade after
an overnight rally of Hong Kong stocks in London.
AUSTRALIA strengthened as 556m shares were traded, with the All Ordinaries
index fin-ishing 27.0 ahead at 2,171.7.
NEW ZEALAND took its lead from Wall Street and the NZSE-40 capital index
ended 30.75, or 1.4 per cent, up at 2,226.08. But turnover of NZDollars 39m
was only about half the level seen earlier in the year.
MANILA turned back after a firm opening as weakness in Benpres sparked other
stock sell-offs. The composite index shed 17.25 to 2,637.03. Benpres lost 80
centavos at 9.70 pesos.
SEOUL slipped lower, the composite index declining 10.77 to 884.85. Shares
made a slight recovery on a bout of selective buying of blue chips and
issues with low price-earnings ratios towards the close, after dropping more
than 14 points in the early afternoon.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Peseta features idle day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish peseta was under pressure yesterday after Mr Pedro Solbes, the
economics minister, said Spain would not be able to meet the Maastricht
convergence criteria for economic union, writes Philip Gawith.
The peseta fell to Pta82.33 per D-Mark, from Pta81.89 on Monday, after Mr
Solbes said Spain would be unable to reduce its public deficit to 3 per cent
of GDP by 1997 - a condition laid down by the Maastricht treaty for monetary
union.
The news was hardly a surprise, but it was enough to dampen sentiment on a
day when markets were stricken by a near paralysis of inactivity. Mr Nick
Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said a 'very large magnifying glass' was
required to discern signs of life in the market.
Mr David Barrett of NatWest Treasury commented: 'The foreign exchange market
does not have too many ideas of its own. It is looking for some sort of
outside impetus to give it direction.' The calm in foreign exchanges also
reflects a return to stability in bond markets after the turmoil of last
week.
The main currency crosses were all stuck in very narrow trading ranges.
Dollar/D-Mark traded in the DM1.7125 to DM1.7190 range; sterling/dollar in
the Dollars 1.4865 to Dollars 1.4915 area and dollar/yen in the Y104.98 to
Y105.51 range.
Sterling failed to gain support from figures showing British industrial
production and manufacturing to be stronger than anticipated in January. It
finished weaker in London against the dollar at Dollars 1.4875 from Dollars
1.4906 on Monday.
The Spanish economics minister's comments unsettled the Spanish bond markets
and pushed yields higher. With a close relationship between the currency and
bond markets, this weakness spilled over into the peseta.
Analysts said there was perhaps also an element of delayed reaction to last
week's 50 basis-point cut by the Bank of Spain in its key money rate. The
market also clearly believes that the Spanish government is keen to lower
rates to stimulate the weak economy.
Also weighing on sentiment was the announcement by Moody's, the credit
ratings agency, that it might downgrade the paper of Banco Central Hispano.
Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW, said this had reminded the markets
of the problems of another leading Spanish bank, Banesto, which ran into
trouble in December.
UK economic data releases showed industrial production up by 0.8 per cent in
January for a year-on-year 4 per cent increase, and manufacturing output up
1.1 per cent from December. But sterling gained no support from this and
ended at DM2.5516, a pfennig down from Monday's close. Most of this weakness
came in a spate of late afternoon selling.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the
'slight rumblings' about Prime Minister John Major's leadership had been a
negative. 'The leadership talk has focused people's minds on the political
problems that might occur later in the year.'
Mr Turner said sterling appeared still to be suffering from the negative
fallout that followed last month's rate cut. Many in the market chose to
interpret that easing of policy as indicating a government view that the
pound should not be allowed to rise too high on a trade-weighted basis.
The D-Mark was fairly steady ahead of today's repo announcement, when the
Bundesbank will announce the terms at which it is prepared to put money into
the system. Banks are expected to have bid lower rates, encouraged by the
view that the Bundesbank will continue easing credit.
The lowest rate at today's allocation is expected to be in the 5.90 per cent
to 5.95 per cent range. Last week the Bundesbank switched to a variable rate
repo for the first time since mid-November.
It had been setting tenders at a steady fixed rate of 6 per cent since
December. The central bank allowed the repo rate to fall by 3 basis points
to 5.97.
The dollar traded quietly ahead of today's German repo announcement. It
finished slightly easier at DM1.7155 from DM1.7184 and against the yen at
Y105.225 from Y105.850. In New York it closed at DM1.7147 and Y105.25.
Affecting the dollar's fortunes is the view that, on the one hand, the
Bundesbank will only cut rates cautiously. On the other, although there is
little dispute that the next move in US rates will be up, the timing of this
is less certain.
Mr Parsons argues that having destabilised markets with its last move, the
Federal Reserve will be anxious to avoid a repeat performance when it next
tightens. This may require a more cautious approach.
The Bank of England did not operate in the early morning round yesterday
after forecasting a liquidity shortage of Pounds 800m in the UK money
market. In the afternoon it put Pounds 93m into the market through bill
purchases at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent. It gave Pounds 515m of
late assistance.

copper concession

<TEXT>
Cambior of Montreal has won the concession to develop the Peruvian copper
deposits known as La Granja, in the northern department of Cajamarca.
It outbid three other Canadian companies - Cominco, Teck and Placer Dome -
as well as Cyprus Minerals of the US at public auction in Lima on Monday.
Cambior will invest Dollars 25m over a maximum of five years, with an
additional payment of Dollars 1m a year for the exploration option. It also
offered the Peruvian state a 5 per cent royalty on all future sales.
La Granja has mineral reserves of around 320m tonnes, averaging 0.78 per
cent copper and four grammes of silver a tonne. If feasibility studies prove
positive Cambior could invest Dollars 450m in an initial leaching operation
to produce copper cathodes. A concentrator plant would follow.
Mr Raul Otero, president of Mineroperu, the state company that owns the
deposit, said anticipated sales could top Dollars 300m a year. That would
mean Dollars 15m a year in royalty payments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium Bahrain, the Gulf's largest aluminium producer, announced
yesterday that it was cutting annual output by 20,000 tonnes a year to help
support the market, reports Reuter from Manama.
Further reductions would depend to a large extent on a concerted approach by
the entire aluminium-producing community, it added.
'Several discussions have taken place among the Middle East smelters on ways
of supporting the present international drive to re-establish balance
between supply and demand in the primary aluminium market,' according to a
company statement. 'Following these discussions, Aluminium Bahrain has
decided to reduce production by 20,000 metric tonnes per annum.'
Alba produced a record 450,000 tonnes last year, after doubling its capacity
in 1992.
Western producers have announced output cuts totalling about 850,000 tonnes
since agreeing the multinational plan in January, and prices have risen by
8.5 per cent. But analysts have suggested that it will be difficult to reach
the cuts target of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes a year without the
participation of producers not represented at the January talks, which
include those in the Middle East.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil slides as Opec hopes fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices in London and New York slipped below psychological support levels
yesterday as traders saw little scope for any decisive action from this
month's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In London the benchmark Brent Blend for April fell below the Dollars 13 a
barrel barrier to Dollars 12.99, just 9 cents above the five-year low of
Dollars 12.90 reached last month. It later recovered in late trading to
about Dollars 13.05. In New York the Nymex price for April crude fell at one
point in early trading below Dollars 14 a barrel.
A rollover of the present Opec production quota of 24.52m barrels a day was
'. . . written into the price', according to Mr Lindsay Horne, a trader at
the London branch of Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank.
He said it was 'intuitively wrong for the market to go into an Opec meeting
below Dollars 13 a barrel, but the price could spike down to around Dollars
12 ahead of the meeting'.
The market perception that Opec would simply roll over its present quota
into the second quarter of the year was reinforced yesterday by news agency
reports suggesting that Iran was worried that any Opec production cuts would
be offset by sharply rising production from independent producers, such as
the UK and Norway.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India prepares ground for
flower sales drive - Plans for a dramatic expansion in production and
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India has served notice that it intends to join the ranks of the major
flower producing countries in the next few years. Encouraged by the federal
government's decision to make floriculture a priority area for development,
a large number of established business houses and new entrepreneurs have
decided to grow flowers on a commercial scale for the export market.
'Like so many other tropical countries, India should have taken the
initiative to grow flowers scientifically on a commercial scale a long time
ago,' says one industry official. 'After all India has plenty of land, water
and sun to grow a large variety of flowers. But we should be able to make up
for the lost time.' The liberalisation of the import of technology and
mother stock plants will make it possible for India to grow flowers for the
world market, he says.
The Agricultural and Processed Food Product Export Development Authority has
estimated that of the nearly 34,000 hectares of land under floriculture,
only about 10,000 hectares are used to produce cut flowers. Experts believe
that it should be possible to commit as much as 500,000 hectares to
floriculture in the next few years. By amending the land ceiling act, which
allows corporations to acquire large tracts of land for horticulture, the
government of Maharashtra has set the trend for the other Indian states.
World trade in flowers, estimated at over Dollars 25bn, is growing at a
highly encouraging rate of 11 per cent a year. This has enabled countries
like Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, Kenya, Thailand and Malaysia to expand
quickly the production base for flowers. In contrast, India's exports of cut
flowers, foliage and tissue culture plants amounted to a meagre Rs130m
(Pounds 2.75m) last year.
But in view of the strong interest of the Indian corporations in
floriculture, it is now felt that the flower export target of Rs1bn for
1996-97 'is too conservative'.
The locations identified for the development of intensive floriculture are
Pune and Nashik in Maharashtra, Bangalore in Karnataka, Thiruvananthapuram
in Kerala, Kalimpong in West Bengal and Shrinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. But
except for Pune and Nashik - which are close to the Bombay airport, where
APEDA has built cold storage facilities for flowers - the centres identified
do not as yet offer 'good international air connections', industry officials
point out.
The government, which has given a 25 per cent air freight subsidy on flowers
is talking to several foreign airlines about securing adequate cargo space
for flowers. It also has agreed to create the necessary infrastructure at
the major airports in the country for storing and handling flowers.
The Indian companies entering the flower business have chosen Europe,
south-east Asia and the Far East as their 'principal target markets'. The US
is the single largest market for flowers but 'India is not targetting it
because of the distance'.
'The most productive flower growing period in India is September to March.
This coincides with the peak seasonal demand for flowers in Europe, when
little is grown locally. We want to make the best use of this season,' say
the industry officials, who at the same time admitted of their many
handicaps. 'Our knowledge of constructing ideal greenhouses is limited. We
lack good plant materials.
'Without foreign technical know-how, we will not be able to produce flowers
for the world market. And our knowledge of flower marketing is practically
nil.'
But the liberal import of floriculture and tissue culture technologies,
greenhouses, mother stock plants and seeds are enabling the Indian companies
to make a confident start in flower business. As for marketing, most Indian
companies are seeking the assistance of Dutch companies to ensure that their
flowers realise good prices at the auction.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold steadies after touching
3-month low - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GOLD price steadied after sliding overnight on Japan's announcement that
it was planning to sell about 90 tonnes of melted-down surplus gold coins.
In London the price hit a three-month low of Dollars 375.45 a troy ounce at
the morning fixing before ending at Dollars 376, down Dollars 1.60 on the
day.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER was generally steadier but seemed
content to trade within a fairly static Dollars 1,900-Dollars 1,920 a tonne
range for three months delivery.
London Commodity Exchange May COCOA futures closed Dollars 12 up in London
up at Dollars 930 a tonne and traders thought fresh buying might be
triggered if it broke above Dollars 937.

Budapest - A wholesale revolution has brought an array of exotic produce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budapest's wholesale market, on the outskirts of the Hungarian capital,
offers a fine example of the remnants of the old eastern bloc sampling the
fruits of the market economy.
A steady stream of battered Lada cars processes through the damp spring
morning past stalls brimming with imported oranges, grapefruits and kiwi
fruit. The drivers - grocers and traders from the city - pause to see who is
offering the keenest price before chugging on.
The market, which provides 90 per cent of Budapest's fresh fruit and
vegetables, is a pioneer in the reconstruction of eastern Europe's troubled
agricultural sector, being the largest in the region and the first organised
along western lines.
Mr Gabor Demszky, the mayor of Budapest, was in London yesterday to sign a
Dollars 6.7m (Ecu5.9m) loan agreement with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to help provide the market with a cold store,
bigger parking and service areas and facilities for ripening bananas.
Thanks to the market, bananas have become an everyday fruit in Budapest,
says Ms Anne Bosche-Lenoir, the EBRD's project manager in Hungary. But the
problem is that 'the bananas are already yellow when they arrive, so the
value is being added somewhere else'.
The bank sees competitive wholesale markets as the key to reducing
distribution costs, creating efficient pricing and breaking the stranglehold
of Mafia-style operators on traditional east European production and
distribution networks.
It has received requests from Albania to Alma Ata for help in setting up
markets. But progress has generally been slow. Attempts failed in Moscow and
St Petersburg because of problems over land reform and resistance from
organised criminals.
Budapest was different. The city authorities had set up the market
themselves in 1991. They created a company to operate it, with shareholders
including a leading Hungarian savings bank, an agricultural co-operative,
whose land was taken over for the market, and several small companies, as
well as the municipality.
Within a year of opening, it had become severely congested. About 95,000
farmers, anxious to break with the discredited co-operative distribution
system and sell their produce direct, descended on the market in the first
summer, queuing for up to three hours to get in. Annual turnover rose to
350,000 tonnes, five times that of the old wholesale operations in the city
centre, and the market found itself handling half the country's fruit and
vegetable imports.
The EBRD, drawing on wholesale systems in France, Italy and the Netherlands,
stepped in to provide advice on reorganising operations. This included
setting up television screens to track prices and introducing a proper
accounting system. Then it agreed to fund part of the Dollars 26.4m
extension, allowing the city rather than the government to guarantee a loan
for the first time.
'Without our money, they wouldn't have been able to finance this
infrastructure,' says Ms Bosche-Lenoir. 'There's no long-term finance
available in Hungary.' To minimise the company's borrowing costs,
wholesalers are being asked to pay a lump sum for leasing rights before
construction begins in May.
The market has been a blessing for Mr Gabor Czeizler, managing director of
Wienimpex, a wholesale operation distributing greenhouse produce from
south-east Hungary. He has seen his annual turnover nearly double since he
moved out from the city centre. 'This place is reachable from all
directions,' he says. 'There's a very good network of roads.'
Mr Lajos Juhasz, who works on a stall in the covered part of the market, is
glad of its existence too. He used to be deputy manager of a butcher's shop,
but the state meat company that owned it went bankrupt and he was out of a
job. 'The money is better but the hours are very long,' he says. The market
has also spawned rivals in other cities, which has made the competition
tougher.
For the people of Budapest, the increased availability not only of exotic
fruits but also of peppers, one of Hungary's most typical vegetables, is
welcome. 'Now we can buy tomatoes and peppers in the winter,' one woman
explained. 'They come from Holland, but they don't have the flavour of our
own Hungarian peppers.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Recovery ends as investors reduce their
risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile recovery in European government bond markets ended yesterday,
with 10-year bonds shedding about a point in most markets.
'Although markets had consolidated over the last few days, investors are
still very nervous and are using the strength to off-load (long) positions
while speculative funds are re-establishing short positions,' said Mr Keith
Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International.
'There's a much greater awareness of risk in the market,' said Mr Jouni
Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. 'Many long-term
investors have had their belief in the bull market story shattered and
prefer to reduce their risk on any uptick,' he added.
Market participants are keenly awaiting the Bundesbank's allocation of
variable-rate securities repurchase agreements today. Most traders expect a
small drop in the minimum repo rate to around 5.90 - 5.92 per cent from last
week's 5.97 per cent. In the event of a small reduction, 'we could see a
brief rally, but people would probably look to sell at that level rather
than buy,' said Mr Kokko.
Weaker US Treasuries and rumours of near-term monetary tightening by the US
Federal Reserve also put pressure on European bonds.
German bunds set the pace, with most activity centred in the futures pits,
where trading was very technical. The June future broke several key support
levels on its way down. 'Each time we approached a support level, the
contract went through it like a hot knife through butter,' said a German
dealer. The contract hit a low of 96.40 and stood at 96.60 in late London
trade, down 0.83 points on the day.
Bunds dramatically underperformed their Dutch counterparts, which have seen
less foreign selling in recent weeks.
'Foreign holdings in the German market were massive, while at the long end
of the Dutch curve, domestic holdings have outweighed,' said Mr Torsten
Bohler, senior bond analyst at UBS. 'Dutch domestics are holding on to their
paper, while German domestics can't absorb all the paper sold by the
internationals.'
The Dutch 10-year benchmark yielded some 10 basis points below its German
counterpart yesterday, after being only 2 basis points below two trading
days earlier.
The release of stronger than expected industrial output data got the UK gilt
market off to a bad start and prices slid further in the afternoon on the
back of weaker bunds. The June long gilt futures contract on Liffe fell by
about 1 3/32 points from Monday's close to 112 9/16 .
French bonds also slid, fuelled by domestic selling. All eyes are on the
Bundesbank's repo, which is seen to set the pace for much-needed rate cuts
in France.
On the Matif, the March bond futures contract ended at 126.22, down 0.46
from Monday.
Japanese government bonds rose on late short-covering in Tokyo and continued
to post small gains in London trading. However, sentiment remains subdued by
trade tensions between Japan and the US as well as supply concerns.
After firming at the opening, US Treasury prices edged steadily lower across
the maturity range yesterday, undermined by a stronger retail sales report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/4 at 92
11/32 , to yield 6.853 per cent. The two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 7/16
, yielding 4.910 per cent.
Trading was quiet from the start, although prices did post modest gains in
the first few hours of business.
The market, however, could not maintain its early upward momentum, and as
soon as the buying petered out, prices began to decline. The selling
intensified in the afternoon following the release of a
stronger-than-expected weekly retail sales report from the Johnson Redbook
service.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: SP cuts ratings of Japanese
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard  Poor's, the international credit rating agency, has lowered the
debt ratings of Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
two of Japan's leading long-term credit banks, because of their larger than
expected exposure to bad loans.
The agency lowered IBJ's senior debt rating from AA minus from A plus, while
LTCB's senior debt ratings were cut from A to A minus.
SP said substantial write-offs will ultimately be necessary by IBJ to
resolve its bad loans to housing loan companies. However, the write-off
process has been limited due to IBJ's earnings levels and the limit on the
sales of its cross-shareholding portfolio.
LTCB's downgrade reflects the large amount of restructured loans, or loans
on which the bank has lowered or waived interest to help restructuring, on
top of Y731bn in non-performing loans.
Meanwhile, SP has also downgraded the claims-paying ability ratings of four
non-life insurance companies and two life assurers. Japan's non-life
insurance sector is suffering from reduced profitability due to higher loss
ratios, insufficient premium rates and greater catastrophe costs. Increased
competition is also expected to hurt the country's life assurers.
The claims-paying ability ratings of Chiyoda Fire  Marine, Dai-Tokyo Fire 
Marine, Nichido Fire  Marine, Nippon Fire  Marine, Yasuda Mutual Life and
Meiji Mutual Life were downgraded to AA plus from AAA.

for CSFB unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston's Russian subsidiary has been granted a securities licence
by the Russian ministry of finance.
The licence allows the firm to trade and underwrite equity and debt, and is
the first to be granted to a foreign-owned institution.
The bank's main focus will be on the over-the-counter stock market, where
turnover is currently an estimated Dollars 800m a month, according to Mr
Boris Jordan, co-head of the Russian subsidiary.
Mr Jordan expects Russia's capital markets to expand rapidly, due to growing
interest from emerging market investors. He predicts financial investment of
around Dollars 5bn in Russia this year.
Other foreign banks have been slow to follow CSFB's lead in Russia, citing
lack of sufficient flows of business and infrastructure difficulties. But Mr
Jordan insists that CSFB's Russian subsidiary 'has been a profitable
operation from the start'.
Merrill Lynch of the US is increasing its presence in China with a second

Mr Li Peng, China's premier, urged Mr Daniel Tully, Merrill Lynch chief
executive, at a meeting in Beijing this week to further strengthen his
company's involvement in China's financial sector. It is already operating
in Shanghai.
Merrill Lynch is now a chief underwriter of Chinese company shares and
government bonds in the international financial markets. It has raised more
than Dollars 4bn for China through 23 securities issues since 1992.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Turkey postpones Dollars 750m global
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent price weakness in government bond markets claimed another victim
yesterday when the Republic of Turkey pulled its Dollars 750m global bond
offering at the eleventh hour. Two weeks ago, a heavy fall in US Treasuries
led the National Bank of Hungary to delay its global offering.
Joint lead manager Salomon Brothers blamed poor market conditions for
Turkey's postponement. It said US Treasury yields had risen five basis
points since price talks with the borrower earlier in the day.
Turkey had considered inserting a three-year put option into the 10-year
offer to make it more palatable. Although price talk was around 250 basis
points over the yield on 10-year Treasuries, the put meant Turkey would have
to pay 350 basis points over three-year Treasuries. This was thought too
high.
Although Turkey decided to wait for better conditions, syndicate managers
reported a wide range of borrowers making enquiries about raising funds in
the Eurobond market.
The Inter-American Development Bank confirmed that it was considering a
Eurobond offering in sterling, the proceeds of which would be swapped into
Swiss francs. The 10-year bond was likely to raise around Pounds 125m and
could be launched this week provided agreement could be reached on terms.
The bank said S. G. Warburg was involved in the discussions. Price talk was
10 to 15 basis points over the yield on 10-year UK gilts.
The main deal was a Pounds 250m offering of five-year Eurobonds from Chubu
Electric Power of Japan. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 40 basis points
over five-year gilts, was described as generous in the light of the
borrower's superior credit rating. Joint lead manager S. G. Warburg said
realistic pricing was needed to re-open the market after the recent fall in
bond prices.
Nevertheless, syndicate managers said the pricing was not enough to ensure
swift placement and estimated that only half of the bonds had been sold by
the close of business.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: BCH under review for
downgrade by Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has placed Banco Central Hispano,
Spain's largest bank in terms of assets, under review for possible
downgrade.
The development affects about Dollars 2.5bn of debt, and BCH's share price
fell 3.3 per cent yesterday in Madrid. The bank is currently rated A1 and
Prime-1 for long and short-term certificates and Prime-1 for commercial
paper.
This is the first move by a rating agency on a Spanish bank since the
Banesto crisis broke last year. The Spanish central bank sacked Banesto's
board after finding that it had grossly overvalued its assets. Banesto is to
be sold to a domestic bank next month.
Moody's said it would focus on BCH's core earnings, including its reliance
on non-recurring earnings, on the quality of its assets and on the progress
of a cost reduction programme that followed the 1991 merger between Banco
Central and Banco Hispano Americano that created BCH.
BCH's net interest income narrowed in 1993 and its operating profit margin
was significantly boosted by strong trading revenues earned during last
year's volatile interest rate and currency movements.
Bad debts, which were above 7 per cent of its loan portfolio, eased slightly
and BCH claims now stand at 6.8 per cent, below the sector average.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Valeo earnings steady at FFr705m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Valeo, the French car parts company, yesterday said it had managed to
maintain profits last year in spite of the depressed state of the European
motor market.
The group made net profits of FFr705m (Dollars 199.5m) in 1993 against
FFr700m in the previous year. As a result the board proposed raising its net
dividend to FFr8 from FFr7 in 1992.
Valeo, like other suppliers to the European motor industry, has been
affected by the downturn in demand. It sustained a 2 per cent fall in sales
during the year to FFr20.2bn compared with FFr19.8bn.
However, it said that it had managed to outperform the rest of the market by
limiting the fall in its European sales to 10 per cent during a year in
which the European market declined by 16 per cent.
The group increased car part sales in North America and Asia. The proportion
of its exports sold outside Europe rose during the year to about 22 per
cent, against just 16 per cent in 1992.
One of the main reasons for the improvement in Valeo's net margins was the
reduction in its financial costs due to a decline in its borrowings. The
level of net debt fell to FFr1.16bn by the end of 1993, from FFr2.15bn for
the same period in 1992.

Robert Champion de Crespigny speaks to Kenneth Gooding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny, chairman of the Australian Normandy
Poseideon group, yesterday celebrated his unexpected victory in the hostile
and contested bid for Aztec Mining, he was also quietly burying another
important deal.
Poseidon Gold, the subsidiary through which the Aztec bid was launched, also
hoped to build a big gold business outside Australia via a joint venture
with Metall Mining, the Canadian subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft of
Germany.
It was forecast that the new PosMetall Gold would emerge in three or four
years with an annual output of 300,000 troy ounces of gold from a global
spread of precious metal interests. PosMetall would then have been floated
in North America and Australia.
This plan, however, has crumbled following the recent financial collapse of
Metallgesellschaft. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, new chief executive, has made clear
he intends to sell Metall. Mr de Crespigny said it was impossible to go
ahead with the proposed joint venture because he did not know who would
control Metall. 'It is safe to assume that the deal is dead,' he said.
Nevertheless, a joint venture gold project under way in Turkey with Metall
would continue. Poseidon had expected the Turkish project to be producing in
time to fill a predicted dip in its gold output. However, production there
had been delayed by permit problems, so the bid for Aztec was made to fill
the gap.
When the Aztec offer seemed like failing, Poseidon bought 40 per cent of the
Boddington gold mine in Western Australia for USDollars 116m (ADollars
83.45m) from Reynolds Metals of the US. This deal has been challenged by
another Boddington shareholder, but Mr de Crespigny said he was sure
Poseidon would take the stake.
Poseidon's main interest in Aztec was its Bounty gold mine, half-way between
Perth and Kalgoorlie, where Poseidon operates Australia's biggest single
gold mine, the Superpit.
The bid will also contribute to Normandy Poseidon's strategic objective of
having within five years three core divisions - gold, base metals and
industrial minerals - each capable of producing annual operating profits of
ADollars 50m.
It will give the group control of Golden Grove, which owns the Scuddles zinc
mine and also brings with it the Woodcutter mine. Between them, they have an
annual output of 200,000 tonnes of zinc. However, Mr de Crespigny said it
was not certain that Woodcutters would be kept by his group, which would
certainly sell Aztec's coal interests.
He said there was no need for Normandy to raise new capital to cover the
Aztec deal, and that the group's net debt would be virtually eliminated by
the end of this year.
Mr de Crespigny faces two areas of uncertainty: his relationship with the
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, which owns nearly 20 per cent of
Normandy, and charges brought by the Federal director of public prosecutions
over the 1989 takeover.
Anglo recently reshuffled its assets and handed its Normandy stake to
Minorco, its Luxembourg-based subsidiary.
Mr de Crespigny, who rarely gives press interviews, said the relationship
with Anglo was 'very special,' and he expected it to continue that way.
However, Minorco had only 5 per cent of its assets in Australia and would
obviously want more.
'How that will come out I don't know,' he said.
He also admitted there was likely to be some competition for global projects
between Normandy and Minorco. Normandy is concentrating on Australia,
Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos. South America was too far away and a move into
Africa, on Anglo's doorstep, would, he said, 'be like kicking sand in your
mother-in-law's face'.

<TEXT>
The Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the aircraft maintenance
subsidiary of the Swire Pacific Group, has reported a 15 per cent increase
in profits, to HKDollars 447m (USDollars 57.8m) for calendar 1993 from
HKDollars 387.9m the previous year. It attributed the rise to improved
margins.
Profits rose on the back of good use of facilities, boosted productivity and
stringent cost controls, the company said. Line maintenance revenues
improved as Haeco took in hand a 12 per cent bigger slice of aircraft
movements at the colony's Kai Tak airport. Concerns over the high level of
inflation in the colony, of around 8.5 per cent, have prompted the drive for
enhanced productivity.
Earnings per share rose to HKDollars 2.41, against HKDollars 2.09 in 1992.
Shareholders are to receive a dividend of 71 cents, up from 64 cents the
previous year. The results were in line with market expectations.
The company said it was continuing talks with the Provisional Airport
Authority over a licence to operate maintenance facilities at the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok. At the same time, it is anticipating that volumes
at Kai Tak will continue to rise and expects to be able to secure healthy
levels of work this year.

earnings climb

<TEXT>
De Beers, the South African company which dominates the world diamond trade,
is lifting its total 1993 dollar dividend by 7 per cent. The lift confirms
the stout turnround in the diamond business from the difficult conditions in
1992.
The dividend is increased to 84.4 US cents a share from 79.1 cents in 1992.
Earnings rose 16 per cent to 230 cents from 199 cents a share.
The shares reacted strongly to the news, climbing to a new high of R116 on
the Johannesburg stock exchange, before retreating to R115 at the close. Mr
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was 'pleased' with the results,
which were underpinned by the first increase in four years in global retail
diamond sales.
The group's Central Selling Organisation (CSO) sold a record Dollars 4.37bn
in rough diamonds in 1993, against Dollars 3.42bn the year before, led by
good demand in the US and east Asia. Mr Jeremy Pudney, CSO marketing
director, said Korea, Taiwan and Thailand had overtaken France and Germany
as the group's most important markets after the US, Japan and Italy.
However, demand in Japan and Italy remained weak.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a director, said the group's relationship with Russia
remained uneasy, although sales in December of uncut diamonds from the
country's Treasury stockpile - in breach of a marketing agreement between De
Beers and the government - had not been repeated so far this year.
Pre-tax income rose to Dollars 789m from Dollars 728m, reflecting the
overall improvement in the jewellery trade and an increased contribution
from South African operations, boosted by the build-up to full production at
its new Venetia mine.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson said results from Centenary, De Beers' Swiss-based arm,
were hit by retrenchment costs at Namibian mines and the Irish-based
industrial diamond division, plus its smaller share of total diamond sales
as Venetia's output increased.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian TV network cautious
in spite of rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network Australia, the country's dominant commercial
TV operator, yesterday announced an after-tax profit of ADollars 48.51m
(USDollars 34.9m) for the six months to end-December, up by 25.3 per cent on
the same period of 1992-93.
However, Nine warned that the increased costs associated with covering
overseas sporting events - including the Winter Olympics and the current
South African cricket tour - would peg its second-half profit at around last
time's figure.
'The directors are not anticipating a second-half result significantly above
last year,' said the company.
Nine Network said its earnings before interest and tax rose by 15 per cent
to ADollars 72.7m, with TV advertising increasing by over 10 per cent,
mainly in the first quarter.
Total group revenue stood at ADollars 312.4m, compared with ADollars 288.1m
last time - an increase of 8.4 per cent. Nine said the slower overall
increase reflected the sale of the Perth radio stations and flat revenue
growth at Sky Channel.
Ashton Mining, the Australian diamond producer, yesterday reported a net
profit of ADollars 36.6m in 1993, up from ADollars 35.4m the previous year.
The 1993 figure is scored after an ADollars 11.8m net abnormal item (nil in
the previous year). Ashton said the performance was 'particularly pleasing,
given the lower diamond sales revenue resulting from the full-year impact of
the CSO deferred purchases in 1993'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ADollars 287m (USDollars 206.5m) battle for Sydney-based Aztec Mining,
the metals group, came to an abrupt end yesterday. PosGold Investments, part
of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, snapped up
more than three-quarters of its shares in a stock market raid.
The victory came just a day after PosGold lifted its cash offer for Aztec
from 68 cents a share to 74 cents, and waived certain conditions, allowing
it to buy its target's shares in the market.
No sooner had dealing opened yesterday, than it was announced that Alumax,
the US group which held a 37 per cent interest in Aztec, had sold its shares
to PosGold at the higher price. By late afternoon, PosGold said it had
raised its interest to around 85 per cent of Aztec's equity.
Aztec directors, who had previously recommended an all-paper merger with
Pancontinental Mining, reluctantly urged other shareholders to follow suit.
They acknowledged that the fall in Pancon's price since its bid was
announced meant that offer was worth less than PosGold's.
'While directors do not believe that the revised PosGold offer reflects the
full value of Aztec, in view of the fact that control of Aztec will now pass
to PosGold the directors recommend to shareholders that they accept the
revised PosGold offer of 74 cents per share, rather than the Pancontinental
offer,' they said.
Aztec shares ended the day six cents higher, at 74 cents, while the bid's
success lifted PosGold by 14 cents, to ADollars 3.20. Pancontinental also
gained. Its shares rose 12 cents to ADollars 1.82.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rogers wins control of Maclean

<TEXT>
Rogers Communications, Canada's leading cable TV operator, has finally won
Maclean Hunter, a leading Canadian and US cable and publishing group, with a
bid worth about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn).
Rogers yesterday raised its five-week-old offer from CDollars 17 to CDollars
17.50 per share and extended the expiry date from March 15 to March 31.
This delay was needed because the US Federal Communications Commission must
rule on Rogers' proposal to sell-off Maclean Hunter's US cable interests, a
ruling which could not be received by March 15.
Maclean Hunter shareholders will get CDollars 17 a share, plus 50 cents a
share to be paid via a special dividend from Maclean Hunter, assuming the
Rogers' bid is completed. But they will not share in the proceeds of the
sale of Maclean Hunter's US cable network.
Both Mr Garfield Emerson, chairman of Rogers, and Mr Ronald Osborne,
president of Maclean Hunter, said the price was fair. The Maclean Hunter
board recommended the offer to all its shareholders. Maclean Hunter's poison
pill shareholder protection plan will be waived.
Rogers has said it would sell Maclean Hunter's US cable interests to reduce
debt assumed for the takeover. It has also said it may sell Maclean Hunter's
Canadian publishing interests, since its primary aim was to get control of
Maclean Hunter's valuable Canadian cable business concentrated in southern
Ontario.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian insurer to sell
Californian unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C. E. Heath International, the Australian liability insurer which was spun
off from its UK-based parent via local stock market flotation in 1992, is
selling C. E. Heath Compensation and Liability Insurance Company (or Heath
Cal), its Californian workers' compensation subsidiary, for ADollars 132m
(USDollars 94.3m).
The purchaser of the business is Care America, a subsidiary of UniHealth
America. The sale, according to the Australian group, should generate a
pre-tax profit of about ADollars 30m and is likely to be completed during
the next few months.
C. E. Heath International said the funds generated from the sale would be
ploughed back into expanding its interests in Australia, the UK and Asia.
It mentioned growth possibilities in the Australian workers' compensation
market - 'both Victoria and South Australia are expected to provide such
opportunities in 1994-95' - and in liability and travel insurance in the UK.
Other areas targeted for expansion include marine insurance and the Asian
markets.
News of the sale came as C. E. Heath announced a profit after tax of
ADollars 38m in the 12 months to end-December. This compared with ADollars
16.3m in the previous year. Net premiums were ADollars 371.1m, up 27 per
cent, and there was a small underwriting profit of ADollars 4.6m.
Heath said operating profit before unrealised gains on investments and tax
stood at ADollars 40.3m, up from ADollars 38.6m last time. Net unrealised
gains on investment increased by ADollars 31m before tax, to ADollars 17.7m,
and accounted for ADollars 11.8m of the after-tax profit.

Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's second largest steel company, has
changed its senior management for the third time in 18 months.
The unexpected appointment of Mr Kim Mahn-je, a former deputy prime minister
for economic affairs, as Posco chairman at the company's annual meeting
followed the sudden resignation of Mr Chung Myunk-sik as chairman and Mr Cho
Mal-soo as president.
They are reported to have resigned in protest over government interference
in the management of the company, whose largest shareholder is the state
with 35 per cent.
Mr Kim is the first outsider to head the profitable steelmaker, which was
established in 1967, and his appointment may provoke criticism from the
company's trade union.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ticklish business of disclosure
 -All may not be best for Hong Kong banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reporting season for Hong Kong's banks, now virtually complete, has been
notable for the extent to which disclosure grabbed the attention of
investors.
Two of Hong Kong's local banks, Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia, both
suffered, the latter because investors got tired of management being
high-handed in its refusal to part with any information, and the former
because investors did not like what they saw.
To add to bankers' worries, there emerged a lobby to end past privileges.
The Consumer Council assailed the banks for reaping monopolistic profits
from rigging interest rates on small deposits; it also called for greater
disclosure of banks' inner reserves. According to Mr Roger Edgley, banking
analyst at Crosby Securities: 'Hong Kong has one of the lowest levels of
disclosure; even banks in Indonesia reveal more.'
Bank of East Asia, celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, got caught by
investors' doubts after it unveiled a HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129m)
after-tax profit, some 46 per cent up on 1992's earnings. Given the paucity
of information it published, analysts speculated that 1993 earnings had been
bolstered by the use of past reserves.
Mr David Li, the bank's chief executive, was forced to issue a denial the
day after the bank released its results; weeks later he was still having to
explain himself. According to Mr Li, 1993 profits were augmented by the
unwinding of previous provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Hang Seng's problem was the opposite: too much disclosure for the market's
liking. It had always been known that Hang Seng had a portfolio of
securities, but not one with a value of HKDollars 12.4bn, including
unrealised gains of HKDollars 9.6bn. As one broker wryly observed: 'Buy Hang
Seng as a geared play on the market.'
More seriously, analysts were concerned that Hang Seng recorded virtually no
growth in its underlying banking business, in spite of its position as the
premier retail bank in the colony.
According to Mr Steven Li, banking analyst with brokers Jardine Fleming,
Hang Seng's profit growth was attributable to lower bad debt charges, a
one-off reduction in staff costs, and trading profits on the equities
portfolio of more than HKDollars 1bn. With bank regulators and investors
concerned about banks' exposure to Hong Kong's property market, Hang Seng is
set for a period of soul searching, he says.
'Hang Seng has made its money the same way as the rest of Hong Kong, through
the property and stock markets. But there are limits to property lending,'
he says.
The Hong Kong banking sector divides according to size. Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank, its 63 per cent-owned listed subsidiary, dominate the
market. Next come the medium-sized banks, led by East Asia and including Dah
Sing and Dao Heng.
The third sector, the minnows, is where the greatest number of listed banks
lie. These small banks enjoyed very strong profits growth on the back of
expanding balance sheets. For most, 1993 profits grew by rates in excess of
40 per cent, compared with the majors whose profit growth was in the teens.
These high growth rates are, however, relatively easy to sustain for banks
which are at an early stage of the growth cycle. Their size also allows them
to behave in ways which regulators may find unacceptable in large banks.
There is, for example, evidence that some of the small banks are raising
funds outside the interbank money market. They are going directly to large
corporate clients of competitors and bidding deposits off them, sometimes at
rates as high as one percentage point above interbank rates.
Hong Kong's benign interest rate outlook is, however, about to change. The
US Federal Reserve Board signalled last month a change in the direction of
interest rates; Hong Kong cannot remain immune from higher interest rates
for long as its currency is linked to the dollar.
But Hong Kong is a highly profitable place for sellers of retail financial
services. This was underlined by the results of Manhattan Card Co, the
recently floated credit card subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank in the
colony, which posted a 73 per cent rise in net profit to HKDollars 154.7m
last year. Hong Kong is a place where people like to spend money.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australia seeks to simplify
buy-backs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Lavarch, the Australian Attorney-General, yesterday released a
proposed simplification of rules for corporate share buy-back schemes. The
changes could encourage more Australian companies to consider the option.
Although share buy-backs are permitted in Australia, they are subject to
complex conditions. Critics of the current regulations claim compliance
costs are heavy, and the safeguards against abuse are unnecessarily
detailed. As a result - and in contrast to the US, where buy-backs are
commonplace - few Australian companies have attempted to introduce such
schemes.
Under the new proposals, companies would be able to buy back shares, other
than redeemable preference shares. However, directors would have to sign a
written declaration stating that, in their opinion, the company would be
solvent immediately after the buy-back. They would be personally liable if
the buy-back led to insolvency.
A company would also be allowed to buy back more than 10 per cent of its
ordinary shares in a 12-month period, provided shareholders approved.
Restrictions on the source of funds for buy-backs would be eased, as would
accompanying constraints on the timing of new issues - for example, under
dividend reinvestment plans. At present, any company operating a dividend
reinvestment plan is effectively barred from a buy-back scheme.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fourth-quarter rise boosts
Varity shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Varity rose sharply yesterday after the US automotive,
agricultural and industry machinery group reported a big improvement in
fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 27m, or 59 cents a share, on a
fully-diluted basis. A year ago, Varity earned Dollars 11.2m excluding
extraordinary charges.
The results were well above Wall Street analysts' expectations, and Varity
shares leaped Dollars 4 1/4 to close at Dollars 48 3/4 (a new 52-week high)
on the New York Stock Exchange.
The strong final quarter took 1993 profits to Dollars 76.3m, up from Dollars
33.4m a year earlier. After taking a non-cash charge to cover changes in
accounting principles, however, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars
71.5m in its latest fiscal year.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive, said the accelerating recovery
in the North American automotive industry - the chief market for Varity's
brake products - was the main factor behind the earnings improvement, while
cost containment measures continue to help the group weather the impact of
the recession in Europe.
Among its three business segments, the automotive products business,
Kelsey-Hayes, made the biggest contribution to earnings growth in the final
quarter, posting operating income of Dollars 22m on sales of Dollars 297m.
Last year, Kelsey-Hayes earned Dollars 16m on sales of Dollars 249m.

from CDollars 331m, or CDollars 3.90, in 1992, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. The results include special charges of CDollars 107m, against
CDollars 433m, for Trilon's share of losses by Gentra, the former Royal
Trust Co.
Before special charges, Trilon was profitable in the fourth quarter of 1993
and expects to remain in the black through 1994. The real estate brokerage
has been restructured, and merchant banking reduced.

battle scars

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group being acquired by
Viacom after a Dollars 10bn takeover battle, yesterday reported a
third-quarter net loss of Dollars 36.6m, due largely to disappointing
audience figures for some recent film and television shows.
The loss was in line with a forecast loss of Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m
which Paramount made last month in the final stages of the takeover battle
between Viacom and QVC Network, the television home shopping channel.
QVC yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 2.8m, or 6 cents
a share, down from Dollars 18.9m, or 40 cents, in the same period of last
year, after taking Dollars 34.8m of pre-tax costs (an Dollars 18.8m net
loss) for its unsuccessful Paramount offer.
However, QVC's operating income in the fourth quarter was 34 per cent
higher, at Dollars 53.2m, compared with Dollars 39.5m, on revenues up 9 per
cent at Dollars 372.5m, compared with Dollars 341.8m. Fourth-quarter net
income also included a Dollars 1.1m extraordinary charge from the
accelerated write-off of debt placement fees.
Mr Barry Diller, chairman, said the results confirmed QVC's core business
was strong and 'though obviously somewhat distracted while pursuing
Paramount, we have not been deterred from our strategy to put in place an

Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the government-controlled mining
company and the world's largest iron ore exporter, yesterday launched an
American depositary receipts (ADR) programme on the US over-the-counter
market.
The company said the Level 1 programme was the first step towards a Level 3
ADR issue, which would involve an increase in capital and listing on a US
stock exchange, but imposed much stricter accounting requirements.
Under yesterday's operation, each ADR represents 250 CVRD preferred shares,
which have limited voting rights.
CVRD is Brazil's largest exporter, with net sales of Dollars 2.45bn last
year. Its share price increased 162 per cent in dollar terms in 1993 and has
grown by 43 per cent this year, helped by a very strong local market. Morgan
Guaranty Trust, a subsidiary of J. P. Morgan, is acting as sponsor.
Sakura Bank, a leading Japanese bank, has announced that it will issue
Y100bn (Dollars 945m) in convertible preferred stock to boost its capital
levels, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
It will be the first Japanese bank to issue preferred stock since the
finance ministry eased restrictions on capital-raising programmes using the
instruments last year.
The bank said its capital-to-assets ratio would rise by 0.5 percentage
points to 9.6 per cent after the issue, which would enable it to expand its
balance sheet by increasing lending.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Time for USAir to face the music
 -Labour cuts could be its last chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is so long since USAir, the sixth biggest US carrier, made an annual
profit that shareholders must have forgotten what it feels like. On Monday,
they learned that this is not the year in which their memories are going to
be refreshed.
Not only did USAir dash hopes that it would share in the recovery taking
other big US airlines into modest profits; it warned that its sixth
consecutive year of losses would take it even more heavily into the red than
last year's Dollars 349m pre-tax.
The serious question now facing USAir's shareholders - and none more so than
British Airways, which has spent Dollars 400m since early last year to buy
and maintain a 24.6 per cent equity stake in the airline - is what future
awaits such a poorly performing company in a market suffering so badly from
overcapacity.
The precedents do not augur well. More than 100 airlines have gone bankrupt
since the US airline industry was deregulated in 1978, many of them bigger
and better known than USAir. Braniff International, Eastern Airlines, Trans
World Airlines and Pan American World Airways are just a few.
Nor has the cut-throat competition in the US domestic market shown any signs
of alleviating. If anything, it has grown worse, as overcapacity has enabled
new operators to enter the industry by picking up redundant aircraft and
crews on the cheap.
USAir's main markets are in the eastern US. Its primary hubs are in
Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Philadelphia, all of which have direct
flights to New York's JFK international airport where they connect with
British Airways flights.
USAir has always suffered the disadvantage that its routes are predominantly
short-haul in an industry where the revenue-to-cost ratios are more
favourable on long-haul routes. Until recently, however, it had drawn
comfort from the fact that many of its routes were effective monopolies.
That started to change last year when Southwest Airlines, the biggest and
most successful of the new breed of low-cost airlines, moved into its
market, setting up a rival hub in Baltimore. Things got worse in January
when Continental Airways, fresh out of bankruptcy with a new, low-cost
structure, announced that it was introducing its so-called Peanuts Fares to
many routes in the east.
USAir was left with no alternative but to slash its own fares, which it duly
did last month. But the inevitable consequence will be that its already very
serious losses will grow still further, unless it can significantly cut its
costs - and that means getting its labour unions to accept drastic cuts in
jobs, wages and conditions of employment.
Seen against that background, it becomes clear why British Airways is
threatening not to fulfil its agreement to take its stake in USAir to 44 per
cent in the next four years by investing another Dollars 450m. Until now,
USAir's labour unions have had little reason to accept the need for drastic
cuts because if the airline ever got into really serious trouble, British
Airways would be there. Now, British Airways has taken that security away.
Within hours of these developments on Monday, USAir's management had met
representatives of its four labour unions and asked them to start talks.
Some indication of the scale of the cuts that will be needed can be gleaned
from the fact that its operating costs of 11.2 cents per available seat mile
in last year's fourth quarter were more than 50 per cent higher than those
of its competitors.
If the experience of other large US carriers offers an example, one likely
outcome of the negotiations will be a deal under which a substantial
proportion of the airline's equity is sold to its employees in return for
labour concessions over a period of years. Under similar deals, employees
have already taken 37.5 per cent of Northwest Airlines and 45 per cent of a
restructured TWA, and are due to receive 53 per cent of United Airlines.
Such action may be the least unattractive alternative. Mr Kevin Murphy, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank, points out that
no US airline yet has lost as much as USAir without either reaching a deal
with its unions - or going bankrupt.

<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the recently privatised French chemicals group, is
reactivating plans to take full control of Institut Merieux, the Lyon-based
pharmaceuticals company.
Last October, the two companies announced terms for an offer whereby
Rhone-Poulenc, which owns 51 per cent of Merieux, would buy all the
remaining shares.
However, the offer was suspended in December when Pasteur Merieux, a
subsidiary, was forced to stop production of its albumine vaccine because of
regulations over the collection of human placentas, the basic raw material.
Under the terms of the original offer Rhone-Poulenc was to offer 77 of its
own shares for every five Institut Merieux shares. Under the new offer, the
chemicals group is offering 15 shares for each share in Merieux.
Merieux is a world leader in the development of vaccines. However, it is a
relatively small player in an intensely competitive industry, with net
profits of FFr396m (Dollars 67.1m) on sales of FFr6.6bn in 1992.
Rhone-Poulenc said at the time of its initial offer that it expected, by
taking full control of Merieux, to benefit from potential synergies between
their human and animal health businesses.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Foreigners eager for Czech
sell-offs - Shares in 861 groups are on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, offered British businessmen a
plethora of uplifting quotes from Adam Smith, the 18th century prophet of
laisser faire capitalism, in London yesterday. But he had little concrete to
offer those seeking an easier way through the Czech bureaucracy to
potentially lucrative contracts and participation in the privatisation of
Czech industry.
The Czech Republic, he told a luncheon audience organised by the Adam Smith
Institute, British Gas and Bass, the UK brewer, had an embarrassing surplus
of foreign capital. The central bank was having to neutralise the inflow by
domestic monetary manoeuvres. Czech companies were looking forward to the
time when they would be investing abroad in foreign assets, not just
absorbing foreign capital, he added.
It was a tongue in cheek performance, and the audience loved it. Foreign
investors have indeed been buying Czech companies and shares on the rising
Prague bourse. They are closely following the outcome of the second wave of
voucher privatisation which begins next month and should be completed this
summer.
Shares in 861 companies with a book value of Kcs155bn (Dollars 5.3bn) are on
offer, compared with about 1,000 companies worth more than Dollars 7bn last
time. But interest has been lively with over 6m Czechs out of a population
of 10.3m registering for voucher books.
Only Czech nationals can participate in the voucher scheme, but foreign
investors are poised to move in on targeted companies once the process has
been completed. Most will deal directly with investment funds, several of
which have links with leading foreign institutions such as Credit Suisse
First Boston, Corus of the US, Austria's Creditanstalt and Raiffeisen banks,
and Epic, a Vienna-based fund.
The 400-plus funds played a large role in the first privatisation wave,
winning control of 72 per cent of privatised shares. They compete fiercely
to persuade investors to entrust them with the management of their
portfolios.
Incentives for investors include promises of returns several times the
Kcs1,000 cost of a voucher book, cheap loans and credits and other benefits.
At least one fund has offered an immediate cash payment of Kcs7,000 with
another Kcs1,000 promised later to buy the rights of voucher book holders,
thereby getting around a ban on investors selling the books.
Foreign investors are locked out of the initial process, but they can buy
shares from funds and individual shareholders once privatisations are
completed. They can buy shares on the stock exchange or the rival
over-the-counter RM-System, although lack of market liquidity and listed
stock reduces opportunities. Stakes in companies can be bought directly from
the government or the government-owned National Property Fund, as many large
privatisations involve a mix of vouchers, and sale by public tender or
direct sales.
Companies to be privatised include:
SPT Telecom: 26 per cent to be sold by vouchers. The government will decide
shortly on a short-list of foreign partners to be offered a 27 per cent
stake, although a partner is unlikely to be chosen before 1995.
There is strong interest from foreign telecommunications companies. SPT had
net profit of Kcs3.5bn on revenues of Kcs18.4bn last year.
CEZ: about 4 per cent of the its share capital will be sold by vouchers; 30
per cent was sold in the first wave. CEZ is one of the country's largest
companies with a quasi monopoly of power generation - competition comes from
a few small power plants run by municipalities.
It expects pre-tax profits of Kcs18.5bn on operating revenues of Kcs49bn for
1993. It is one of the most popular stocks on the market, given blue chip
status by foreign analysts, although the company could face environmental
problems. Chemopetro and Kaucuk Kralupy: two refineries which have attracted
strong interest from Shell, and a separate consortium of Conoco, Agip and
Total.
Some 36 per cent to be sold by vouchers, and at least another 30 per cent to
be reserved for a foreign partner.
Kablo Kladno: cables manufacturer; 66 per cent to be sold by vouchers, an
additional 30 per cent reserved for Felten and Guillaume of Germany.
Karosa: bus and truck manufacturer; more than 50 per cent to be sold by
vouchers, with about 36 per cent sold to Renault Vehicules Industriels.
Synthesia: the country's second largest chemicals company manufacturing
organic chemicals and explosives including Semtex. Has switched most of its
exports from former Comecon trade bloc to the West. Profits of Kcs199m on
sales of Kcs4.6bn last year.
With the range of companies narrower than in the first privatisation,
competition is expected to be strong for favoured stocks.
For international institutional investors, the second wave offers an
opportunity to raise their holdings in one of eastern Europe's fastest
growing emerging markets. About Dollars 200m in portfolio investment has
moved into the Czech Republic since last June, and more is expected.
'There could be another Dollars 500m waiting to come in through
institutional funds,' says Mr Peter Galbraith, an analyst with Epic.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hoechst and BASF cut dividends
as earnings fall

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst and BASF, two of Europe's biggest chemicals concerns, yesterday
announced reduced dividends and earnings for 1993. BASF cut its pay-out to
DM8 from DM10, Hoechst to DM7 from DM9.
Although the German-based groups provided little more than basic 1993 data
yesterday, the results further encouraged share traders who have shown
increasing interest in the recovery value of cyclical stocks, notably
chemicals makers.
Sales and earnings figures from both groups suggested the rate of decline
had slowed during the past year, while national economic growth figures,
released yesterday, helped reassure markets that the worst of the domestic
recession was past.
Hoechst shares, up DM6.90 to DM315.50 at the end of official trading,
continued rising after hours, while BASF had risen DM5.70 to DM311 by the
close.
Group pre-tax profits at Hoechst fell 42 per cent to DM1.23bn (Dollars
723m), after being 50 per cent down after six months. Turnover, which was
2.4 per cent lower at the half-way mark, rose 0.4 per cent to DM46bn.
The company complained of price pressure and very low European demand, which
was evened out by improved overseas business. Net group earnings were 36 per
cent lower at DM756m.
The weakness of domestic markets was highlighted by a 58 per cent slump in
pre-tax earnings and a 7.6 per cent fall in sales at the German parent,
Hoechst AG.
A similar pattern emerged at BASF's parent, where German turnover fell 9.6
per cent, and pre-tax earnings were 16 per cent lower. Group sales were down
3.3 per cent at DM40.57bn, after being 7 per cent lower after six months.
Pre-tax profits, 50 per cent lower in the first half of the year, were down
15 per cent at DM1bn.
Both groups pressed ahead with savings programmes last year, shedding 10,000
employees between them. Further job losses are expected. Analysts expect
more joint ventures, disposals of non-core, unprofitable businesses, and a
search for profitable new ventures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors' Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations in
Europe suffered a 56 per cent fall in net profits to Dollars 600m in 1993.
Mr Louis Hughes, GM Europe president, said in spite of the decline the
Opel/Vauxhall operations had remained the most profitable volume car
business in Europe for the fourth year in succession. Several of GM's
closest rivals in Europe suffered big losses last year.
Mr Hughes said the Opel/Vauxhall financial performance had been depressed by
one-off charges totalling about Dollars 800m arising from restructuring
measures and exchange rate losses.
The Opel/Vauxhall workforce was cut by about 7 per cent to 84,900 people at
the end of 1993 from 91,500 at the end of 1992 and there was widespread
short-time working at several GM Europe plants.
Mr Hughes warned that little growth was expected in the west European car
market this year, although a stronger recovery could begin in 1995 with
sales forecast to exceed 12m next year. According to industry estimates new
car sales in west Europe fell by 15 per cent last year to 11.45m units.
Mr Hughes said GM was planning to further internationalise its operations
using the Opel car operations as the spearhead.
The Opel technical development centre in Germany was the group's lead design
and engineering organisation outside North America.
Opel designed products are being built in eastern Europe, the Middle East,
Asia, Africa, South America and Australia.
Mr Hughes said GM Europe was planning small volume assembly projects in
India, Indonesia and Thailand and eventually in Malaysia. In the long term
studies were being conducted that could lead to Opel car assembly in China,
Russia, Zimbabwe and the Philippines.

Sandvik, the Swedish speciality steel and carbide group, yesterday reported
a 30 per cent increase in profits for 1993, saying a four-year decline in
demand for industrial products was over.
'There are now clear signs that the world market will expand during 1994,'
it said.
Mr Per-Olof Eriksson, group chief executive for more than 10 years, would be
retiring in May, it said. He would be succeeded by Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom,
head of Sandvik Tooling.
With market conditions again weak last year, the company relied on the fall
in the krona and restructuring to lift profits to SKr1.98bn (Dollars 253m)
from SKr1.52bn. The improvement was achieved in spite of a sharp drop in
financial income, partly because of lower interest rates.
Sales rose 26 per cent to SKr21.8bn in 1993, in spite of lower volumes in
all business areas except steel. Excluding currency factors and structural
changes, sales were down 5 per cent, largely because of depressed demand in
Europe, which accounts for 55 per cent of sales.
Orders rose 28 per cent to SKr22.1bn, but only process systems showed a
clear increase in volume terms.
Star performer last year was the steel division, which lifted profits to
SKr461m from SKr159m.
The group's biggest division, cemented carbide, lifted profits to SKr1.28bn
from SKr879m, helped by currency factors. The saws and tools division was
weakened by the performance of a German unit, Sandvik Belzer, but losses
were cut to SKr3m from SKr82m.
The dividend is being increased to SKr2.25 per share from SKr1.90. Earnings
per share rose to SKr4.90 from SKr4.20. The group expects both sales and
profits to rise this year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Continental declines to DM74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax earnings at Continental, the German tyre maker, fell more than half
to DM74m (Dollars 43.5m) last year, according to Mr Hubertus von Grunberg,
group chairman.
He blamed the decline in the automotive industry. He said the company
increased volume deliveries, but prices had been depressed by over-capacity
in the tyre industry.
The results had once again been burdened by losses at General Tire, the US
subsidiary, which had not fulfilled its promises to return a break-even
result, he said.
Unit sales of car and commercial vehicle tyres increased 2 per cent and 3
per cent respectively, while group turnover fell 3.3 per cent to DM9.4bn.
Last year's profits fall was less dramatic than expected, while sales and
earnings had increased in the first two months of the current year, he said.
Continental would respond to the continuing downward pressure on prices by
improving quality and reducing fixed costs rather than cutting output. A
further 2,000 jobs would be cut this year, following a reduction of 4,900 in
1993.
Mr von Grunberg forecast a positive result this year but refused to comment
on dividend prospects. Continental last paid a dividend in 1990.

CS Holding, the financial services and industrial group built around the
Credit Suisse bank, has reported a 69 per cent jump in net profit to
SFr1.99bn (Dollars 1.4m) for 1993, due mainly to outstanding earnings
generated by commission and trading business.
The group's preliminary statement revealed assets 39 per cent higher at
SFr346.5bn during 1993, largely because of the acquisition of Swiss
Volksbank, Switzerland's fourth largest bank. Group equity jumped 47 per
cent to SFr15.8bn at the year end.
The figures confirm CS as the largest Swiss financial group, surpassing
Union Bank of Switzerland with assets of SFr311.3bn at the year end. Swiss
Bank Corporation, the third largest, had assets of SFr207bn. UBS is the most
profitable of the three, with net income last year of SFr2.27bn, and is the
group with the largest equity base, SFr21.7bn.
Volksbank, which was on the verge of collapse before being taken over, did
not contribute to CS group profits last year.
CS said its operating profit from trading in foreign exchange, precious
metals and securities more than doubled to SFr5.2bn from SFr2.3bn while net
commission income advanced 40 per cent to SFr4.5bn. Net interest income grew
19 per cent to SFr3.2bn because of the inclusion of Volksbank activities.
Group cash flow expanded 78 per cent to SFr5.26bn, but provisions for bad
loans and depreciation soared 84 per cent to SFr3.26bn. Return on equity was
14.3 per cent or 13.2 per cent after deduction of minority interests.
The directors will make a dividend recommendation following the closing of
the CS financial year at the end of March.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: McDonnell Information joins
market worth Pounds 260m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Information Systems is coming to the market through a placing and
public offering at 260p a share, valuing the Hemel Hempstead-based computing
services company at Pounds 260m.
Some 73.1 shares are being issued, of which 42.5m are new shares with the
balance being sold by existing shareholders. Some 35 per cent of the offer,
which closes on March 17, is available to the public. Dealings commence on
March 24.
The flotation will raise Pounds 110m of new equity and Pounds 80m for
existing shareholders. The net proceeds, Pounds 107.4m, will be used to
repay debt and redeem preference shares.
MDIS management bought the company from McDonnell Douglas of the US for
Pounds 121m last year. Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, said he would not
be selling his shares. After the flotation management will hold 7.6 per cent
of the equity.
On a post-flotation pro forma basis, the company had pre-tax profits of
Pounds 21.3m in the year to December 1993. Out of earnings per share, it
would have paid a notional net dividend of 6.25p a share.
The placing and offer, one of the largest flotations this year and the
biggest in the information technology field, has been fully underwritten by
Baring Brothers, which is to sponsor the issue.
COMMENT
MDIS is a mature company with revenues of almost Pounds 150m and a record of
management competence. Operating profits as a percentage of turnover have
risen from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the past three years in spite of
the recession. The company specialises in areas such as central and local
government, the emergency services and the health sector, which will show
sound, if not outstanding, growth. As a public company, it could reasonably
hope for more success in bidding for larger contracts. The offer price
suggests a p/e of 18.2 that is fractionally higher than the sectoral
average. Notional gross dividend yield at the offer price is 3 per cent. The
shares seem fairly priced and should prove a core holding for computing
services aficionados.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Diversification helps Polypipe advance 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polypipe, the Doncaster-based manufacturer of industrial and commercial
plastic pipes and fittings and other domestic plastic products, yesterday
reported a 16 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.4m
to Pounds 7.45m.
The profit improvement came on turnover which grew by 23.6 per cent to
Pounds 60.8m (Pounds 49.2m) in the six months to December 31 including a
full 6-month contribution from Allerton Glass which was acquired last May
and merged with GCA Windows.
Earnings per share advanced by 15 per cent to 3.2p (2.78p) and the interim
dividend is being raised by 7.6 per cent to 0.71p (0.66p).
Polypipe's shares closed 2p higher at 175p.
Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, said the results reflected 'the continuing
strength of both the group and its operations and the continuation of our
strategy of expanding wherever possible each of our businesses, investing in
plant and tooling and extensive product development.'
The latest figures also highlight the success of the group's diversification
since 1990 into non-core products by broadening its operating base while
remaining in the fields of plastics extrusion and moulding.
Sales of the group's other domestic plastic products, which now include
bathroom fixtures, windows and garden furniture, advanced by 35 per cent to
Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 20.9m) while operating profits from these activities
grew by more than 50 per cent, from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.91m.
Overall operating profits increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 7.48m (Pounds
6.54m) despite relatively large increases in the purchase price of PVC which
affect Polypipe's sales of above and below ground drainage systems.
PVC prices have increased by 17 per cent since January last year. Since then
Polypipe has increased its product prices twice. Mr Bryan Stock, finance
director, said the higher PVC prices trimmed pipe margins in the first half
by between 1.7 and 1.8 percentage points but added that margins should be
mostly restored in the second half.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 29,000 (Pounds 132,000) and the group
again ended the period with net cash and nil gearing. Capital expenditure in
the first half totalled Pounds 7.69m (Pounds 4.96m.)

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Linread 23% up despite exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Linread, the Midlands-based fasteners and precision components group,
brought forward the announcement of its annual results to announce a 23 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits and an increased dividend.
This follows a warning last December that exceptional charges in the second
half would be double those of the first, indicating a total for the year of
about Pounds 800,000 to pay for restructuring.
However, by bringing forward restructuring plans for this year the
exceptional charge was higher at Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 743,000). But this
still left pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31 at Pounds
857,000, against Pounds 697,000 restated for FRS 3 and to reflect changes in
the accounting policy for a leasehold property.
Earnings per share were 3.88p against a restated 2.21p. The proposed final
dividend is lifted to 2.35p (2.25p) making a total of 3.92p (3.75p).
Turnover was lower at Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 37.8m) while operating profits
fell from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 1.08m. The pre-tax advance reflected a
sharp reduction in interest payable to Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 794,000).
This fall came because of tighter stock controls related to the greater
efficiency of the group's manufacturing techniques. Gearing was cut from
50.1 per cent to 28.4 per cent.
The tax charge, at Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 428,000), was again 'abnormally
high'.
The group has now finished its immediate restructuring programme and expects
to benefit quickly from any upturn in its main automotive and aerospace
markets. 'In certain sectors we anticipate increasing our market share,
particularly in North America,' Mr Peter Tahany, the chairman, said.
The shares rose 18p to 134p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expamet just in the black with Pounds
17,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expamet International, the building, industrial and security components
group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 17,000 for 1993,
compared with a 1992 loss of Pounds 20.6m, restated for FRS 3.
The company has completed an aggressive restructuring programme, and the
1993 figures included a Pounds 2.1m write-off for redundancy costs, and
Pounds 1.5m losses from the sale or closure of businesses.
Expamet said the redundancy programme would achieve overall cost savings of
Pounds 3m in 1994.
Despite the impact of provisions on shareholders' funds, gearing fell from
125 per cent to 89 per cent, with borrowings cut from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds
11.2m.
The share price reacted favourably to the announcement, rising 8p to 77p.
Turnover fell to Pounds 126.9m, compared with Pounds 139m, but there was a
marginal increase in sales from continuing businesses in all three of its
main sectors.
The building and industrial businesses suffered from the performance of
subsidiaries in continental Europe, because of the effects of deepening
recession last year. Both sectors showed marginal declines in operating
profit.
The security sector, however, achieved a 47 per cent increase in profit to
Pounds 2.5m, helped by increasing export sales and a stronger domestic
market.
Mr John Roberts, chairman, said the first two months of 1994 had been
encouraging. He added that the cost base of the group has been cut so that
all the operating businesses can be profitable, 'irrespective of market
conditions', he said.
The company announced a final dividend of 1.25p, making a total of 2.5p,
down from 3.25p.
The company said it planned to return to consistently higher levels of
dividends.
Losses per share were much lower at 0.75p (32.48p).

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Battle for Barrhead in unusual twist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Barrhead Sanitary Ware, the Scottish workers co-operative,
took an unusual turn when one class of shareholder failed to achieve the
necessary threshold to approve one of the offers for the bathroom products
group.
It is thought there may be a danger that the other offer may also fail to
meet the threshold set down in Barrhead's articles, leaving the company in
danger of going into receivership.
An extraordinary general meeting was called to consider the offer from Baxi
Partnership, an employee-owned heating engineering company based in Preston,
Lanca- shire.
The meetings of the ordinary voting and preference shareholders agreed
unanimously to let the Baxi offer proceed but the ordinary non-voting
received the support of only 61 per cent against a threshold of 75 per cent.
The votes came despite the Barrhead board switching their support from Baxi
to Shires, a Bradford-based bathroom products group. The board now fears
this offer may not proceed under the present articles.
If both offers fail Baxi has offered to make a secured loan of Pounds
450,000 available to keep the company going and has proposals for
strengthening the Barrhead board. In the event of reaching agreement on the
Baxi proposals the Barrhead board intends simplifying its constitution.
Barrhead was formed in April 1992 by former workers of Armitage Shanks
following the closure of its works at Barrhead near Paisley.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: FT-SE committee refuses to change Inchcape
classification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee has again turned down
a plea by Inchcape to move its shares from the vehicle distributors sector
to diversified industries, writes Maggie Urry.
The committee met on Monday, March 7, to discuss quarterly changes to the
constituents of sectors which will take effect on April 1. The new system
came into operation at the start of this year.
Inchcape said the committee's decision was 'a great disappointment'. It has
repeatedly argued that although 60 per cent of its 1992 profits derived from
'motors importing, distribution and retailing', only 14 per cent came from
the retail side.
Inchcape said it made a further submission to the committee arguing that
factors which affect UK motor retailers were different to those which bear
on Inchcape's activities.
The group is planning to alter the split of profits disclosed when it
publishes 1993 results on March 28. It will divide the motor retail profits
from the importing and distribution activity.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Valves division disposal boosts Suter to
Pounds 38.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in interest payments helped Suter, the industrial conglomerate,
to increase 1993 profitability in spite of continuing tough trading
conditions in its main markets.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 15.2m, adjusted for FRS 3, to Pounds
38.2m, which included a Pounds 19.1m gain on the disposal of the group's
industrial valves division for Pounds 36m last April. In 1992 there was a
Pounds 1.1m exceptional charge relating to a provision against the value of
an associate undertaking.
Stripping out exceptional items left pre-tax profits up by 17 per cent to
Pounds 19.1m.
The disposal cut gearing from 70 per cent to 11 per cent and interest
payments fell from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 1.4m. In January, the group
completed a sale and leaseback of an industrial estate in Staffordshire and
eliminating borrowings.
Group sales fell to Pounds 186.9m (Pounds 196m) including Pounds 6.9m
(Pounds 23.5m) from discontinued activities. Continuing businesses grew by 4
per cent to Pounds 180m, while trading profits, excluding the industrial
valves division, rose by 20 per cent from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 19.5m.
In spite of competitive pressures on margins, the return on sales, excluding
discontinued businesses, rose from 9.4 to 10.8 per cent.
Mr David Abell, chairman, said: 'I expect to see a continuation of the
overall gradual but uneven improvement we have experienced in 1993.'
He added that no decision had been made regarding James Wilkes, the
Sheffield engineer in which Suter recently raised its stake to 29.5 per
cent. However, the chairman could not resist saying that the two groups
offered 'a fit as near perfect as you would get'.
Suter announced a further bonus issue of warrants of one for every 10
ordinary shares held. Mr Abell said terms would be structured so as not to
conflict with last year's warrant issue.
Earnings per share grew to 22.7p (8.7p) or 21p (8.6p) fully diluted.
Stripping out the exceptional, earnings rose by 18 per cent to 11.5p (9.7p)
or 11.3p (9.6p) fully diluted.
A recommended final dividend of 5.8p gives a total of 9.2p (8.8p), a rise of
4.5 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Thorntons surges 36% to Pounds 9.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer that has reorganised its
lossmaking French businesses, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.58m for
the 28 weeks ended January 8.
'This is well above anything else we have reported before', said Mr John
Thornton, chairman and chief executive, yesterday.
The 36 per cent rise from a previous Pounds 7.02m reflected the benefits
from last year's French reorganisation, which helped push the group Pounds
4.8m into the red at the year-end.
Mr Thornton said the rationalisation was almost complete. The French
business would be concentrated on 20 shops in Paris, with 20 outlets being
closed.
At the operating level the loss from French operations was cut to Pounds
93,000 for the half, compared with Pounds 846,000 last time. 'We are very
confident about the future', said Mr Thornton.
Total group turnover from continuing operations rose by almost 10 per cent
from Pounds 51.4m to Pounds 56.4m, not including Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.95m)
from discontinued operations.
In the UK sales were boosted by a strong Christmas period, which accounts
for 30 per cent of annual turnover. Like-for-like sales in Thorntons own
shops were 4.1 per cent ahead.
Total UK sales, which include turnover from franchise outlets, chilled
cabinets and 'own label' sales to multiples, rose by 10.5 per cent to Pounds
54.2m.
The group opened 46 new outlets in the period, comprising 10 Thorntons
shops, one franchise and 35 chilled cabinets sited in other shops.
Mr Thornton said the group had made general gains in the efficiency of its
distribution system, cutting waste. Overall capital expenditure was Pounds
5m, down from Pounds 8.5m.
Earnings per share rose from 7.38p to 9.82p. The interim dividend has been
raised to 1.45p (1.25p).

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trust launched to seek undervalued assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Value Management is launching an investment trust which aims to
seek out undervalued UK commercial and industrial companies.
The Undervalued Assets Trust is expected to raise Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m
through a placing and offer for subscription.
Companies will be selected through value management techniques, analysing
accounting data to find shares which stand at a significant discount to
their real worth.
'The UK market is not an efficient one. Exaggerated market sentiment can
colour perceptions of a company, clouding judgment on shares where there is
value to be found,' said Mr Colin McClean, managing director of Scottish
Value Management, who set up the company in 1990 after managing funds for
Scottish Provident, FS Assurance and Templeton.
The company already manages two listed investment trusts, both of which
invest in other investment trusts. It also has an insurance fund, SVM
Superior Growth, with an investment remit similar to the new trust. Launched
in October 1991, it was among the top ten performing funds (out of more than
600) last year.
Undervalued Assets Trust is issuing only ordinary shares, breaking the
current investment trust trend for all trusts, except those with a split
capital structure, to attach warrants to their ordinary shares.
The placing is due to close on March 31, and the public offer will run from
April 6 to April 20.

Fully-diluted net asset value per ordinary share of Sumit, the development
and venture capital investment trust, stood at 154p at the December 31 year
end. That compared with 103p at the half year stage and 95p 12 months
earlier.
The announcement yesterday of a proposed placing by Partico at 200p per
share will increase Sumit's fully-diluted figure to 186p. At the placing
price the trust's interest in Partico, including its holding of redeemable
preference shares, will be valued at Pounds 6.5m - a gain of Pounds 3m over
its December 1993 valuation.
Sumit has indicated its intention to sell a third of its holding in
Partico's ordinary equity at the placing price which will realise Pounds
1.7m.
Available revenue for 1993 improved from Pounds 161,000 to Pounds 303,000,
for earnings of 4.2p (2.2p). A final dividend of 2.3p, compared with a 1.3p
forecast, makes a 3p (1.4p) total.

Improved performance and the completion of several large contracts during
the year helped Instem, the USM-quoted information systems group, lift
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 to Pounds 1.02m.
This compares with Pounds 575,000 last time, when the figure was hit by an
exceptional Pounds 386,000 for bad debts.
Turnover was up from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 19.3m and earnings per share
came out ahead at 14.8p (8.5p).
A same-again final of 1.8p is recommended, to give a total maintained at

Sunleigh, the USM-quoted leisure products concern, broke even in the second
half of 1993 leaving annual pre-tax profits at Pounds 208,000, against
losses of Pounds 557,000.
The result was after taking a charge of Pounds 397,000 for the loss on sale
of discontinued activities, offset by a Pounds 250,000 release of
provisions. The previous year there was a net release of provisions of
Pounds 71,000.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 12.9m) of which Pounds
263,000 (Pounds 1.21m) related to discontinued activities. Earnings per

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Brent Intl pay-out cut after fall to Pounds
7.14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent International, the troubled speciality chemicals group whose chief
executive resigned in August, is cutting its dividend after pre-tax profits
slumped from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 7.14m in 1993.
Profits for the year to December 31 were struck after Pounds 289,000 of
compensation to former chief executive Mr Steve Cuthbert, who had a two and
a half year contract at a salary of Pounds 135,000.
Mr Keith Hutchings, the former finance director who has been acting chief
executive since his departure, said the scale of compensation reflected the
fact that Mr Cuthbert was over 50.
Exceptionals of Pounds 3.91m included Pounds 580,000 of costs relating to
acquisitions which were aborted early in the year when the scale of the
group's problems became clear.
Earnings per share dropped from 10p to just 3.2p. There was a reduced final
of 2.4p (5.8p) leaving a total of 4p (7.4p).
The profit figure includes gains of Pounds 6.76m on the disposal of
businesses.
Sales from continuing operations rose 5 per cent to Pounds 114m. Excluding
exceptionals, operating profits in the continuing businesses fell from
Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 6m.
The company said there had been some improvement in the UK and US but not in
continental Europe which accounts for 43 per cent of sales.
However, Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said, 'the lower cost base from
which we now operate should enable us to make further progress in 1994.'
Mr Hutchings was yesterday confirmed as chief executive, with Mr Bill
Jessup, former finance director of Beauford, the struggling engineering
group, replacing him as finance director. Lord Lane will retire next year
and be succeeded as chairman by Mr Alec Daly, who joined the board a year
ago.
The shares fell 15 1/2 p to 105p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels reveals loss of Pounds 71m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels yesterday released its long-awaited accounts for the year to
April 1993, revealing pre-tax losses of Pounds 71m and a negative net worth
of Pounds 22.7m.
The company is no longer able to cover its interest payments, and a number
of restructuring proposals are under consideration to enable the group to
survive.
Mr Robert Feld, the head of the family that built up the group, yesterday
resigned from the board. The other directors are expected to stand down at
the time of any restructuring, to facilitate inevitable management changes.
Resort Hotels shares have been suspended since July 16, when the company
first announced concerns over 'a number of financing and reporting issues'.
The hotel group had expanded aggressively in the previous two years, and it
admitted to difficulties over property valuations, which led to the lengthy
delay in releasing its accounts.
The company yesterday announced the extent of its difficulties. It wrote
down its properties by Pounds 40.5m to Pounds 64.4m and took a further
Pounds 11.5m charge on an inter-company loan to the Country Resorts group,
prior to its acquisition in 1993.
A further Pounds 8.5m provision has been made against amounts due from
management contracts with other troubled hotel owners.
In spite of an improving hotel market, the management said it was still
unable to cover its finance charges. Hotel Resorts suffered pre-tax losses,
before exceptional items, of Pounds 9.4m in the year ended April 1993, after
Pounds 4.7m in interest payments against its Pounds 53m bank debt.
Mr David Tonkinson, chairman, said the company was looking at a number of
options, which would result in a partial debt for equity swap and possibly a
merger with another hotel group.
The group's financial position has been improved by the Pounds 7.3m sale of
four hotels in February 1994, and the company said it believed 'the group's
lenders will be sympathetic to the implementation of a restructuring'.
Resort Hotels is believed to be in discussions with two other hotel groups,
but it is possible that it may consider a further rights issue.
Mr Tonkinson said: 'The main reason for our problems was the turbulence in
hotel property values and therefore the hardening of the attitudes of the
lenders.'
Resort Hotels was listed in March 1988, with a value of Pounds 6.7m. It
expanded rapidly through a string of rights issues and had a market
capitalisation of Pounds 46m at the time of its suspension.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Higher death rate helps Plantsbrook advance
33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A significant rise in the fourth-quarter death rate helped to boost 1993
pre-tax profits by almost 33 per cent at Plantsbrook Group, the funeral
services group.
They rose from Pounds 9.05m to a record Pounds 12m. Total turnover rose from
Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 52m, including a contribution of Pounds 800,000 from
acquisitions.
Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive, said the overall rise of 4 per cent in
the death rate for 1993 was to some extent owing to flu towards the end of
the year. He expected the rate to fall back this year.
The result was also helped by a reduction in net interest payable from
Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 586,000. This reflected lower rates; the repayment of
Pounds 3.3m of fixed rate hire purchase debt; a reduction in total
borrowings from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 7m; and the benefit of a Pounds 2m
private placing of 2.99m ordinary shares last June.
Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose from 7.03p to 7.77p. In
addition to the June placing, 25.9m shares were issued in October and
November following the conversion of the unlisted 1997 preference shares.
There are now 106.5m ordinary shares in issue.
The group made five acquisitions in the year, paying Pounds 2.4m, and has
opened seven new branches. So far this year it has acquired two more
businesses for Pounds 4.2m cash.
Further acquisitions were likely, said Mr Hindley. The group was also
looking at ways of returning to the crematorium market.
Dignity, the pre-paid funeral business had performed satisfactorily, said Mr
Hindley, generating Pounds 1.5m of turnover. An autumn advertising campaign
had resulted in a 42 per cent increase in sales in the second half.
Gearing at the end of the year was 28 per cent, compared with 54 per cent in
1992.
A final dividend of 2.3p (2p) is proposed, giving a total of 3.4p for the
year (3p).
COMMENT
While the unexpected rise in last year's mortality rate provided a boost to
profits, the achievements of the present management in restoring Plantsbrook
to a strongly cash generative business should not be overlooked. However,
profits this year are likely to remain static unless the death rate rises
again. The group's 9 per cent market share of funerals looks mature. It is
way behind market leader Great Southern in the pre-paid funeral business.
Tough new environmental legislation on crematoriums could lead to local
authority privatisation or operating contracts, but it would be expensive to
build new ones. At yesterday's close of 109p and a prospective p/e of 13.5p
the shares look a hold - but keep an eye on the deaths column.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders confirm QMH Pounds 2bn limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group in talks with its banks
over refinancing its Pounds 1.3bn of debt, yesterday confirmed the group's
borrowing limit of Pounds 2bn at two special meetings.
Some shareholders used the meeting to ask questions about indemnity
insurance for the company's directors.
Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman, refused to answer these questions saying they
were outside the scope of the meeting, but said it was normal for large
public companies to take out insurance covering directors against liability.
Mr John Bairstow, the group's former chairman, said later that when he was
in charge at QMH the group's indemnity cover of Pounds 10m cost Pounds
34,000 a year.
The premium is now reputed to be Pounds 700,000. This would reflect the
substantial change in the group's position with massive losses, the shares
suspended, a department of trade and industry investigation proceeding and
threats of litigation.
Mr Bairstow changed his vote at the meeting. In advance of the meeting he
had voted his 8m shares against the resolution by proxy but in the poll
taken at the meeting he voted in favour.
At the meetings Mr Metcalfe said the group's results for 1993, which will
incorporate a new property valuation, should be completed by the end of
April.
He said the restructuring talks were progressing, and the foundations for a
reconstruction were being laid.
He said he was sorry it was taking so long but there were a number of
complex issues involved.
He hoped that the shares, which were suspended in March last year, would be
relisted as soon as shareholders approved the restructuring.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wates City disappoints with Pounds 0.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wates City of London Properties, the development and investment group,
disappointed the stock market yesterday despite increasing optimism on City
office prices.
Even though the company announced a return to the black in the year ended
December 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 113,000 against a loss of Pounds
74.9m (after write-downs of Pounds 71.9m on property valuations last time),
the share price still fell 8 1/2 p to 87 1/2 p.
Disappointment focused on a further property provision of Pounds 2.7m in
1993, and on Wates' net asset value per share of 72.8p, an increase of only
0.4p.
However, Wates has substantially strengthened its balance sheet through a
rights issue and property disposals. Total borrowings fell by 38 per cent to
Pounds 56.2m.
There were reduced losses per share last year of 0.71p (59.26p).

</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR-Data Management, the data transcription and document image processing
group, reported lower interim pre-tax profits reflecting one-off
reorganisation costs, lower net interest income and development costs in its
Memex software division.
In the six months to December 31 profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 2.66m
(Pounds 4.02m) on turnover up 5 per cent to Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 18.6m).
Earnings per share declined to 3.21p (4.89p). However, the interim dividend
is being raised by 20 per cent to 2.076p (1.73p) reflecting the group's
strong balance sheet and cash position.
Mr John Redmond, chairman, said: 'During the past months we have reorganised
our business resulting in significant one-off costs which have been absorbed
in the first half. Additionally profits have been affected by the on-going
development costs at Memex.'
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.02m). The 1992 figure
was boosted, following accounting rule changes, by the writing back of
Pounds 651,000 of acquisition provisions. The 1993 figure was reduced by
reorganisation costs of Pounds 382,000.

disappointed the stock market yesterday despite increasing optimism on City

Even though the company announced a return to the black in the year ended
December 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 113,000 against a loss of Pounds
74.9m (after write-downs of Pounds 71.9m on property valuations last time)
the share price still fell 8 1/2 p to 87 1/2 p.
Disappointment focused on a further property provision of Pounds 2.7m in
1993, and on Wates' net asset value per share of 72.8p, an increase of only
0.4p.
However, 1993 was a turnround year for Wates, which entered the recession
with 27 per cent gearing but saw it peak at 102 per cent due to slashed
property valuations.
Last year, Wates substantially strengthened its balance sheet, through a
rights issue and property disposals.
Total borrowings fell by 38 per cent to Pounds 56.2m, and gearing fell from
102 per cent to 50 per cent.
Wates is proceeding with the site formation for a 57,400 sq ft office and
retail development in Queen's Street, although it is possible that the site
could be sold.
It will also demolish Winchester House during 1994, to make way for a
300,000 sq ft office development. The project is 60 per cent owned by
Friends Provident.
Wates is unable to renew a dividend payment, because of a substantial
deficit on the company's profit and loss account.
There were reduced losses per share of 0.71p (59.26p).
Mr James Dundas Hamilton has announced his retirement as non-executive
chairman. He will be replaced by Mr Paul Wates, the current chief executive.

development costs at Memex.
'However, we are operating in high growth markets and, in particular,
prospects for our software products and our laser printing and document
scanning service bureau are extremely good. We therefore remain optimistic
about the remainder of the year.'
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.02m) mainly reflecting
the development costs at Memex. The 1992 figure was boosted, following
accounting rule changes, by the writing back of Pounds 651,000 of
acquisition provisions. The 1993 figure was reduced by reorganisation costs
of Pounds 382,000.
Mr Redmond said the redundancy and reorganisation costs in the document
image processing division would result in annual savings of Pounds 710,000
and were necessary to reposition the business for growth.
In the core data transcription division the COM and laser printing bureau
services both increased production volumes, turnover and profit. Margins in
both businesses also improved.
Net interest receipts fell to Pounds 212,000 (Pounds 365,000) although the
group ended the year with cash balances of Pounds 9.57m, up by Pounds 2.69m
from June 30, partly reflecting the crystalisation of a Pounds 1.05m
exchange gain.

Partco Group, the biggest independent distributor of automotive parts and

intermediaries offer at 200p per share - valuing the whole company at Pounds
59.2m.
The placing and offer comprises 14.58m ordinary shares - 11m of which are
new ordinaries being issued by the company.
The remaining 3.58m shares are being sold by existing shareholders.
Partco, which was a management buy-out in 1986 from Quinton Hazell, trades
from more than 200 branches in the UK and had sales of about Pounds 124m in
1993.
Pre-tax profits last year were Pounds 4.28m, from which pro-forma earnings
on an actual tax basis were 13.2p a share. This gives an historic multiple
of 15.2 times at the 200p offer price.
The notional net dividend for 1993 was 5.35p, giving a gross yield of 3.3
per cent.
The group is being advised by Hambro Magan, with Cazenove acting as brokers
to the issue. The closing date for the intermediaries offer is March 15 and
dealings are expected to begin on March 18.
COMMENT
Improved distribution methods, long familiar in retailing and industry, are
transforming the previously fragmented business of supplying automotive
parts to garages. Last month Finelist, a smaller competitor to Partco, was
floated successfully. Now investors are offered an opportunity to back the
biggest group in the field, which has a national warehouse and sees scope
for rapid expansion. With forecast earnings of about 11.9p per share in the
current year, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 16.8, a discount
to Finelist, and a prospective yield of 3.5 per cent - a premium to the
smaller company. The pricing does not look aggressive and should leave the
larger group plenty to go for.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Claremont buys Magellan Inds - New group to
supply 11% of Marks and Spencer's clothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Claremont Garments, the clothing manufacturer, yesterday announced an agreed
Pounds 43.3m takeover of Magellan Industries, the lingerie and swimwear
company.
The takeover, bringing together two of Marks and Spencer's leading
suppliers, follows production problems at Magellan, which yesterday reported
increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.26m in the 12 months to December 31,
compared with Pounds 511,000.
Mr Chris Ryder, Magellan chief executive, said the acquisition by Claremont
was an attractive option after a year in which it failed to recruit enough
workers or ensure adequate raw material supplies to complete orders for
Marks and Spencer.
Under the all-paper offer, Claremont is issuing up to 12.8m new shares, some
23.9 per cent of the enlarged group, which are being offered to Magellan
shareholders on a 0.4816-for-1 basis.
The offer has already been accepted by Magellan directors and family trusts
associated with Mr Oliver Prenn, the chairman, which together control 36.1
per cent of the company.
Schroder Investment Management, Magellan's largest institutional
shareholder, has also agreed to procure acceptances on behalf of investors
holding a further 14.8 per cent.
Welcoming the undertakings, Mr Peter Wiegand, Claremont chairman, said: 'The
acquisition will strengthen our product range and our relationship with
Marks and Spencer.'
He claimed the group would supply up to 11 per cent of the retailer's total
clothing stock, which in turn would account for 95 per cent of its business.
Marks and Spencer welcomed the takeover and said it was happy with the
terms.
Claremont, meanwhile, announced a 36 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 8.5m) in the 12 months to December 25.
The improvement was spurred by full year contributions from two earlier
acquisitions - JJ Fashions and Alexander Milnes - which helped operating
profits increase by 32 per cent to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9m).
Turnover increased to Pounds 114.4m (Pounds 81.5m), while earnings per share
came out at 19.1p (16.4p) or 18.2p (16.2p) on a fully diluted basis.
By comparison, turnover at Magellan in 1993 was flat at Pounds 36.9m (Pounds
35.5m). Losses per share of were 4.7p (2p) or 2.7p (0.2p) excluding
exceptional items.
The group's results were hit not only by supply and staffing problems but
also by a Pounds 496,000 exceptional charge following the collapse last
August of Dunkeld, the shirt manufacturer. The charge arose out of losses on
Dunkeld shares which Magellan received in part payment for Slix, its
swimwear brand, sold in 1992 for Pounds 1.07m.
It plans an unchanged final dividend of 1.4p; while Claremont announced a
proposed final pay-out of 4.5p (3.95p), making 8.1p for the year (7.25p).
Claremont is also acquiring Bellrise Fashions, the Next supplier for Pounds
1.9m cash, funded from bank reserves of Pounds 6.6m.
Its shares rose 5p to 358p. Magellan's closed down 1p at 172p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore higher than forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore, the UK-based fund management company yesterday reported pre-tax
profits for 1993 of Pounds 24.6m, nearly Pounds 2m higher than forecast when
its shares were first offered to the public last November.
Banque Indosuez floated 25 per cent of its stake in Gartmore last November
in a sale that valued the company at about Pounds 338m.
Profits would have been Pounds 2.7m higher had it not been for non-recurring
items relating to the disposition of a loan and staff retention scheme set
in place when Banque Indosuez was the sole owner.
A year earlier it had a loss of Pounds 2.15m after Pounds 17.1m of
non-recurring charges relating mainly to a loan from Banque Indosuez.
Earnings were 8.7p a share against a loss of 1.8p. It plans to pay its first
post-flotation dividend at the half-year.
Gartmore's funds under management grew 64 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 21bn,
with net new money up Pounds 4.2bn. The remainder of the growth was
accounted for by market movements and investment returns.
Mr Paul Myners, executive chairman, said the rate of new business growth was
highly unusual for Gartmore or for the industry generally and is unlikely to
be repeated. 'We would discourage analysts and others from forecasting this
rate of growth,' he said.
Mr Myners said that to handle the influx of new cash, Gartmore had increased
its staff numbers by 36, mostly adding fund managers and client service
managers. Industry analysts have said that the greatest difficulty facing
Gartmore, now one of the so-called 'Big Four' UK pension fund managers, is
whether it can manage the rapid increase in funds under management without
damaging investment performance or client servicing capacity.
Mr David Watts, managing director of Gartmore's pension fund management
business, said that the growth in assets had made rapid execution of
portfolio shifts somewhat more difficult.
Gartmore has begun to ask its clients for permission to use derivatives to
gain access to markets quickly at lower execution costs.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Growth expected to continue at Hays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hays, the business service group, increased its pre-tax profits by 33 per
cent to Pounds 38.6m in the six months to December 31.
Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, said the distribution and personnel
core activities both increased profits by a substantial margin while
commercial activity saw profits increase more modestly.
He said: 'The improvement in profit is expected to continue in the second
half, although the percentage increase will be lower due to the stronger
performance in the comparable period last year.'
Hays said the trading environment of its UK businesses had slowly improved
since January, 1993, whilst the German and French economies remained in
recession.
In distribution, operating profits increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 23.4m.
Mr Frost said the chemical distribution profits were adversely affected by
over Pounds 1m as a result of the weakness in the world price of caustic
soda, although sales volumes had been well maintained.
He said: 'There was a particularly strong performance from packaged
chemicals which continued to increase both market share and margins, winning
a new contract with Shell for the distribution of solvents.'
In personnel, operating profits bounced back from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds
6.4m. Temporary placements were particularly buoyant and the number of
permanent placements had also started to increase, but at a slower rate.
Operating profits from commercial activities rose from Pounds 10.6m to
Pounds 11.7m. Britdoc, the group's overnight parcels business, had expanded.
However, profits from records management fell as demand shifted from space
managed by clients towards Hays fast access storage.
Earnings per share increased by 31 per cent to 6.4p (4.9p). The interim
dividend was lifted by 15 per cent to 1.95p (1.7p).
COMMENT
A share price unchanged at 309p seemed scant reward for announcing this sort
of profits increase. But on a day that the FTSE 100 fell 41.5 points, just
holding on to recent gains was no mean achievement. The results were in line
with expectations, although analysts were disappointed that the share of
profits coming from the group's highly regarded commercial activities fell
back from 35 to 28 per cent. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 85m put
the shares on a prospective multiple of 22, a 30 per cent premium to the
market. The shares have outperformed by 16 per cent over the past year, so
they certainly are not cheap at this level. However, Hays still has plenty
of recovery potential in both personnel and caustic soda distribution, even
if Mr Frost does not expect the chemical's price to firm much before the end
of 1994.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enviromed purchase and joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enviromed, the biotechnology group, yesterday announced a Pounds 9m
acquisition and joint venture plan aimed at expanding its distribution and
supply of research and healthcare products.
The company, which came to the market last year, said the expansion would be
dominated by the acquisition of Biozyme, the private laboratory group, for
Pounds 8.05m cash.
Mr Peter Townsend, chief executive, said Biozyme - which specialises in the
isolation and supply of enzymes for clinical laboratories and the
diagnostics industry - would complement its existing biochemical monitoring
business.
'It's a very exciting prospect for us - Biozyme's enzyme technology will
make an important contribution to our operations,' he added.
Enviromed has also agreed to form a European joint venture with Selfcare,
the US distributor of self-diagnosis and self-treatment products.
As part of the joint venture agreement, Enviromed is buying a 12.5 per cent
stake in the Massachussett's-based company for Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 1m).
The Biozyme acquisition and Selfcare share stake will be funded by a Pounds
9.8m placing and open offer of 8.63m new ordinary shares at 125p each.
Singer and Friedlander, which is handling the offer, said existing
shareholders would be offered new shares on a 3-for-5 basis.
Enviromed's directors, who currently hold 52.06 per cent of the shares, are
expected to retain 34 per cent once the placing and offer is completed.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey chief executive to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Wakeling is to quit as chief executive of Johnson Matthey, the
precious metals group, at the end of this month. He is expected to receive
compensation in the region of Pounds 330,000.
Mr Wakeling is not being replaced, but Mr David Davies, chairman, is to take
on the chief executive role as well. Mr Geoffrey Wilson, a non-executive
director, is becoming deputy chairman.
Mr Wakeling, 46, joined JM as a non-executive director in 1987, when he was
finance director of Charter Consolidated which held a 38.5 per cent stake in
JM. Charter sold its stake a year ago. He became deputy chief executive in
January 1990 and chief executive in January 1991. JM said it wished Mr
Wakeling well in his 'alternative career'.
JM said yesterday that Mr Wakeling's job had been to supervise the three
year reorganisation of the group and he had now completed his task. It had
been the consensus view of the board that his job was no longer necessary.
It said that operational management was strong and Mr Davies was a hands-on
executive chairman.
Further, the group had talked to its institutional shareholders about
combining the chairman and chief executive roles. The changes had been
approved by two non-executives representing the group's two largest
shareholders, Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Minorco, which hold
20 per cent between them bought from Charter.
Mr Chris Clark, executive director in charge of materials technology,
becomes managing director, materials technology, colour and print. Mr Graham
Titcombe, executive director, precious metals and catalytic systems, becomes
managing director with the same responsibilities.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Southern Newspapers surges to Pounds 7m
midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Southern Newspapers, the regional newspaper group, surged from
Pounds 3m to Pounds 7.15m pre-tax for the 26 weeks ended January 1. The
figure included a Pounds 3.5m profit from the sale of the group's
shareholding in Portsmouth  Sunderland Newspapers.
Turnover improved to Pounds 36.62m (Pounds 35.41m), generating operating
profits of Pounds 3.58m (Pounds 2.95m). The group had noted a 'slight
improvement' in trading conditions since July.
The main contributor to the improved trading performance was the newspaper
division, although the magazine contract printing division increased
turnover by a 'significant' amount.
Earnings emerged at 25.28p (8.88p) and the interim dividend is being lifted
to 3.5p (3p).
The directors said the acquisitions of the Stour Valley News, Monitor
Business Magazine and the seven titles of the west country-based Star
Newspaper Group had yet to make a real impact on the results.
They added that the benefit of rationalisation programmes in all cases
should be seen in the second half.
The half year pre-tax result virtually matched the Pounds 7.51m returned for
the previous full year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Taunton and Molson in US cider deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Americans used to the traditional autumnal tipple of apple cider may find
something rather more exotic on offer this year with the announcement
yesterday that Taunton Cider has clinched a distribution deal with the
specialist drinks importer, Molson USA.
Taunton is aiming at the up market drinker, including the 'working woman who
wants to stay in control'. She will be able to enjoy products such as Fres,
which is what Taunton calls a low alcohol product at just 4 per cent. Other
ciders to be introduced are Diamond White and Red Rock.
Taunton said yesterday it planned to introduce six of its brands in four
states from May through Molson's distribution network. After an initial
trial period, one or two brands would be chosen for sale throughout the US.
The group is moving into the US as trading in the UK appears to have become
increasingly difficult. Taunton also announced that competition from the
supermarket economy brands continued to affect trading. A substantial
marketing programme had been launched which would result in a lower average
selling price for the second half.
As a result, Taunton said sales and operating profits were expected to be
largely in line with last year's Pounds 129.9m and Pounds 19.7m
respectively. However, Mr Nick Pearch, finance director, said there was
likely to be some benefit at the pre-tax level from lower interest rates.
The US deal was not expected to show a return for some time. All proceeds
from the first year's shipment would be reinvested in marketing.
Mr Pearch said the US potential was enormous, with the beer market some five
times bigger than in the UK.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gibbs and Dandy back in the black with
Pounds 850,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reductions in costs and interest charges and a halving of bad debts helped
Gibbs and Dandy, builders merchants, turn in a profit for 1993 after three
years of losses.
The company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 852,000 for the year to December
31 against a loss of Pounds 124,000, helped by a cut in interest charges
from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds 136,000 and the reduction of bad debts to
Pounds 208,000.
Turnover for the year was 4.2 per cent ahead at Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 22.6m).
Earnings per share were 7.4p, against losses of 1.4p.
The return to profitability by the end of the first half gave the company
the confidence to pay its first dividend for more than three years, an
interim of 1p, and to anticipate a second interim of at least 1p.
This is now to be paid at 1.5p, with the payment as a second interim instead
of a final making earlier payment possible and giving a 2.5p total for the
year.

Burnfield incurred a loss in the second half and for the whole of 1993
suffered a profits fall from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 776,000 pre-tax.
The total dividend year is being cut to 2.5p (5.75p) via a reduced final of

taken would bring an early return to earnings and dividend growth. The
shares rose 5p to 77p.
Turnover rose from Pounds 29.82m to Pounds 38.53m. The West Midlands-based
group manufactures industrial controls and measurement equipment.
Restructuring costs of Pounds 1m at the Isopad and Budenberg offshoots were

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Accountants investigate Cupid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cupid, the beleaguered bridal wear manufacturer, is believed to have
commissioned a firm of accountants to investigate events leading to this
week's warning of substantial losses, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The group is also expected to announce the departure of Mr Richard Shaw,
chief executive, who earlier this week was suspended temporarily from his
duties.
Staff at Cupid's Lancashire offices said yesterday he had already left the
company.
It is believed that Mr Shaw, who was on a 12-month rolling contract, will
receive compensation of less than Pounds 100,000. He was brought into the
group at the request of shareholders following a profits warning in February
1993. His brief was to lead Cupid through a series of acquisitions. However,
this programme was never begun.
In January, the company announced interim losses of Pounds 456,000 and said
it was not clear whether it would return to profitability for the year. On
Monday, however, it became clear that the losses would be substantial after
provisions needed to restructure the bridal business.
Cupid is not expected to replace Mr Shaw. It is understood that his
responsibilities will be shared by Mr Stephen Riley, the finance director,
and Mr Robert Devlin, managing director of the Pronuptia/Youngs business.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Evode enhances Laporte's earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, ended a three-year decline in
earnings per share in 1993 helped by last February's acquisition of Evode,
the adhesives and plastics manufacturer.
At the time the City had been sceptical of Laporte's insistence that Evode
would enhance earnings. But Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said that all
Evode's businesses had performed extremely well and that the acquisition had
more than met the commitment made to shareholders.
Evode, which cost Pounds 228m including debt, made an 11-month contribution
with operating profits of Pounds 27.6m on sales of Pounds 250m. That helped
group pre-tax profit advance 24 per cent to Pounds 107m (Pounds 86.6m).
Group turnover jumped 47 per cent to Pounds 893m (Pounds 608m) including
associates of Pounds 16m (Pounds 86m). Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to
41.4p (39.2p). The dividend is also increased by 6 per cent with a proposed
final of 13.3p taking the total to 20.7p (19.5p).
Mr Minton said that excluding acquisitions and favourable exchange rate
movements pre-tax profits would have been 'just slightly ahead'.
The level of provisions against Evode, which surprised analysts when first
announced at the interim stage, has edged up Pounds 1m to Pounds 25.9m.
Mr Minton said Evode's margins had more than doubled to 11 per cent and that
there had been no benefit from written down stocks.
Profits were struck after sharply higher depreciation of Pounds 27.2m
(Pounds 17.8m) following several years of heavy capital investment. Capital
expenditure fell from Pounds 74.1m to Pounds 48.8m and there was a cash
inflow from operations of Pounds 21.8m, compared with an outflow of Pounds
81.2m in 1992.
After peaking at Pounds 190m immediately after the Evode acquisition
borrowings ended the year at Pounds 135m (Pounds 126m) for gearing of 44 per
cent. Mr Minton said there would be further disposals this year with the
proceeds 'redeployed in capital expenditure and add-on acquisitions'.
The shares fell 20p to 794p.
COMMENT
The City seems to have regained its faith in Laporte after two years of
doubt. Although earnings per share in 1993 were more than a tenth lower than
the 46.7p recorded in 1989 supporters point to Laporte's achievements over
the period, not least the exit from the Interox joint venture which left it
a pure speciality chemicals company. The Evode deal shows once again it can
make the acquisition numbers add up and the company can still blame market
conditions for the lack of underlying growth. But that will have to change
soon if its regained premium rating is to be sustained. Assuming profits of
Pounds 120m this year, for earnings of about 45p, the multiple is now almost
18.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ingredient for success pays off as Kerry
achieves IPounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in its food ingredients division, supported by a strong
dollar, helped Kerry Group, the Irish food manufacturer, lift pre-tax
profits by 22 per cent to IPounds 35m (Pounds 34m) for the year ended
December 31.
Turnover grew from IPounds 827m to IPounds 880m. Food ingredients now
comprise 40 per cent of turnover, having grown by a fifth in 1993. The meat
division contracted slightly while the dairy activities grew only modestly.
No divisional breakdown of profits was given but the company said margins
had improved across the group.
The tax charge rose from 11.4 per cent to 17 per cent, reflecting the
group's broader geographic spread - especially into the North American
market.
Kerry now has six food ingredient plants in the US, two in Canada and,
following an acquisition in December, one in Mexico. The latter is expected
to boost group turnover by a further IPounds 70m within the next two to
three years.
Further acquisitions in this sector are being considered in both North and
South America as well as in Europe.
Capital expenditure more than doubled during the year to IPounds 41.7m,
while a further IPounds 17m was spent on acquisitions.
Borrowings increased by IPounds 38m to IPounds 142m, giving a gearing of 56
per cent.
Interest charges were cut to IPounds 10.99m (IPounds 13.89m) largely as a
result of the group's placing of Dollars 155m (Pounds 106m) in loan notes
with US investors last September at what were described as 'historically low
interest rates'.
Earnings per share advanced to 18.5p (15.8p) and a final dividend of 1.69p
makes a 2.6p (2.26p) total.
COMMENT
The strategic expansion of Kerry's food ingredients division in the US,
Canada and Mexico has been clearly justified given the increasingly
significant contribution of these investments to the bottom line, even if
the company is paying top prices for its acquisitions. What is not so clear
is whether the group's earlier diversification into the
intensely-competitive and low margin red meat processing business was as
well considered or planned - although it has successfully built up a strong
customer base through multiple retail outlets in the UK and Europe and seems
prepared to operate at tighter margins than some of its main competitors.
Continued growth will come through the food ingredients and convenience
meats divisions and pre-tax profits of IPounds 39m seem likely for 1994,
giving earnings of 20p and a prospective p/e of 16.8. As the blue chip of
Irish food stocks this looks sustainable, but don't expect it to outshine
the market as much as it has in the past.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barings leaps to Pounds 100m helped by
securities side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings, the closely held UK-based investment bank, reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 100m for 1993, a dramatic improvement over 1992 when they halved
to Pounds 21.3m from the year before.
The group, whose share capital is owned by a charity established by the
Barings family, did not provide details of which activities had contributed
most to profits. But Mr Andrew Tuckey, Barings deputy chairman, said that
Baring Securities, which had experienced significant losses on Japanese
equities in 1992, had recovered strongly in 1993.
He also said that the Group had benefited from the enormous surge in
interest in investing in emerging markets. Among Baring's core businesses is
its role as an agency stockbroker and trader of emerging markets securities
with offices in 23 countries.
However, emerging markets have fallen somewhat since the start of the
current year and Mr Peter Baring, chairman, warned that the improvement in
the group's profitability was unlikely to continue at the same pace in 1994.
'During 1993, a number of factors working in our favour helped us produce
significantly improved profitability. While it is unlikely they will persist
during 1994, the year has started well and I believe we will face no
shortage of opportunity,' he said.
Barings said that its income from trading activity grew sharply from Pounds
65.3m to Pounds 149m while fees and commissions rose from Pounds 272m to
Pounds 377m.
Operating expenses also rose sharply to Pounds 469m aginst Pounds 349m. Mr
Tuckey said that worldwide, Barings has increased its staff by about 10 per
cent but the need to increase bonuses had also contributed to the sharp rise
in costs.
Mr Baring said: 'It is imperative for us to remunerate competitively if we
are to attract and retain good people; this is especially the case for a
group like Barings which is operating internationally, often in direct
competition with US-owned houses.'
A reorganisation which integrated the Baring Securities and Baring Brothers
and Co arms of the business into a new investment banking group is paying
off, Mr Tuckey said. The costs of that reorganisation, due to be completed
this year, were absorbed in the 1993 accounts.
Also contributing to profits were the activities of US investment bank
Dillon Read in which Barings has a 40 per cent stake. Mr Tuckey said the
bank, which specialises in US corporate finance and municipal bond
underwriting and trading, had had its most profitable year ever in 1993.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ADT net income little changed at Dollars
111.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group which does much
of its business in the US but retains a UK quote, yesterday reported net
income of Dollars 111.7m (Pounds 76.5m) for 1993.
The result was little changed from the Dollars 109.1m recorded in 1992, the
first year that the Bermuda-registered group reported under US GAAP rules.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 80 cents despite a higher Dollars 21.2m
(Dollars 6.8m) tax charge and the issue of 20.7m new shares as part of the
Dollars 1.25bn refinancing package completed in August.
Operating income after goodwill amortisation of Dollars 26.5m (Dollars
27.9m) increased by 8.5 per cent to Dollars 197.4m (Dollars 181.9m) on net
sales of Dollars 1.38bn (Dollars 1.35bn) led by the electronic security
services business which lifted its profit contribution to Dollars 154m
(Dollars 141m) on sales of Dollars 937.3m (Dollars 901.1m).
Commenting on the results, Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief
executive, said they were 'on target with the electronic security services
division successfully adding 145,000 new residential customers during the
year and the vehicle auction division having continued success in
encouraging new and used vehicle dealers to attend the company's auctions on
a regular basis.'
Net interest costs increased to Dollars 47.3m (Dollars 42.7m) mainly
reflecting a decline in interest income.
Mr Ashcroft said the refinancing, which lengthened ADT's average debt
maturities to over seven years, provided 'a firm base for the continued
development of the businesses.'
COMMENT
ADT's two core businesses continue to perform solidly if not spectacularly
with net cash flow from operations increasing to Dollars 271.4m (Dollars
221.9m) last year. ADT's residential security operations continue to benefit
from growing concern about crime on both sides of the Atlantic while the car
auctions business should benefit from the revitalised new car market. The
group has been investing heavily to cut costs and the few remaining non-core
operations are slated for sale. Offsetting these positives are the higher
interest costs associated with the debt refinancing and the continued
increase in ADT's reported tax rate, which will leave earnings virtually
unchanged this year. ADT's shares continue to underperform the market,
reflecting investors' concerns about the group's chequered history.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Jardine may have to delist from HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The attempt by the Jardine group of companies to bypass Hong Kong's takeover
laws and remain listed on the colony's stock exchange appeared untenable
yesterday, with regulators apparently unprepared to revoke their opposition
to the company's plans.
It is understood that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the
colony's corporate watchdog, will not approve the company's proposed scheme
whereby Bermudan takeover law especially enacted for Jardine supersedes Hong
Kong rules.
This scheme has been the subject of negotiation between Jardine and the SFC
since the beginning of this year. A failure of the two to agree raises the
possibility that the Jardine group might delist its shares in Hong Kong.
Jardine precipitated a flight of capital from Hong Kong in 1984 when it
announced it would move its company registration to Bermuda. The company
does not believe that Hong Kong's legal framework will provide sufficient
protection after China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
The Chinese government has frequently attacked Jardine because of its stated
support for Governor Chris Patten's democracy plans, and its alleged
involvement in the removal of Mr Patten's predecessor.
Last May, Jardine said Bermuda had agreed to enact laws to bring the Jardine
group under a statutory version of London's Takeover Code. The code will be
administered by Bermuda's Monetary Authority.
However the SFC is concerned about the credibility of such legislation,
created at the behest of one company. It claims the takeover code in Bermuda
applies to one company in Bermuda - Jardine - and it believes that companies
operating in Hong Kong should abide by Hong Kong rules.
The Jardine group comprises Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic, Mandarin
Oriental, Hongkong Land, and Dairy Farm. Their combined market
capitalisation accounts for about 9.7 per cent of the Hong Kong stock
market.
Mr Nigel Rich, the company's managing director, steps down this month to
return to the UK. His place will be taken by Mr Alasdair Morrison, the
45-year-old boss of a Jardine associate.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The hazards of bringing home the harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Distance lends enchantment to the view - at least, it does when there is a
bull market and the money is flowing freely. Last year the further-flung
securities markets tended to outperform handsomely. In 1994 so far, however,
it has paid to stay closer to home.
That is the viewpoint of the US investor, anyway. Supposedly the recent
shakeout in the global securities markets has been all about a quarter-point
rise in short-term US interest rates signalled on February 4 (admittedly
with the hint that there is a good deal more tightening to come). The
paradox is that although short-term rates have risen nowhere else (and have
fallen in several European countries), the damage to the markets has
generally been worse outside the US.
While the US equity market has only retreated about 3 per cent - as measured
by the FT-Actuaries World Index series - the UK index has fallen by twice as
much, while Mexico is off 11 per cent and Hong Kong by 15 per cent. Only
Tokyo has managed to show some slight appreciation.
As for bond markets, the ten-year US Treasury bond yield may have shown a
sharp upward move of some 56 basis points, but once again things have proved
to be tougher elsewhere, with sentiment in Europe taking another turn for
the worse late yesterday. Returns in the UK have risen by more like 60 basis
points, and the yield on Spanish ten-year government bonds is up by a full
percentage point. Interestingly, Japan has fallen in line as far as bonds
are concerned, with a sharp back-up in yields (the ten-year yield is up more
than 100 basis points since early January).
The Latin American debt markets, so fashionable and lucrative last year,
when the Brady Bond index was up 44 per cent, have taken a tumble. There are
rumblings of further trouble connected with Banco Latino, the failed
Venezuelan bank.
All this presumably says something about the speculative positions that were
built up during the 1993 bull market, as well as the relatively poor
liquidity of some of the smaller national securities markets. The stop loss
selling of hedge funds and investment banks has created more damage in the
minor markets.
The central banks this week decided that the hedge funds were not big enough
to pose any systemic risks. Nevertheless, the changing global patterns
should be watched closely. Volatility is clearly being exported from the US
through cross-border investment. Last year the US equity market varied by
less than 5 per cent either side of the mid-point, much the same pattern as
in 1992. The action shifted with a vengeance to more exotic locations.
When big money is moving in, the risks of investment are clearly seen to be
less, and the riskiest markets show the highest returns through a process of
progression towards the mean. It becomes attractive to chase the
highest-yielding paper and there is a convergence of returns: curiously, the
government paper of European Union member states showed narrower yield
differentials after the effective collapse of the exchange rate mechanism
than before.
When the money moves out, however, the marginal markets tend to be sold
first, as the pricing of perceived risk tends to rise - so that Spanish
bonds, for instance, are hit harder. Or, you could say, the fattest profits
are likely to be cashed in first.
The global investment themes have not been terminated, however, but are more
subdued. We have seen the exit of the hedge funds, which were front running
the pension funds and mutual funds. The US pension funds will probably act
as a stabilising force, seeing higher income returns as attractive.
But the third big group of players, the US mutual funds, may be another
matter. The boom in net receipts continued through to January, at about
Dollars 30bn for bond and equity funds combined, but the February intake may
have been more problematical. The danger arises from the way that mutual
fund investors have been chasing short-term gains, almost as eagerly as the
hedge fund managers. Already the sharp sell-off in Hong Kong and elsewhere
in south east Asia will have inflicted damage and prompted profit-taking.
Global investment can be exciting, but home is where the heart is.

FT  09 MAR 94 / WPP to reduce debt by sale of minority interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the marketing services group, yesterday announced it is likely to float
part of its market research businesses this year, yielding up to Dollars
200m (Pounds 137m), as part of its efforts to cut debt.
The announcement came as the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 54.4m
for the year ended December 31, 1993, up sharply from Pounds 7.8m in 1992.
The latest pre-tax profit figure is after charging a loss of Pounds 10.9m on
the sale of companies, against Pounds 28.9m of exceptional items a year
earlier .
A final dividend of 0.65p will make a total payout of 1p per share for 1993
 -the first year a dividend will have been paid since 1990. Fully diluted
earnings per share were 3.4p. The shares rose 2p to close at 125p.
Operating profit for the group - which includes advertising agencies J
Walter Thompson, and Ogilvy and Mather - was up 34 per cent to Pounds 95m,
while operating margins increased from 5.6 per cent to 6.7 per cent.
Billings rose 12 per cent to Pounds 6bn and revenues rose 12 per cent to
Pounds 1.4bn.
Forecasts from the group were cautious yesterday. It announced that 1994
budgets were based on a 1.5 per cent improvement in revenues and, despite an
improvement in confidence in North America and Europe, any recovery was
'still unstable and uncertain'. Tough controls would continue to ensure
'that the group is well placed when real (as opposed to that in the
financial markets) recovery comes'.
Some analysts were surprised by the subdued tone of the statement. Ms Lorna
Tilbian at Warburgs said the results reflected a recovery: 'You don't grow
revenues and increase operating profits so sharply just by management
efforts. You need an underlying recovery and this is evident in the figures.
I just think they're too frightened to say so.' Analysts' forecasts for 1994
pre-tax profits are now about Pounds 85m-Pounds 90m, with some revising
their forecasts slightly downwards.
The flotation of up to 50 per cent of the market research businesses on
either the US or UK stock markets could yield up to Dollars 200m, said the
group. Market research revenues in 1993 were Dollars 320m and operating
profits were Dollars 29m. The companies are based in the US, UK, Australia
and Japan.
If the minority stake were sold for the expected sum, average net
indebtedness could be reduced to Pounds 200m from the 1993 figure of Pounds
339m, said WPP. At the year end, net debt totalled Pounds 84m, down from
Pounds 240m - a sharper reduction than some had expected. The board said
indebtedness and net interest payments were 'manageable' but it continued
'to explore possible asset disposals and other opportunities to improve the
group's capital structure, although on a less pressurised basis'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Fisons plans cuts as profit tumbles: Drugs side to shed
1,000 jobs - 30% of scientific instruments division to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals group which dismissed its chief executive in
December, yesterday said it had identified further scope for cost cutting as
it unveiled a slump in trading profit from Pounds 117m to Pounds 37.4m.
Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, said its cost reduction programme would cut
overheads by an annualised Pounds 38m over two years, compared with the
previous forecast of Pounds 35m.
The programme, which will involve the loss of 1,000 jobs in the
pharmaceuticals division, follows a review by accountants Coopers  Lybrand
which cost Pounds 4m.
Mr Egan also revealed the group planned to sell about 30 per cent of its
scientific instruments division, which incurred losses of Pounds 39.6m,
including a restructuring charge of Pounds 20.7m.
In December, Fisons sacked its chief executive, Mr Cedric Scroggs, who had
been directly responsible for the scientific instruments division, and
warned the group would only break even for 1993. The company hopes to
announce a replacement for Mr Scroggs in the next few months. 'We are
absolutely determined to get it right and I am not going to be rushed,' said
Mr Egan.
The figures were also hit by the decision to end the practice of boosting
pharmaceutical sales just before the year-end by offering discounts. This
reduced profits in 1993 by Pounds 32m though Mr Mike Redmond,
pharmaceuticals managing director, stressed: 'We will be selling in January
and February what we would have sold in December.'
After Pounds 40m of exceptional items, trading profit from pharmaceuticals
fell Pounds 29.2m to Pounds 42.2m, with sales from continuing businesses up
7 per cent to Pounds 446m, while profits from laboratory supplies rose from
Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 27.6m.
At the pre-tax line, profits fell from Pounds 124m to just Pounds 1m after
losses on business to be discontinued of Pounds 32.9m. There was a loss per
share of 3.3p, compared with earnings of 13.9p.
Spending on research and development rose from Pounds 64.5m to Pounds 72.5m.
Thanks to disposals, an operating cash outflow of Pounds 69m after tax and
dividends became a cash inflow of Pounds 152m and gearing fell from 67 per
cent to 40 per cent. In line with December's announcement, the final
dividend is cut from 5.4p to 1.0p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Big losses forecast by Japanese steel groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's five big steelmakers yesterday announced they expect to incur losses
for the year ending this month and with the exception of Nippon Steel, will
be passing their dividend.
The severity of Japan's prolonged economic downturn coupled with the impact
of a high yen will result in a combined pre-tax loss for the industry of
Y114bn (Pounds 726m), even after sales of a substantial amount of
securities, the steel companies said.
Sumitomo Metal Industries, the third-largest integrated steelmaker, is
forecasting the largest loss among the five of Y34bn despite sales of stocks
amounting to Y16bn. It made a profit of Y5.3bn last year.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is planning to sell a total of
about Y66bn of securities holdings but nevertheless expects a loss of Y19bn,
compared with profits of Y28.9bn in 1992-93.
For Japan's steel industry, this year's results will be some of the worst
figures since the economy suffered the severe impact of the yen's rapid rise
in 1986.
'The trading environment has become extremely difficult,' said Mr Shigeru
Omori, executive vice president of Nippon Steel.
The steelmakers are accelerating restructuring plans, with many announcing
increased cuts in employees, reduced capital expenditure and stringent
reviews of operations. However, personnel reductions will generally be
achieved through natural wastage and transfers to subsidiaries. Some
diversification plans, which were begun as an attempt to reduce dependence
on steel products, are being scaled back or terminated altogether.
Sumitomo Metal, which is shedding 4,300 jobs over the next two years, plans
to reduce general capital spending by half to Y120bn although it will go
ahead with plans to invest Y90bn at its Wakayama plant. Sumitomo also plans
to reduce costs by 15 per cent, or Y150bn by 1995.
However, the decision to pass the dividend reflects general gloom about the
outlook for next year. The domestic situation is unlikely to recover much
and some steel groups expect a further deterioration in results.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Brussels warns German ban on UK beef would be 'illegal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission warned yesterday that Germany would be breaking
European law if it banned imports of British beef because of fears of 'mad
cow' disease.
Commission officials said any move by Germany, which has threatened a ban
because of its concern over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), would
almost certainly be met by legal action from the Commission. This would
probably mean an injunction in the European Court of Justice aimed at
forcing the ban to be lifted.
Health ministry officials in Bonn said yesterday that Germany intended to
seek a special session of EU health ministers later this month to discuss a
ban. Bonn has yet to state clearly that it is still prepared to impose
restrictions unilaterally if it fails to persuade its EU partners to impose
a Union-wide ban. Health ministry officials said last week Germany was
prepared to act unilaterally. In Brussels the Commission said: 'There is
only one body that can take a decision to restrict exports in Europe and
that is the Community.'
It added that the Commission had repeatedly told the Germans there was no
scientific evidence to link British beef with another spongiform infection,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
The warning came as German and British veterinary and health experts met in
Brussels to try to resolve the dispute, inflamed by recent comments from Mr
Horst Seehofer, German health minister, suggesting Germany would restrict
beef imports if the UK did not introduce tighter measures.
Government spokesmen in Bonn and London said there were differences in the
interpretation of scientific evidence. Mr Hartmut Schlegel, at the German
health ministry, said that this meant the Germans still wanted to press
ahead with restrictions.
Mr Rene Steichen, EU agricultural commissioner, has indicated to the German
government that any restrictions would be illegal.
The issue has provoked irritation in Brussels, not least because of its
implications for the Commission's powers and the operation of the single
European market.
A European Commission official said yesterday that Mr Steichen's attitude
was 'if the meat is safe enough for the UK consumer - and we are convinced
that it is - then it is safe enough for the German consumer too'.
Any ban on British beef, the official added, could have broader consequences
for exports of beef, both from the UK and from the EU as a whole.
German suggestions that the EU should take further EU-wide measures against
BSE were unnecessary, the official insisted. EU standards included the
slaughter and destruction of offal of infected cattle, and a ban on exports
from any herd found carrying the disease.

FT  09 MAR 94 / US urges truce to create jobs: Washington says no country
has found 'right approach' to labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Washington is calling for a US-European truce to the conflict over which
country has the right policies for creating jobs.
The US should invest more in education and training, while European
countries reform inflexible labour policies and wage-setting restrictions.
This is the central argument of a paper, mainly written by Mr Robert Reich,
the US labour secretary, circulated to Group of Seven governments before
next week's jobs summit in Detroit.
Although the UK government claimed yesterday its deregulatory approach
should be a model for other countries, the US paper says 'no country has yet
found the right approach to adjusting and succeeding in the new world
economy'.
It also emphasises that labour market reform is not a substitute for
creating economic demand. 'Countries that pursue structural improvements
without taking steps to increase aggregate demand will see little or no
return for their efforts.'
This reflects continuing US irritation with the refusal of other G7
countries to adopt more expansionary policies. The paper says a typical
developed country with an annual gain in productivity of 1.5 per cent and
labour force expansion of 0.5 per cent must have economic growth at a real
rate of more than 2 per cent a year just to hold unemployment constant.
It says that over the past two decades Europe has experienced substantial
real wage growth but stagnant employment. In contrast America has
experienced buoyant private sector employment but with growing wage
differentials and declining real pay for less-educated workers.
It adds that the main labour market problem in G7 countries is a shift in
demand from less-educated workers towards workers with problem-solving
skills. But compared with changes in technology, it argues that expanding
trade with lower-cost countries has had only a modest role in this shift.
'Increased globalisation and technological change have raised the knowledge
content of goods in which G7 nations have a comparative advantage. If
properly managed this shift in demand can lead to rapidly growing economies
that produce high-wage, high-skill jobs.'
The paper concludes: 'All G7 countries need to think about improvements in
policies to facilitate transitions from school to work, work to work, and
unemployment to work. All G7 countries need to maintain a commitment to an
open world trading system, but competition should be based on investments in
quality and innovation with workers viewed as assets to be invested in and
not just costs to be minimised'.
Some in the US have argued their country has little to learn about
employment policy from Europe, with its higher unemployment rates, but the
Clinton administration believes it can benefit from European lessons.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Norway nears accord on EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway was close last night to agreeing entry terms to the European Union,
joining Sweden, Finland and Austria, which concluded membership negotiations
last week.
But the planned move from 12 to 16 member states by January 1995 was stalled
because the UK and Spain - with lukewarm support from Italy - continued to
refuse to countenance any dilution of their voting rights in an expanded
Union.
At a closed meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the nine other current
EU members warned London and Madrid that the enlargement could not go ahead
if they remained obdurate. The Greek presidency of the EU and the European
Commission held bilateral meetings with the British and Spanish foreign
ministers, who were urged to contact their prime ministers, senior EU
diplomats said.
The UK and Spain insist on retaining the existing formula of 23 votes needed
to prevent EU legislation - out of 76 votes distributed among the 12 roughly
according to their size. Their partners want to shift the 'blocking
minority' to 27 votes, to maintain the same percentage in a Europe of 16
sharing 90 votes.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, proposed a compromise of moving to
27, plus a committee of representatives of EU heads of government to study
vote distribution before the Union's constitutional review in 1996. The
committee would be mandated to consider British, Spanish, Italian, and
German wishes to get a closer relation between national population and votes
than now exists.
A senior British official said: 'I can assure you there will be no
settlement except on British terms.' Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign
minister, said: 'If there is no solution to this problem, we will not
unfortunately be able to celebrate what we all want, enlargement.'
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany - which does worst in the new
vote share-out it is advocating in order to get the four applicants into the
Union - said: 'There is no sense in agreeing on 23 (votes) because this will
be rejected by the (European) parliament.'
Amid this test of negotiating nerve, the EU and Norway looked close to
squaring the other enlargement circle - Spanish insistence on recovering
'historic rights' to 7,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod against Oslo's refusal to
concede a single extra fish.
A Commission formula, which both Madrid and Oslo were prepared to consider,
in effect recycles fish quotas Norway conceded when it joined the European
Economic Area free trade zone, which started this year.
That allowed 7,250 tonnes of fish in 1994, rising to 11,000 tonnes in 1997,
for the EU's four poorest countries, nearly half of it earmarked for Spain.
Under the EEA, the Union also gets 2.9 per cent of the Norwegian waters cod
quota - about 40,000 tonnes this year. Norway's much-vaunted fisheries
management foresees rises in the quota, however, and therefore a higher
tonnage for the Union. The Commission proposes that that increment should go
to satisfy Spanish demands.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP may have lost ordinary shareholders a bundle of money by paying too much
for advertising businesses at the wrong time in the cycle. WPP's bankers,
though, are likely to be a cheerier bunch after cashing in their convertible
shares this year. The bounce in WPP's shares since its refinancing should
enable them to make a tidy turn on the shareholding acquired at the time of
the debt-for-equity swap. Martin Sorrell may join Rupert Murdoch as a
bankers' pin-up boy.
J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy  Mather are performing soundly. Revenue growth
of 4 per cent in constant currency terms stacks up well against comparable
agencies. Group operating margins have also improved from 6.9 per cent to
7.6 per cent before severance payments, yet staff costs remain high in
comparison with those of rivals such as Omnicom. That suggests WPP could
well attain its 10 per cent margin target even though the going gets tougher
from here. WPP's bizarre balance sheet should also regain greater normality
if the company succeeds in floating its market research business. Likely
proceeds of Dollars 200m would certainly make a useful dent in average debt
of Pounds 339m.
The market seems to have forgiven all WPP's past sins and is discounting
much of its future promise, too. WPP's shares again stand on a fancy
premium, which may be fair given its margin recovery and prospects for
advertising growth. Still, WPP's caution about the strength of recovery and
the forthcoming share conversion may dull the immediate shine.

<TEXT>
Wolff Olins, the identity consultants, have expensively concluded that
orange is distinctive, dynamic, open and positive. It is also, apparently,
simple, friendly and approachable. Most people, however, still think of it
as fruit. Hutchison Telecom's new mobile phone system, Orange, is thus open
to the crack that it is a lemon - particularly since Orange comes from the
company which produced the dead Rabbit network.
The name is doubly unfortunate because the Orange network looks attractive.
Since it will cover the main UK metropolitan areas and the connecting
motorways at launch, it has a significant advantage over its rival, Mercury
One-2-One. Its expansion will also be more rapid. Orange will cover 70 per
cent of the population by the end of the year and 90 per cent by mid-1995.
One-2-One will cover only around 30 per cent of the population by the year
end.
The pricing of calls and handsets, yet to be announced, will put pressure on
margins in the rest of the mobile phone industry. Coverage is wide enough to
make Orange a realistic alternative to Vodafone and Cellnet. They have been
picking up low-use domestic customers, but the old networks' profitability
is critically dependent on their business tariffs. Those fat margins could
be undermined if business users drift to Orange in significant numbers. Wide
coverage and lower handset prices are also a threat to One-2-One. It may
suffer for its decision to constrain capital spending and roll its network
out slowly.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was something of an achievement for Fisons to deliver yesterday's full
year results without any more nasty surprises. Pharmaceuticals sales growth
of 7 per cent is respectable enough, while the condition of the scientific
instruments division - the cause of December's profits warning - is not
deteriorating. If that record can be maintained, Fisons may finally deserve
to be judged squarely on its recovery prospects. A combination of modest
sales growth, cost savings and loss elimination could, after all, deliver
decent earnings growth.
There are still risks. Drug sales rest on two asthma treatments - Intal and
Tilade - for which the outlook is difficult to judge. Intal faces
competition from cheap generic alternatives. Tilade's US launch seems to be
going well enough, but it is too early to draw firm conclusions.
Disappointment from either drug would undermine any profits recovery. Even
assuming both products perform admirably, Fisons' research pipeline remains
worryingly empty. Licensing potential products from outside companies could
help solve that problem. Since Fisons has a mixed record in development and
lacks a chief executive, though, the omens for such deal-making are not
auspicious. Failure to secure a full raft of promising development projects
would make the marriage of cash-generative laboratory supplies, instruments
and pharmaceuticals difficult to justify. Unless the pipeline can be filled
in short order, breaking Fisons up and finding a partner in pharmaceuticals
may still be the best way of unlocking value.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two worries hit UK equities yesterday. One was the possibility that
January's strong industrial production figures might deter the authorities
from cutting interest rates again; the other was that some large rights
issues were in prospect. If true, the latter would indeed be cause for
concern. There is limited new cash going into the market at present. Any
that is steered towards equities is meeting a plentiful supply of new
issues. Yesterday's 41 point fall is thus partly a measure of how the equity
market, like gilts, has become prey to fears of over-supply.
By contrast interest rate worries look overdone, at least on the basis of
the output figures. These showed output of investment goods rose nearly 4
per cent in January while that of consumer goods fell slightly. That hardly
represents a trend, and investment goods output may simply have been
snapping back after two weak months in November and December. But at least
the picture is consistent with a shift towards investment-led growth that is
needed to make the recovery sustainable.
That should not stand in the way of interest rate cuts. Political pressures
for lower rates are likely to intensify as next month's tax increases bite.
Paradoxically, stronger output figures might even help by signalling rising
productivity. The UK's actual inflation performance is what really counts
for interest rates. The chancellor's life will be harder, though, if gilts
and sterling weaken further because of Germany's reluctance to accelerate
its own rate cuts.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Leading Article: How Europe can compete
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union plc is not engaged in a zero-sum struggle for economic
survival with the US, Japan, or even China Inc. On the contrary, peaceful
economic relations with other economies offer opportunities for mutual
enrichment. The question is whether Europe can take advantage of those
opportunities. Only thus can it hope to offer a steadily rising standard of
living to all Europeans.
The EU has much upon which to build. Its member states possess only 6 1/2
per cent of world population, but generate 25 per cent of global economic
output at market exchange rates, and 18 per cent even at purchasing power
parity. Its disproportionate share in global economic activity, though bound
to fall, demonstrates how large is the reservoir of physical capital, skills
and knowledge on which it is able to draw. Nor has recent overall
performance been notably dismal: total EU output has risen 30 per cent since
1980, the increase being almost as large as China's total gross domestic
product in 1990.
Current gloom is exaggerated, this being partly because of the recession.
But there is reason for gloom, all the same, as the FT series on European
competitiveness, concluded today, has shown. Total EU employment is, for
example, up only 6 per cent since 1980, against 18 per cent in the US;
output of manufactures is up 18 per cent over the same period, against 36
per cent in the US; and the share of EU external exports in world exports of
manufactures is down from 22 per cent in 1980 to 18 per cent in 1992.
Patent filings in Europe have not increased since 1987, while in the US they
have risen by 30 per cent. European spending on research and development has
declined over the 1980s, relative to that in the US and Japan. High
technology products account for nearly a third of US exports, but less than
a fifth of those from western Europe. To this picture should be added the
odd telling vignette. General Electric of the US targets European
competitors, but avoids Japanese ones, while airline operating costs are 48
per cent higher than in the US.
Europe suffers from high unemployment and poor job generation. European
firms tend to be weakest in the world's most dynamic industries. And the
European economy's poorest performance is in industries most exposed to
international competition.
National champions
What lies behind the failures? First, far too much of the European economy
remains shielded from competitive pressures. Second, European monetary
policy has occasionally been seriously misjudged. Third, labour costs are
too high and the labour market as a whole too heavily regulated and taxed.
Finally, business has too often failed to respond to the challenges of the
market place.
Solutions must be found partly at the level of the EU as a whole, partly by
the individual member states and partly by businesses.
Too many sectors of the European economy remain protected from effective
foreign competition and balkanised by the provision of state aids, the
promotion of national champions, the persistence of regulatory barriers and
use of discriminatory public procurement. At least one and often several of
these limitations on competition apply to industries as important and
diverse as agriculture, textiles and clothing, steel, aerospace and defence
equipment, motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, financial services,
telecommunications, energy supply and civil aviation. Virtually all of them
need to be subjected to greater competition and less protection, a job that
falls to the EU as a whole.
Monetary policy is still a matter for member states, but under the ERM and
now the Maastricht treaty, it is also increasingly a matter for the EU. Here
serious errors have been made, with the current recession partly the result
of an over rigid response to German unification. But now that both inflation
and inflationary expectation in core countries of the EU have been lowered,
the cost of disinflation should not need to be repeated.
Liberal approach
Management of the labour market, training and the welfare state is a task
for member states. They are in a position to choose among elements of
liberal and corporatist approaches to reform.
The liberal approach, often labelled the 'Anglo-Saxon' model, would be based
on labour market deregulation and lower taxes. Its main benefit is likely to
be greater growth of part-time service sector jobs. Its main defect is
likely to be less overall investment in skills and greater inequality in
pay.
The corporatist approach, sometimes called the 'Rhine model', would
emphasise a shift in the tax burden from unskilled to skilled labour,
combined with subsidies to unskilled labour and training, and an effort to
keep the growth of real wages below the growth of labour productivity. The
main benefit of this approach is likely to be more investment in skills and
greater equality among working people. The main drawback is likely to be
less job generation.
What is needed here is more experimentation. Each country can learn from
others. But it can do so only if it is allowed to diverge from the others.
The danger of the EU's social programme is that this desirable diversity
might be prevented.
Finally, searching out market opportunities, exploitation of new scientific
discoveries, linking up with institutions of learning, training workers and
responding to competition fall largely on business itself. Too many
businesses have remained dependent on the state. They must learn to become
dependent on themselves.
There is a great challenge confronting the member states of the EU. It is,
in President Clinton's phrase to 'compete, not retreat'. Much has already
been achieved, in the single market programme, in the moves towards
privatisation and liberalisation, and in the lowering of inflation. But much
also remains to be done.
The temptation to believe that Europeans cannot meet the new global
competition will be strong. But it must be resisted, since a retreat into
the cosy world of protection would doom Europe to rapid relative decline.
Europe will never possess the uniform mass market of the US or the
homogeneous culture of Japan. Its strength lies in its diversity, now
contained within the integrating edifice of the EU. The task facing
politicians is to find effective means of exploiting that diversity in order
to serve the common ends of all its citizens.

Putting a couple of bankers in charge of the Housing Corporation, the
government's biggest quango, is going to ruffle a few feathers. Midland Bank
boss Sir Brian Pearse, the new chairman, is not a housing man and Peter
Cooke, his deputy, made his name as the Bank of England's first proper bank
regulator. What do they know about housing poorer people?
True, Cooke has been on the Housing Corporation board since 1988 and Pearse
knows a bit about the business since he's been lending money to
house-builders for a very long time. Pearse, a Liverpudlian whose face never
fitted in the patrician corridors of Barclays, has more of a social
conscience than some big banking types.
Even so, the arrival of Pearse and Cooke suggests that the government may be
more interested in pandering to the City than to the social housing lobby.
With government housing handouts set to fall, the City is being required to
fill the increasing shortfall.
Meanwhile, having an ex-bank regulator as a deputy chairman may help calm
fears that the Housing Association movement may be becoming a hotbed of
financial hanky-panky with unpaid volunteers handling vast sums of money.

Far from the European Union resulting in some boringly homogenised

Thus British proposals about unemployment have been published with

referred to as the (pre-Maastricht) European Community; the French version
calls it the (post-Maastricht) European Union. Thus are sensibilities
soothed.

361m it clearly is. But Sorrell has talked about doing it for the past two

worked so hard to build up WPP, Sorrell is not keen to see it fall apart. He
hates the thought of selling anything.

Yesterday it listened as Labour member Peter Mandelson - cudgel-wielding on
behalf of the UK's top civil service union, the First Division Association -
asked Hogg what a member of MI6 should do if he or she found a divergence
between their own and the government's definition of 'the interests of
national security'. Hogg thought such a possibility 'inconceivable'.
But what should intelligence officers do if they felt there was a genuine
conflict between how they saw the national interest and how government
ministers regarded it? 'See a counsellor,' murmured Hogg.

<TEXT>
Vaclav Klaus, the irascible Czech prime minister, was in fine fettle at the
Adam Smith Institute in London yesterday.
'The Czech republic is no longer a post-communist country in transition . .
. Now we're a normal country adjusting to the post-transformation
realities,' he told his pinstriped audience. 'Our inflation is 10.9 per cent
 -but that's annual, not monthly as elsewhere in the post-communist world -
and our unemployment, at 3.8 per cent, is at levels which Mr Major can only
dream of.' Splendid.
Wait a minute. What about the notion that Czech unemployment is relatively
low only because the country has yet really to make a start on painful
economic restructuring?
Steam emerged from Klaus' ears. 'Nonsense,' he barked. High unemployment
comes from slow restructuring; low unemployment from rapid restructuring.
Ergo, the Czech republic's low unemployment is proof of successful, rapid
restructuring.
Breathtaking logic. But Klaus was reminded that restoring government wage
controls last year seemed to contradict his famed love of laisser faire
capitalism. Nonsense again.
'Part of a rational wage policy,' came the huffy reply. And keeping wages
artificially low is of course a million miles away from maintaining
disguised unemployment, that typical feature of socialist full employment.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Awash with uranium: Kenneth Gooding explains the market's
poor prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody has been hurt more by the surge in raw materials' exports to the west
that followed the break-up of the former Soviet Union than the uranium
producers. Some are bracing themselves for perhaps 20 more tough years
because military stocks, built up by the superpowers during the cold war,
are becoming available for the first time on world markets.
Russia has agreed that the US can convert highly enriched uranium, used in
nuclear weapons, to low-enriched uranium. This can be blended with other
uranium for use as commercial nuclear fuel. An estimated 500 tonnes of
highly enriched Russian uranium are available, equivalent to 150,000 tonnes
of commercial fuel - enough to keep the west's nuclear reactors supplied for
about three years.
As a result, uranium mines have been closing in Canada, the US and even in
some former eastern bloc countries.
The uranium industry has been in the doldrums for a long time. Prices peaked
at Dollars 45 a pound in 1978, when oil costs were rising sharply and demand
for nuclear energy was expected to grow. (The only large-scale application
of uranium is as a nuclear fuel.)
Over-optimistic forecasts of demand contributed to the build-up of nearly
80,000 tonnes of surplus uranium in stocks at power companies in the 1980s.
The market deteriorated further when brokers and other intermediaries were
allowed to sell some of this uranium to new consumers.
More recently, brokers also gained access to uranium stockpiles in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, as the new republics became desperate
for hard currency earnings.
A great deal of uranium is still sold directly by producers to consumers on
long-term contracts, but enough is sold in the free market for the US and
Europe to worry about the market's over-dependence on CIS material. Some
countries have curbed CIS imports.
Consequently, a two-tier price system has developed. For countries with no
import restrictions, the uranium price is about Dollars 7 a pound, its
lowest ever level in real terms. For those with restrictions on CIS uranium,
the price is about Dollars 10 a pound.
Even at Dollars 10, only the lowest-cost mines (in Australia and Canada) can
break even. However, some producers have unbreakable long-term contracts to
supply utilities at higher prices, even above Dollars 20 a pound. It has
sometimes been worthwhile for them to close mines and buy uranium in the
free market.
According to the Uranium Institute, an international industrial association,
the total supply of freshly produced uranium - from mines and reprocessing
of used nuclear fuel - was only 35,000 tonnes in 1992, compared with demand
for 53,000 tonnes. The gap was made up from the world's large uranium
stockpile.
The institute's present forecasts suggest this imbalance will continue. Even
if all uranium mines worked at full capacity, they could supply only 55,000
tonnes in 2000 and 49,000 tonnes by 2010.
But Mr Peter Wade, managing director of North Broken Hill Peko, a group that
controls the Ranger uranium mine in Australia, says mines would not come
back into production or new ones be developed until prices moved back to
between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a pound.
Meanwhile, demand remains sluggish. The institute reckons that it will be
64,000 tonnes in 2000 and no higher in 2010.
The supply deficit cannot continue indefinitely. Eventually the stockpile of
available uranium will be exhausted.
Prices, however, are not expected to recover in the medium term. The
agreement between the US and Russia for converting highly enriched uranium
into power station fuel specifies it should be organised in a way that 'will
have no adverse impact on US consumers or the mining and processing
industries'. But some producers fear that the existence of the extra stock
will give consumers the feeling the world is still awash with excess
uranium, and depress prices for years.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Wonder fuel to burning question: World stockpiles of
plutonium are growing. Clive Cookson and Bronwen Maddox examine the problems
of keeping it safe
</HEADLINE>

The concrete bunkers along the windswept Cumbrian shore are some of the most
closely guarded places in the world. Inside the heavy doors, a corridor
stretches away for dozens of yards. Sealed trunks are stacked high on each
side, as in a bank vault. Each contains a cylindrical canister 18 inches
high, and within each canister there are smaller ones, like Russian dolls.
At the heart is a white crystalline powder: plutonium oxide.
That is how civil plutonium, produced in the core of the UK's nuclear
reactors, is stored at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site. Its Pounds
2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant - given final approval to start operating by
the High Court last week - will add 5 tonnes a year to the world's supplies
of usable plutonium by separating the material from used reactor fuel.
The military aspect of plutonium can be seen at the US Department of
Energy's Pantex nuclear weapons facility in Texas, which holds 6,000
grapefruit-sized spheres of pure shiny plutonium metal removed from
redundant hydrogen bombs.
Plutonium is one of the most dangerous substances created by man, taking
account of all its political, economic, military, environmental and
radiological implications. It did not exist on the earth until the 1940s,
when it was created in the laboratories of Los Alamos, deep in the US
desert, in the race to build an atomic bomb.
Now the world has about 1,100 tonnes of plutonium - in weapons, separated
civil plutonium and unprocessed used fuel rods from nuclear reactors -
according to William Walker and Frans Berkhout of the Science Policy
Research Unit at the University of Sussex, who compile the most
comprehensive world inventory of nuclear materials. They say the global
stockpile is increasing by 60 to 70 tonnes every year.
For two decades after it was first created, plutonium was expected to be the
wonder fuel of the future. Governments expected it to become the driving
force of an expanding nuclear industry, as uranium grew increasingly scarce
and costly.
As recently as 1971, Professor Glenn Seaborg, head of the US Atomic Energy
Commission, surmised that 'plutonium could even replace gold as the
international monetary standard - at least it has real intrinsic value'.
Yet today plutonium is widely regarded as a menace with a negative value.
Japan and France, the two countries whose enthusiasm for the civil use of
plutonium lasted longest, are now scaling back their plans for fast-breeder
reactors which generate plutonium by burning uranium.
Last month France announced that it was converting its Dollars 4bn
Superphenix fast breeder, which has been mothballed for the past four years,
into a research reactor to look at ways of burning up plutonium - the
opposite purpose for which it was designed.
Although the Japanese Monju fast breeder will start up this year, several
years behind schedule, its planned successor has been postponed
indefinitely. So has Japan's own reprocessing plant, intended to extract
plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel like Thorp and the equivalent
French plant at Cap de la Hague, Normandy.
French and Japanese enthusiasm has cooled partly because uranium has
remained plentiful and cheap (see below). To a considerable extent, uranium
and plutonium are interchangeable nuclear fuels - and plutonium is so much
more dangerous and more difficult to handle that it will only come into its
own if and when uranium becomes scarce.
At the same time, large fast breeder reactors have proved technically more
difficult and expensive to develop than nuclear engineers had expected.
The plutonium itself has also brought new problems, not anticipated when
these projects began. For a start, it is difficult to store, decaying into
other radioactive substances which are more difficult to handle safely than
pure plutonium. But particular concern now focuses on the threat of weapons
proliferation, and on ways of safeguarding and transporting the growing
plutonium stockpile.
Most of the world's plutonium is mixed up with uranium and other radioactive
waste in used reactor fuel; this cannot easily be made into bombs. The
greater problem arises from the 90 tonnes of plutonium that have been
separated from civil reactor waste, and from the 50 tonnes of excess
military plutonium expected to result from dismantling thousands of Russian
and American nuclear warheads.
Critics of the UK's Thorp reprocessing plant say that it will increase these
dangers by separating out plutonium that would be less of a proliferation
hazard if it remained mixed in with the nuclear waste.
The US National Academy of Sciences reported recently that, contrary to
popular assumption, civil plutonium extracted from reactor fuel is adequate
for making bombs 'of at last 1 or 2 kilotons', equivalent in impact to
1,000-2,000 tonnes of high explosive. The amounts needed are not large - 6
or 7 kilograms, or about a bucketful.
Mr Walter Patterson, an energy analyst at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, points out that plutonium acquired illegally by
terrorists would probably have undergone radioactive deterioration and would
be unpredictable. 'They couldn't make small, elegant bombs to put on
warheads, but if they were happy to use a pickup truck as a delivery
vehicle, they could still wipe out much of a city,' he says.
A study carried out last year by the Rand Corporation, a US consultancy, for
the Defence Department, concluded that within a decade the world would have
enough surplus plutonium to make 87,000 primitive nuclear weapons.
Faced with continued growth in the plutonium stockpile, governments have
been wrestling with the question of how to put it beyond the reach of
would-be bomb-makers. A favoured option is to combine plutonium with uranium
to burn in existing nuclear power plants as 'mixed oxide fuel', or Mox.
British Nuclear Fuels is pinning its hopes on Mox to soak up much of the
plutonium coming out of its new Thorp reprocessing plant. Although Mox fuel
assemblies have been used on a relatively small scale in pressurised water
reactors (PWRs) since 1963, Mr John Guiness, BNF chairman, predicts that the
technology is about to take off in a big way.
However, Mr Walker and Mr Berkhout at Sussex University believe that BNF is
overestimating the likely popularity of Mox in the next decade, because
straightforward uranium fuel is so much easier to handle. They predict the
amount of separated plutonium will grow by at least 50 tonnes in that
period.
More spectacular suggestions for disposing of surplus plutonium range from
exploding it deep underground to launching it into outer space. Although the
National Academy of Sciences dismisses these as impractical, it favours two
other options: converting plutonium into glass blocks mixed with radioactive
wastes, and burying it in bore holes several kilometres deep.
But such measures cannot provide the whole answer. Nuclear security
specialists say the international system for monitoring and controlling
plutonium also needs urgent improvement. The greatest risk comes not from
plutonium separated by reprocessing in France and the UK, but from material
extracted from former Soviet warheads or produced in reactors in third-world
countries.
North Korea's refusal last year to allow inspections of two sites by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog, highlighted the
weaknesses of international agreements for monitoring plutonium and uranium.
It also raises questions about whether the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
under which signatories must permit these inspections, can survive when it
comes up for renegotiation next year.
The IAEA points out that it will need more resources simply to carry out its
present task of inspecting the world's radioactive sites, a task which is
becoming politically more controversial and technically trickier.
Although the IAEA does not initiate policy, it says its preferred option is
to see international sites developed for stocking the world's plutonium - if
so, Sellafield would be one obvious location. Mr David Kyd of the IAEA
points out that the agency's statutes would allow it to play the role of
plutonium caretaker.
But the problem is too complex to admit an easy answer. Quantities of
plutonium in the world are increasing, even though development of peaceful
uses for the material has been frozen. According to Mr Kyd: 'The point we've
been keen to drive home to people is that there's a problem out there. In
the mid-1990s, as nuclear weapons are dismantled, that problem will get more
acute.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government will shortly begin to consider which renewable energy
projects should qualify for subsidies under the latest round of the
non-fossil fuel obligation. The Noffo, as it is known, obliges electricity
companies to buy some of their power from generation sources other than
coal, oil or gas, and it finances the extra cost by imposing a levy,
currently 10 per cent, on electricity bills.
Although the greatest proportion of the levy goes to the nuclear power
industry, about Pounds 20m a year is available to support 'green' energy.
The money is allocated through a combination of competitive bidding by
applicants and ministerial judgments.
By all accounts, the new Noffo round will be heavily oversubscribed.
Applicants are proposing a variety of projects ranging from solar and tidal
power to landfill gas and coppicing. But the most numerous contenders by far
are wind farms.
In the past, the subsidy has been seen as a benign element in a worthy
environmental cause. But this time it coincides with an upsurge of public
concern about the proliferation of wind farms in some of the country's most
beautiful landscapes. The allocation of contracts will therefore be subject
to close public scrutiny.
Contrary to the impression environmentalists would like to convey, the case
for renewable energy is not very strong. There is no shortage of energy (the
UK's oil and gas reserves continue to grow, and output is about to set new
records), and there is little domestic technology to protect. The
environmental argument carries some weight, but far greater gains could be
achieved by raising the performance of existing plant than by encouraging
uneconomic green projects.
An efficiency gain of only 3 per cent in energy use would save more
electricity than could be produced from all the renewable energy sources
likely to be up and running by the year 2000 - and would avoid the visual
blight of much green power.
Unfortunately, Noffo money can only be spent on renewables. There is some
consolation in the fact that the system of competitive bidding is a spur to
efficiency. But since the government sees Noffo as a talisman of its
commitment to environmental matters, there is doubt about the rigour with
which it vets the projects which come before it. The only justification for
subsidising any power project, renewable or otherwise, is if it can stand on
its own feet within an acceptable time frame. The taxpayer owes no favours
to green power.

Sir, When US President Clinton punishes the naughty Japanese by banning one

gentlemanly game of tit-for-tat? Instead of refusing to buy American soya
beans or oranges, why not ban the export of something - liquid display

As to how to prevent this slowing recovery from the recession, the European

FT  09 MAR 94 / The FT Interview: Corporate camps divide and prosper - Sir
Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only eight months since Imperial Chemical Industries split itself in
two, and already the world seems almost to have forgotten the fact. Two
weeks ago, the first full-year figures from the new ICI passed off without
fanfare. Last week's results from its sister company Zeneca were equally
routine. One of the most drastic upheavals in British corporate history
seems to have passed off with scarcely a ripple.
This arouses mixed emotions in the breast of Sir Denys Henderson, chairman
of both ICI and Zeneca. On the one hand, he argues, silence suggests the
demerger was a good thing. If it had shown signs of going wrong by now,
'everybody would have been jumping up and down pointing out what a balls
we'd made of it'.
So far, the evidence is all the other way. ICI's pre-tax profits last year
were up 78 per cent, Zeneca's 42 per cent. More fundamentally, since the
demerger was announced in July 1992, the combined value of the two companies
has risen by two-thirds, while the stock market has risen only by half.
On the other hand, Sir Denys is plainly irked that so little credit has been
given for what he calls 'the greatest management story never written'. As he
tells it, the main feature of the exercise was the sheer hard slog involved:
not just hammering out the basic plan, but then sorting out the legal,
fiscal and commercial tangle of splitting up 500 companies and 130,000
people across the world.
This prompts an obvious question. Before demerging, ICI reviewed all its
strategic options. The one it plumped for was the most risky and
time-consuming. Given the drawbacks, what made demerger so very desirable?
Sir Denys has the answers off pat. Consider, he says, how the world of the
1990s differs from anything that has gone before. Economic growth is going
to be slow and painful. The classical chemical industry has largely run out
of ideas. It faces competition from new parts of the world, such as the Asia
Pacific region, and is obliged to spend more on the environment than it can
readily afford. The collapse of communism has created chaos in the markets
of eastern Europe, and has harmed a valuable customer in the form of the
defence industry.
Fair enough. But still, why was demerger the best answer? The answers here
are murkier, since they concern not only external factors but the internal
workings of ICI. The truth seems to be that demerger was the only way to
address flaws inherent in the ICI culture; and Sir Denys, a company man to
his backbone, is not about to criticise ICI if he can help it.
To begin with, it is clear that the abortive raid on ICI by the acquisitive
conglomerate Hanson in May 1991 was more formative than ICI has previously
cared to admit. It caused Sir Denys and his board colleagues to address
themselves afresh to two central constituencies: ICI's shareholders, and its
managers. The response from both was unsettling.
'We had the naive belief,' Sir Denys says, 'that in the heart of every fund
manager was a little bit labelled ICI.' In fact, many of the institutions
proved indifferent or hostile. At the same time, the directors sounded out
their senior managers. Again, Sir Denys says, the reaction was unexpected.
'They clearly did not wish to have Hanson come in, but equally they were
less convinced about the cohesion of ICI and the synergy across the group
than we had imagined.'
The important point here is that if Hanson were to bid, it would have been
on the basis of a break-up. The obvious defence would be that ICI was an
indivisible entity. Its managers were no longer sure about that. Nor, on
reflection, were the directors.
The purpose of a break-up would be to release shareholder value. This was a
point on which ICI's directors were becoming increasingly aware of their
shortcomings. Historically, Sir Denys says, shareholders had occupied a
humble position in the ICI scheme of things. 'A predecessor of mine - no
names, no pack drill - said to me, 'Denys, you seem to spend a lot of time
worrying about the share price. I'm not bothered about it. I just want to
get the technology right'.'
Historically, this is unsurprising. The 1950s and 1960s were a period of
phenomenal growth for the chemicals industry. 'Even when I joined ICI in
1959,' Sir Denys says, 'we had sales control departments. You could sell
every damned thing you could make.'
In spite of oil shocks and recessions, traces of this attitude seem to have
survived into the 1990s. The chief executives of the individual businesses,
Sir Denys says, were slow to accept that shareholder relations, dividends,
tax and interest bills at the corporate level were their concern. This, he
says, lay at the heart of a further problem: that they were unduly
optimistic about what they could achieve.
As a result, he says, ICI's investments had not been delivering the goods.
The remedy was plain: 'The CEOs needed to understand that there had to be a
corporate performance and a corporate relationship with shareholders.'
The reaction of these same CEOs to the demerger proposal was thus crucial.
Ten days before the demerger was made public, they were summoned to the head
office. The message was that the board was unhappy with their results and
wanted them to explain themselves.
'They all came in, somewhat apprehensive,' Sir Denys says. 'I started off by
saying: 'we aren't happy, that's all true, but there's a little bit more
than that'.' On being told of the demerger, he says, 'they were first of all
stunned, then their reaction was universally favourable.'
Ten days later, at the final briefing, some were showing signs of second
thoughts. 'There was a feeling of 'hmm - this is going to carry more
exposure with it. With greater responsibility comes greater
accountability'.'
According to Sir Denys, though, the first reaction proved the right one. The
CEOs, he says, have enjoyed a release of energy. 'There is a better
interaction with the centre. They have a better opportunity to put across
their viewpoint, not just on their individual business but the company as a
whole.'
One practical instance is that both Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of the
demerged ICI, and Mr David Barnes, his opposite number at Zeneca, now have
regular monthly meetings with their CEOs. In the old ICI, Sir Denys says,
this was not feasible.
When I was first a division chairman, I used to go to the quarterly business
meetings which the main board would have with the equivalent of the business
CEOs. They were pretty useless meetings. Everybody was busy showing what a
splendid chap he was and how well his business was doing.'
ICI, in short, was suffering from a baronial culture, in which the chiefs
were more concerned with competing than with the corporate good. Sir Denys
points out, a touch defensively, that in any large corporation there will
always be tension between the centre and the individual businesses. But the
real snag about the baronial culture, it is clear, was that it made it
harder to allocate capital for investment.
'We were too much concerned with fair shares for all,' Sir Denys concedes.
As a result, some of ICI's more geriatric businesses - Sir Denys's phrase -
were cross-subsidised when they should have been given the bullet.
A large part of the argument for demerger is that in the 1990s, speed of
response is more essential than ever before. Hence the case for demerger,
whereby the suppression of sectoral interests allows faster reaction towards
a common purpose.
But as Sir Denys freely admits, structural change is only the starting
point. 'Be clear on one thing,' he says. 'It will be quite a while before
each company proves how it can grow. None of us saw this as a magic wand.
It's the opening of a door, and it's saying to each company 'you have a new
start, but you've got to get on and deliver'.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Non-executives' role was the focus of
quotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OWEN GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir David Plastow's letter ('Non-executive directors' input is
invaluable', March 5) appears to be a delayed knee-jerk reaction to my Pall
Mall lecture.
A reader may prefer my generally accepted, though quite sparing, use of
hyperbole - 'blunting the edge' - in making a point, to his somewhat crude
rebuttal - 'ill-informed nonsense'.
After all, one does not need to have been an automotive engineer in order to
recognise the difference between the essentials of a vehicle and its trim.
As a matter of record, the quotation related not to non-executive directors
as such but to those requirements of a code which over-emphasise their
monitoring role; their independence from the business of the company; and to
their control over decision-making activities.
Sir David has been fortunate, or otherwise, in that his many experiences
appear to have arisen through company needs rather than from regulatory
requirements.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Allies' shaky footing: Croats and Bosnian Moslems make
uneasy partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it war or peace?
Peace, but not the kiss of peace.
A patched up affair, if you ask
my opinion.
And if you ask me, I think that
this peace
Is nothing like an end, nor like
a beginning.
TS Eliot - Murder in the Cathedral
Such is most people's instinctive reaction to last week's US-brokered
agreement be-tween Croats and 'Bosniacs' (Bosnian Moslems). It came so
suddenly, after nearly a year of savage fighting, in which both sides
emulated the methods used earlier by the Serbs to 'cleanse' the territory
they held of other ethnic groups.
Publicity about the Croat-Moslem war has focused on the plight of the
Moslems in and around Mostar, and on the intervention by the Croatian
regular army. This partly obscured the fact that in central Bosnia the
Moslems have been winning the war and the Croat inhabitants have fled from a
string of towns: Travnik, Bugojno, Fojnica, Konjic, Kakanj and others.
That explains the US-brokered agreement. The policy pursued by President
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, which was to support a separate Croat state of
'Herceg-Bosna' as the prelude to an eventual partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina
between Croatia and Serbia, has proved a disaster for the Croats. The
Croatian army had not succeeded in retrieving this disaster, but its attempt
to do so had brought down the west's wrath on Croatia's head.
In Croatia itself, the increasingly visible alliance with Serbia was
unpopular. All over Croatia there are refugees from the areas, amounting to
roughly one-third of the republic's territory, which were conquered by Serb
forces in 1991. These refugees, and many of their fellow-citizens, were
outraged at the sight of their own government conniving with the Serbs in
the carve-up of Bosnia.
So Mr Tudjman was glad enough to use US pressure and mediation as cover for
his admission of defeat - just as President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia,
and the Serb leaders in Bosnia, seized on Russian intervention to cover
their retreat when faced with a serious threat of Nato air strikes.
The Nato action may also have helped to swing Mr Tudjman round. Croatia,
whose whole raison d'etre as an independent state derives from its
self-image as part of the west (in contrast to the 'Byzantine' Serbs), could
not possibly take the Serb side once a serious confrontation developed
between Serbia and the west. If the west is now at last getting tough with
the Serbs, Croatia is bound to put itself on the western side, in the hope
of regaining control of its lost territory.
That indeed is the explanation of his volte-face that Mr Tudjman gave to the
Croats. For him the agreement is not really about Bosnia at all. A deal with
the Bosnian Moslems is simply the price the US requires Croatia to pay for
help in recovering Krajina. It seems there is some truth in this
presentation of the matter, since US spokesmen have started saying that
sanctions on Serbia will not be lifted until the Krajina issue is resolved.
Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear how the Bosnian government interprets
the Washington agreement. Most international reaction has taken it as a step
towards a 'two-republic solution' in Bosnia, based on the acceptance that
the Serbs of Bosnia will have a separate state of their own, linked to
Serbia, and that therefore it makes sense for the Moslems and Croats to pool
their resources and develop links with Croatia. This interpretation seemed
to be confirmed by the Bosnian prime minister, Haris Silajdzic, when he said
in Washington last week that Russian pressure is needed to get the Serbs to
agree to a negotiated solution.
But another interpretation is doing the rounds in the small pro-Bosnian
lobby in London. According to this view, the new Croat-Moslem alliance is a
step towards the defeat of Serbia. The Bosnian army has proved itself in
battle against the Croats, but also against the Serbs, for instance near
Banja Luka where small groups of Bosnian partisans have held far more
heavily armed Serb forces at bay. Now, with or without a formal lifting of
the arms embargo, the Bosnian army will be strengthened by the Croats'
change of sides and the opening of supply routes from the coast.
Such hopes are mirrored by Serb fears, as reported in an AP despatch from
Banja Luka at the weekend. The author, Julijana Mojsilovic, reports Serb
fighters as dreading a Moslem spring offensive. Superior Moslem numbers and
morale are beginning to tell in thickly-wooded terrain where heavy artillery
is of little use.
It is tempting to believe that the hold of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb
leader in Bosnia, and his thugs could be broken by a short, sharp spring
offensive with western support. It is tempting to believe that the Serbs
would then agree to peace on similar terms to the Croats, joining the new
federal republic, while Serbia itself could join the proposed confederation
with Bosnia and Croatia - thereby recreating a loose, confederal Yugoslavia
such as the Croats and Slovenes were demanding before the war broke out.
Tempting, but dangerous. It is good that the Serbs should fear a spring
offensive, since without that fear they are unlikely to make the territorial
concessions which are essential for a two-republic solution to work. But the
Bosnian government would be taking a risk with the lives of its own citizens
if it spurned such a solution and staked everything on a continuation of the
war. And those in the west who support the Bosnian cause would take a great
moral risk if they encouraged the government to adopt that course.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr GRAHAM J CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Savic (Letters: 'A lesson for the self-righteous', March 5) suggests
that Malaysia 'is reacting to the proposition that the British and other
western governments . . . generally know better'.
Dr Mahathir said nothing like that. The Malaysian prime minister's
grievance, as the FT editorial comment (February 28) stated, is with the UK
press, and as the wealthy libel lawyers would perhaps testify, he is not
alone.
If Mr Savic thinks the Murdoch press is in hock to the government, then many
hapless members of this administration can draw comfort from avoiding the
mauling they might have received from a less sympathetic organisation.
As far as the government is concerned, you quote the essential charge as
being one of hypocrisy. If that is all, then we can all sleep easily, as
nothing fundamental has changed. Linking money to services provided is not
new. I understand it has even been known to happen in journalism.
However, Mr Savic may wish to ponder the premise that, if the situation had
been reversed, would a similarly critical letter have received as much
prominence in Malaysia's New Straits Times?

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Serious fraud investigations should
not take forever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID LLOYD-JACOB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that in response to a parliamentary question about the
Serious Fraud Office's investigation of matters involving the flotation of
this company, the attorney-general said that the investigation was being
'pursued rigorously' ('Call for early Butte inquiry verdict', March 1).
The attorney-general is no doubt practised at believing the improbable.
The truth of this matter is that the Serious Fraud Office investigation, for
the first 18 months, was understaffed and ill-directed.
It has been much improved in the last two months, however.
This is not a criticism of the individual police officers, who have behaved
excellently; it is a criticism of their direction, and of the inappropriate
nature of the resources allocated by the SFO to investigate a Pounds 100m
fraud.
It would be a pity if it were generally believed that serious fraud
investigations in Britain had to take forever and be done badly.
With proper briefing and direction, successful fraud investigation in cases
such as Butte should take months, not years.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: CAP reforms or protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The warning issued by Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner
('East Europeans warned against farm protectionism', March 4), reveals the
blatant arrogance of the Common Agricultural Policy.
As Professor Paul Krugman has shown in a seminal article published in 1985,
in an industry exhibiting increasing returns to scale - such as agriculture
 -import protection is in many ways equivalent to export subsidisation.
The intuitive idea is easy to grasp: by hindering farm inputs, domestic
agricultural production is increased, per unit costs are reduced and, thus,
export chances enhanced. By the same argument, a popular fallacy about the
CAP can be exposed as well: instead of assisting developing countries by
lowering their food prices, it cripples their farming industries and
deprives them of foreign exchange earnings.
Consequently, Mr Steichen's demands amount to nothing else but denying east
European countries the same weapon the EU is employing against them. Without
any real CAP reforms, we shouldn't be surprised to see agricultural
protection continue its disastrous spread.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cosy club where favours can be
reciprocated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL BUDDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am not surprised by the praise that Sir David Plastow heaps on to
non-executive directors (Letters, March 5). He would say that, wouldn't he?
Of course he wishes to perpetuate this cosy club within which chairmen may
reward others for past favours or grant retainers and expenses for a few
days' attendance a year in exchange for the same favour on the other's
board. It is also a means of enhancing pensions for retired MPs and others.
Do Americans call them freeloaders?
I recall the high numbers of non-execs who served on the boards of some of
our one-time great companies like Rolls-Royce and Dunlop before they went
into decline. I remember how many times, when the Serious Fraud Office has
been called in elsewhere, the non-execs have departed crying: 'These facts
were not available to me.'
Why is it that company directors think they should receive several
concurrent incomes at shareholders' expense?
I applaud the policies of BTR, Lonrho and Amstrad. Who is Cadbury anyway?

FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: So far, it's still looking good - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the last few years as the government has driven British television
further and further into the marketplace - (Well that system has triumphed,
hasn't it? Socialism is dead isn't it? Why should television be unaffected?
No doubt the long march back to a sane mixture of market and social
economics will take a whole generation) - with ITV licences being auctioned,
Channel 4 made to sell its own advertising time and compete with ITV, and
the BBC's income ever more closely scrutinised and controlled, this column
has tended to make Cassandra-like warning noises about the quality of
programmes.
The argument has been that a fiercer fight for audience share would mean
increasing concentration on populist programmes and the reduction or even
abandonment of those admirable traditions which, in addition to populist
material, Britain's peculiar television 'duopoly' had been bringing us for
40 years: current affairs in mid evening, classic drama, properly funded
foreign coverage, arts programmes, serious documentaries on subjects other
than prostitution and transvestites, and comedy which goes beyond 'Ding-dong
Honey I'm home' to push and even kick at the existing limits.
Though the BBC's problems will probably never be entirely soluble, as was
suggested in an oddly ambivalent opening programme in a new run of The
Goldring Audit on Channel 4 on Sunday, and ITV has been operating under its
auctioned licences and its new central scheduling system for only 14 months,
with Channel 4 fending for itself for the same period, the time has come for
a cautious admission that - so far, anyway - the sky has not fallen. We are
not being subjected to an unrelieved diet of populism.
That is not to deny that there is a lot of it about. From The Big Breakfast
on Channel 4, aimed at toddlers of all generations, to Talking Telephone
Numbers on ITV, a sort of game show without a game; from a copy of an amoral
Brazilian series on BBC1, Do The Right Thing, with Terry Wogan, to the
sub-panto game show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush on Saturday nights on
Channel 4, the mindless, time-passing bonhommie spreads and multiplies. Yet
any honest viewer would have to admit that British television is still
offering more good and even excellent material than any well balanced
individual ought to have the time to watch. Perhaps it is not scheduled as
you might wish, but what is the point of a video recorder?
This new year season has already brought us Middlemarch from the BBC, an
adaptation which was not as good as some devotees pretended, nor as good as
the best literary adaptations in the past, Bleak House for instance, and
Brideshead Revisited. One of the greatest strengths of the television
Brideshead came from John Mortimer's decision to use the authorial
voice-over throughout. Why it was decided with Middlemarch to throw away
this invaluable technique by limiting it to a postscript (read in the
unmistakeably mumsy tones of Judi Dench) is a mystery. However, even without
it, this was an impressive series which showed that the BBC can - and will -
still do it.
It now seems highly unlikely, barring more radical changes, that ITV will
ever do another Brideshead, but on Monday they did begin another batch of
Granada's splendid Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes, 60-minute costume dramas
complete with hansoms, country house locations and, this week, a costume
ball with fountains and fireworks. Best of all Jeremy Brett and Edward
Hardwicke are still playing Holmes and Watson, the best pair ever to do so
on screen. Nor are we limited to fiction from previous centuries. BBC2 began
another season of 'Screen Two' with the extraordinary Genghis Cohn, a
production with the chutzpah to use comedy as a means to look again at the
holocaust. With wonderful performances from Antony Sher as the Dachau ghost
and Robert Lindsay as the former SS officer who shot him, it was perpetually
watchable even if the ultimate purpose was obscure.
So far as current affairs in mid evening are concerned, until three weeks
ago there was as much as ever: World In Action is still at 8.30, Dispatches
(which offered an interestingly alternative view to the government's on
Britain's mining industry last week) at 9.00, and Panorama at 9.30. True, at
present The Big Story, which replaced This Week on ITV, has itself been
replaced by The Big Race which, lacking competitors, ought really to be
called 'The Long Drive'. However, ITV has been as good as its word on
Network First (a dreadfully unmemorable title in place of First Tuesday) and
two weeks ago screened the film about a massacre in East Timor, made
clandestinely by John Pilger and David Munro. As usual with this pair it is
now causing a huge political row, which is presumably just what they wanted.
We are getting more vivid and engrossing foreign coverage in Phil Agland's
Channel 4 series Beyond The Clouds which is documenting life in a Chinese
country town and coming over as a cross between Margaret Mead and Coronation
Street, all displayed in Agland's startlingly beautiful photography. And on
Monday BBC2 began Video Nation, a huge 'Mass Observation' style programme in
which 55 video cameras have been given to 55 widely assorted people
throughout Britain. Remembering the striking success of the Video Diaries
scheme, this could prove to be very special - particularly if BBC2 can be
persuaded to show it in bursts of more than two minutes.
To make us laugh we have The Day Today, a series which is not only one of
the most original comedies for years, but one of the most effective pieces
of television criticism. Trevor McDonald and Jeremy Paxman now appear to be
mimicking their detractors in a. Madly determined effort to. Confirm all
those quirks which. The Day Today has so accurately identified.
Of course I may be speaking too soon. It could be that British television
today is in much the same condition as the optimist who was pushed off the
roof of the Empire State building and was heard as he passed the 44th floor
to be muttering 'So far, so good'. It does seem only fair, however, to
acknowledge that - for the moment - the best of British television is still
looking pretty impressive.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: Flamboyant director of Rome Opera resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER GREGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giampaolo Cresci, controversial director of Rome Opera, has resigned. His
sudden departure from the post, two years before his contract was due to
expire, ends a flamboyant regime marred by a L35bn (Pounds 14m) deficit,
spectacular backstage rows and talk of scandal.
In the latest crisis, Cresci was summoned to appear in court with the singer
Jose Carreras over allegations that the opera house paid the Spanish tenor
an unauthorised extra L130m - on top of the normal fee of L30m plus L10m
expenses - for a recital in October 1992.
The public prosecutor claims that a decision was taken to make an extra
payment to Carreras and describe it in accounts as 'sponsorship'. Magistrate
Filippo Laviano is seeking to try Cresci on charges of abuse of office.
Carreras' agent, through his lawyer, denies any wrongdoing on the part of
his client, saying that the singer was paid rather less than his usual fee.
The agent does not, however, disclose the sum actually paid.
The allegations follow a succession of sackings and rehirings and
accusations of extravagance of heroic proportions recalling, according to
one Italian newspaper, a Byzantine court in the last stages of decadence. A
payment of L27m was allegedly made for unnecessary English language courses
for the opera house fire brigade. L51m went towards a New York production of
Aida which never took place. Recently, more than 1,200 operatic costumes
were impounded by a renovation company, which threatens to sell the costumes
at auction in May if the opera house does not pay its bill of L1.25bn.
There have also been accusations by Roman concert institutions that the
opera house filched artists under exclusive contract to them (Rockwell Blake
from the Accademia Filarmonica Romana and Georges Pretre from Santa Cecilia,
who was later forced to return).
So catastrophic was the financial situation at the opera house that the
'Green' mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, appointed himself Rome Opera
commissioner and delegated the unravelling of the theatre's finances to
Vittorio Ripa di Meana.
'We can no longer allow the director to continue,' said Rutelli. 'We have
already waited far too long as more and more terrible stories about the
financial mess at the opera emerge every day.' Cresci was unperturbed and
dismissed the deficit as 'a mere trifle . . . no more than the cost of a few
tanks.' He went on to add, with unnerving candour, 'only an infinitesimal
part of it went into bribes.'
Last week, both Rutelli and di Meana resigned in exasperation at Cresci's
intransigence and the deputy prime minister, Senator Antonio Maccanico, was
obliged to step in. By the weekend, it was Cresci's turn to step down and
his resignation was accepted, while Rutelli and di Meana agreed to return to
their posts.
The queue to take over the job of director of Rome Opera, dubbed by Riccardo
Muti as 'Barnum's Circus', is not enormous. It is viewed by some as a
poisoned chalice. Mayor Rutelli's choice, Sergio Escobar of the Bologna
Comunale, has already let it be known that he would rather remain where he
is. The search for a successor goes on.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: Sacred fires flare amid quaint Flamenco capers -
Clement Crisp finds the Cristina Hoyos troupe has that uninhibited, raw,
earthy energy after all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Spanish Arts Festival is upon us and dance must inevitably play its part.
So the Cristina Hoyos troupe is in Rosebery Avenue this week, with the
spectacle given the unlikely title of 'Flamenco Dreams': anyone able to
dream through the rattle of handclaps and the clatter of feet will deserve a
medal. It is of course, yet another Flamenco show; more slick than most -
well staged; well danced; well vocalised in those arabesques of howling that
suggest permanent pressure on a favourite corn - and absolutely the mixture
as before.
The fascination of Flamenco in the theatre is that moment when production
falls away, the usual posturings are stilled, and the sacred fire flares in
a dancer. For much of Monday night's opening at Sadler's Wells,
predictability was all. The women, adept at slow-burning glances as their
skirts stir up the stage dust, look lovely - if occasionally miffed by what
the men are up to. The chaps, in buttock-hugging trousers and expressions of
baleful uncertainty, stamp, and go on stamping. ('Never live under a
Flamenco dancer,' is a good rule for flat-dwellers.) Guitars run the gamut
of tonic/dominant harmonising, and voices are raised in what I suppose is
supplication. I have no Spanish, but suspect that the texts amount to little
more than 'Watch out, she's on the war-path'.
All this is what we have come to expect, and if, as with Mme Hoyos' troupe,
it is polished and well-lit, then audiences are happy. They are what
theatricalised folk dance is always about: instant quaintness and capers
designed for tourists. But in this packaging one may, as in a lightning
flash, discern the real thing. The greatest Flamenco artists spontaneously
combust. As Isadora Duncan said after one extraordinary performance: 'The
god was with me'. So with the inspirational flamenco style. Carmen Amaya,
the truest Flamenco dancer I have seen, was, at her most intoxicating, a
gypsy divinity pursued by demons. Cumbre Flamenca, at the Wells a few years
ago, showed us two other marvels: Carmen Cortes and La Chana, whose art
became incandescent with rhythm and the very spirit of the dance.
With Cristina Hoyos, I feared that this transcendent moment might not
arrive. Her initial appearance - red flounces; arching torso; a star dancer
on display - told of obviously fine qualities that have always been hers:
glorious arms; electric timing. Yet it was an exteriorised performance, and
like most of what we saw, brilliantly contrived. Then, in a Taranto, Mme
Hoyos came on stage in a simple grey dress, as if to confront her art and
her own talent. Guitarists and singer started to commune with her. Urgent
rhythms, awkward poses, the dance kicking and battling, inhabited her
totally, and we saw the real, the raw and earthy flamenco which is so
wonderful - and so rare. Her arms curled around the block of her torso; the
music's pulse drove her feet and legs; nothing was polite, and everything
was thrillingly true. The god was with her, and we rejoiced.
Lest I seem in the least sniffy about the Hoyos troupe, let me say that
every artist is gifted, each number well-staged, and that prodigies of
stamping and rhythmic acuity abound. Adrian Galia is a most stylish soloist
 -his solo farucca tautly elegant. The evening runs to 100 minutes without
an interval.
Cristina Hoyos is at Sadler's Wells until March 12. Sponsored by Hola and
BSIS. Festival sponsors include Royal Bank of Scotland; Banco Santander;
BSIS; BT.

In today's 'Screen Two' drama well known actors (Richard Briers, Bernard
Hill, Billie Whitelaw) star alongside disabled people. Skallagrigg, is
adapted from the novel by William Horwood. The title refers to a mythical
figure, the hero of stories told by disabled people in hospitals all over
the country. Esther, a teenager born with cerebral palsy, undertakes a quest
to find this character (9.00 BBC2).
Dispatches reports on the case of Paul Grecian who was convicted of selling
arms to Iraq in what sounds like a dress rehearsal for the Matrix Churchill
scandal (9.00 C4).
What is a trebuchet and why has Huw Kennedy been trying for 30 years to
build one? According to the English dictionary it is a medieval siege engine
using a balanced arm with a weight on one end to sling projectiles at town
walls; rather like putting a kitten on a seesaw and dropping an elephant on
the other end. My 1924 'Petit Larousse' has a tiny but detailed drawing
which shows they were about five times the height of a man. Working Parts
(9.45 C4) follows Kennedy's attempts to build one.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Green legislation will test
Tokyo's sincerity - Japan is sharpening up its environmental policy, reports
Emiko Terazono in the latest in a series / Worldwide waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a recent letter to more than 600 Japanese manufacturers, Wakako Hironaka,
chief of the country's Environmental Agency, urged business leaders to
invest in environmental technology to help the struggling economy.
Although the Japanese government has embraced the green issue over recent
years to enhance its international image, it has done little to lay down
legislation defining industry's role in environmental protection or imposing
standards for industrial waste.
Just how genuine the government is over its pledge to become more green will
be tested later this year when it produces specific legislation to follow up
the Basic Environmental Law, a broad policy statement passed by parliament
last November.
After rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, a public outcry over the
sharp rise in pollution forced the government to lay down strict
anti-pollution laws. Cases such as the Minamata disaster, where toxic
mercury was dumped into the coast of a small seaside town in southern Japan,
or the Yokkaichi air pollution scandal, in which residents of an industrial
town in central Japan suffered severe respiratory problems due to the air
pollution from chemical plants, led to litigation by victims.
After numerous lawsuits against manufacturers and the government, tough laws
controlling air and water pollution were passed. Companies rushed to spend
on pollution control, investing 17 per cent of total capital investment at
the peak in 1975.
However, green legislation has hardly changed since then. 'Japan's
philosophy towards the environmental issue hasn't developed in the last 20
years,' says Ian Austin, the Tokyo-based director of Japan business
development at Dames  Moore, the US environmental consultancy. Because
Japan's industrial waste policy remains lax compared with that of the US and
Europe, the financial burden on corporations remains almost non-existent.
The agency had initially intended the Basic Environmental Law to include the
implementation of a tax to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to make it
obligatory for companies to conduct environmental impact assessments. But
opposition from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) and
the construction ministry led to the law being watered down.
Soil pollution from industrial waste landfills is expected to pose a problem
for the Japanese government and companies in the next few years.
Legislation covering user charges, which require companies to pay for
collection and treatment of polluted waste, will have to be implemented,
since the cost of closing down and cleaning up industrial waste landfills is
expected to be enormous.
From its experience with Minamata, the agency realises that clean-up is more
costly than prevention. The agency says that because Chisso, the chemical
company responsible for the Minamata poisoning, had neglected to spend an
annual Y100m (Pounds 645,000) in pollution prevention, its liabilities,
including compensation to the victims and local fishermen, grew more than
100 times to an adjusted Y11.9bn a year.
Austin says that leading multinational companies in the European Union and
the US are already applying environmental management policies to their
operations in Japan to avoid possible future liabilities.
Japanese businesses, meanwhile, have seen profit opportunities in the
development of green technology, and have also adopted action plans to show
that they are already environmentally sound, and do not need further
legislation.
In 1991, the Keidanren, Japan's leading business federation, produced a
policy statement which said companies should put board members in charge of
environmental matters, while in 1992 Miti laid down a 'voluntary plan
concerning environmental matters'.
Although such pronouncements have mostly sounded superficial, some companies
claim to be sincere. Toyota Motor says it will start producing cars in which
85 per cent of the body and engine parts can be recycled, while Toshiba has
stopped using ozone-depleting CFCs to clean its computer chips. Kao, the
detergent and consumer goods maker, promises to cut its industrial waste by
50 per cent by the end of next year.
But some companies' behaviour overseas may not be consistent with the way
they do business in Japan. Mitsubishi Kasei, the chemicals group, was forced
to close its chemical plant in Malaysia after local activists' allegations
of radioactive waste. Although Mitsubishi overturned a decision by the
Malaysian court in 1992 to terminate operations, the case damaged the
company's image and it pulled out anyway.
In seven years, companies will run out of industrial waste sites, and some
Japanese general construction companies have started to develop industrial
waste and soil pollution technologies ahead of likely controls.
Next week: Germany.

NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm of National

banks have traditionally been weak: providing financial advice to British
companies.
NatWest Markets has appointed Andrew Cartwright, a JP Morgan investment
banker, as a managing director and head of its UK corporate advisory work.
He will work alongside Gerbrand Hop, who concentrates on continental
European business.
The two men will report directly to John Howland-Jackson, deputy chief

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The CBI has appointed John Parsons as chairman of its Small Firms Council.
Parsons is chairman and chief executive of Time and Data Systems
International, a Poole-based company which makes electronic security
systems.
He replaces Richard Brucciani who steps down at the end of the standard
two-year period.
Parsons was a member of the British Overseas Trade Board from 1985 to 1993
and of a DTI national advisory group on the impact of the single European
market on small and medium-sized companies.
Parsons, who received a CBE in 1988 for services to export, appears to have
few illusions about what smaller companies can achieve in terms of growth
and job creation.
'Small businesses are recognised as the leading job creators and an
important source of economic growth,' he says. 'However, most of this comes
from a relatively small proportion of dynamic firms which have the potential
to grow.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / People: Earl returns to UK via Everest and Albania
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Earl, the corporate financier who last year was joint leader of the
Rebecca Stephens Everest expedition, is joining US investment banking
boutique Fieldstone Private Capital Group to set up a 'mainstream' corporate
finance function from London.
Fieldstone was started in 1990 by a team of structured finance specialists
who had previously worked for Bankers Trust in New York and London. While it
is hardly a household name, even in the City, it was last year ranked second
in worldwide project finance by the specialist publication International
Financing Review.
It has also had a hand in financing every power station built in the UK in
the past four years and it was in the course of a similar project in
Albania, where Earl has been advising the government on debt restructuring,
that the two parties met.
Earl's experience, while diverse, has not been with mainstream corporate
finance outfits. His own vehicle, Tranwood Earl, which is remembered for its
audacious but fruitless bids for the likes of Storehouse, collapsed in 1991.
For the past couple of years Earl has been working out of the US, following
a complicated deal in which he put The Carter Organization into, and then
rescued it from, Chapter 11. As well as his Albanian activities he has
recently been working on a communications project in Bolivia, the completion
of which he hopes to celebrate in May by ascending a 21,000 foot peak near
La Paz.
He says his wish to return to the UK is partly caused by a sense that there
is a revival of takeover activity. He believes his transatlantic experience
will be valuable and likes the idea of the US culture at Fieldstone. 'I've
trodden on a lot of toes because that is what the institutions wanted me to
do,' he adds, indirectly explaining why he might not fit so easily into a UK
merchant bank.
Earl is not being made a partner - there are none in London - but says he
'lives in hope'. He is bringing with him to Fieldstone three colleagues from
Tranwood days.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: East counts cost of a dirty
legacy - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania face a big bill after 50 years of
Soviet army sloppiness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Soviet army may be withdrawing from eastern Europe but it has left
behind an ecological mess. The bill for the clean-up operation will be
staggering.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are currently sizing up the fallout from 50
years of sloppiness at more than 1,000 former Soviet military facilities.
This legacy of Soviet rule, ranging from nuclear waste to water pollution,
should keep policy planners and eco-businesses busy for years.
Soviet pilots, for instance, would regularly dump jet fuel on the ground to
minimise flying hours. At the Tapa military air base in Estonia, 16 sq km
are polluted by jet fuel, 7m deep in some places.
At most Soviet airfields in the Baltic region - as in east Germany and the
Czech Republic - waste fuel, while not toxic, has seeped into the region's
shallow natural groundwater reserves and raised purification costs.
The World Bank has examined the damage at Latvia's Tukums air force base,
and is considering funding clean-up programmes. Environment Canada, a
government agency, has offered to train Latvians in site remediation and
assessment. But institutional lenders have yet to commit substantial funds
to clean-up efforts.
Meanwhile Baltec, a private Latvian company, has begun a bioremediation
project at Tukums. Over five years, it plans to pump out the jet fuel, some
of which can be salvaged and resold, and put bacteria into the soil to break
down the remaining fuel.
Inspectors previously barred from secret sites are finding other and more
worrying surprises. Near Zvarde, an eastern Latvian town, more than 24,000
ha of farmland were confiscated for air target practice. The land was
returned to Latvia after independence, leaving a trail of pollution,
deforestation and unexploded bombs after 30 years of daily bombing sorties.
Peteris Elfers, a member of parliament, estimates that demining might take
another 30 years. 'It has to be done,' he says, 'but we don't have the
technology to do it well.' An inspection last summer found 364 bombs, mines
and rockets after examining just the main bombing polygon of 159 ha - and
only cursorily to a depth of 20 cm.
Deadly waste understandably raises more eyebrows. In Sillamae, a closed
military city on Estonia's north-eastern coast, a classified chemical
combine has left a 20m-high dam that contains, according to Murray Feshbach,
an expert on the Soviet environment at Georgetown University in the US, 4m
tonnes of uranium ore, 1,200 tonnes of pure uranium, 1,000 tonnes of radium,
800 tonnes of thorium, plus 2m tonnes of calcium sulphide oil shale ash and
some ground radioactivity.
In a big storm, this could go into the nearby Gulf of Finland and directly
affect the Baltic rim countries. Feshbach says one safety measure, so far
not carried out, would be to encase the dam in cement.
Nuclear waste pockets have also been discovered across the Baltic
hinterlands. Last summer in Lithuania, radioactive equipment dumped at a
landfill in Zokniai, an airfield near Siulinae, produced alarming geiger
readings.
Paldiski, a big submarine base in Estonia, has two nuclear reactors, a
depository for liquid waste, another for solid waste and underground
pipelines for radioactive sewage. In troop withdrawal talks, Russia has
agreed to give up the base, remove the nuclear fuel rods and take care of
waste and the necessary clean-up. What should be done with the 600 tonnes of
liquid waste and the two reactors is unclear.
Estonia, which has a fiercely nationalistic government, worries about the
proposed length of a Russian clean-up presence until 2000. It may look west
for help instead, says Alar Olljum, a foreign ministry spokesman.
But Feshbach worries more about dimethylhydrazine, also called heptyl, a
liquid rocket fuel that is supertoxic, volatile, carcinogenic and nerve
paralysing. Around 270 tonnes - of the estimated 150,000 tonnes in the
former Soviet Union - have been found around Ventspils, a large Latvian port
city. 'There is no known technology to get rid of it,' says Feshbach. 'The
cheapest way is to fire it from rockets.'
However, Harry Whitacker, chief of emergency engineering at Environment
Canada, hopes heptyl can be turned into ammonia or methanol by using
ultraviolet light and peroxide in an advanced oxidation process; and nitric
acid, once pumped to the surface, could be converted to fertiliser if mixed
with ammonium and hydroxide.
On the Baltic Sea shore, military harbours have been left in a pitiable
state. At Liepaja, a top Soviet Baltic Fleet base, the harbour floor,
polluted by heavy metals and crude oil a metre deep, needs to be dredged.
Just off the coast sit sunken battleship hulls, stripped of non-ferrous
iron. Nearby are submarines which used batteries leaving semi-toxic residue
 -potentially dangerous if built up over time. Clean-up would be expensive,
but a World Bank official says the spectacular site of pilfered Soviet
warships might be a profitable tourist site.
The bank has made the conversion of Liepaja from a military into a
commercial centre a priority project in the belief that the city's large
port could be a key trans-shipment point to and from the Russian market. The
bank has obtained the Latvian government's commitment to support a project
of water treatment, coastal management and tourism. Environment Canada would
handle the military pollution.
Like any economically depressed nation, however, Latvia must make hard
choices on pollution clean-up. A clear economic incentive is needed to
secure funding.
Symbolic cost estimates have been presented to Russia, the inheritor of the
Soviet army. Latvia has sent Moscow a Dollars 147m (Pounds 99m) bill for
land use and anticipated clean-up. Realistically, however, the Balts do not
expect Russia to pay.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Management: Twelve steps to a successful speech - Talking
about the audience you are talking to is the key to public speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTER BRUDERER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who are these people?' If you are preparing to make a speech, and the
audience is already shaking your confidence, start with that question. It is
the key to public-speaking success.
Whether they are strangers or co-workers, they have one thing in common:
they expect you to dazzle them for the next 15 or 20 minutes. And the best
way is to focus on their favourite subject - themselves. Talk about the
people you are talking to.
Begin by defining who these people are and what they want. To help, here are
12 questions:
Are these people friends, co-workers, customers or strangers? Define their
characteristics and self-interests - the work they do, their education
level, the everyday language they use, and especially the problems and
opportunities that concern them.
Why are they here? What do they expect to get out of your speech? What do
they want of you? They expect to benefit somehow. Write these expectations
down.
Why were you invited to make this speech? There must be something special
about your background that is of interest to the audience. What exactly have
you got to offer? You must understand your qualifications so you can deliver
the speech they expect to hear. Audiences are easily disappointed when a
speaker steps out of character and ignores the reason he was chosen.
What problems do these people have? One of the best ways to win approval
from your audience is to recognise their problems and help solve them. Your
knowledge of their problems is probably the reason you were invited to
speak. They expect fresh insights, a different point of view, and ideas that
may help them. They do not want platitudes and generalities. One or two
specific ideas that stir their minds will send them away feeling their time
has been well spent.
What opportunities do they have and how can you help realise them? This and
problem-solving are the two best strategies to catch and hold the attention
of any audience. Your function is to help them see their opportunities, open
their eyes, stimulate their imagination, point the direction, and encourage
them to act. They came to this meeting expecting you to freshen and expand
their thinking.
What is the normal, everyday language of this audience? Once you have
settled on the big theme idea, the ultimate virtue is to express it with
absolute clarity. If your audience is from a certain industry, what
terminology does it understand best? The audience dictates your choice of
words. The best way to convey an idea is to use the language the audience
knows best, cast in the simplest words you can find.
Do these people like humour? Everybody does. But humour is a risky device.
What strikes one listener as clever may strike another as inane. The theme
of your meeting may be serious, and humour would be out of place. Few
speakers are good comic story-tellers, and nothing can be worse than telling
an old, inappropriate or pointless story. A light touch here and there, if
it does not interrupt the logic of your speech, is welcome, but humour is no
substitute for a big, useful idea clearly expressed.
How long should the speech be? When you were invited, you were probably
given a general time limit. The best rule is to take only as much time as
needed to make your presentation with absolute clarity. The only thing worse
than being too long and boring is being too short and only partially
understood.
Should you use visual aids? If they make your central point easier to
comprehend, yes. Keep them simple and uncomplicated because the audience has
only a moment or two to digest them. Explain every word, line, graph,
number, picture; otherwise, if you pass on without doing so, the audience
feels it has missed something.
What should your manner of speaking be? Speak loudly. Make sure your voice
carries distinctly to the farthest listener, so nobody has to strain to hear
you. The whole character of your speech - your enthusiasm, conviction,
emphasis, sincerity - can be lost if you speak with a tentative, soft voice
that makes listening a chore. Nobody ignores a loud voice, and there is no
conviction in a voice that mumbles.
How should you use your eyes? Make eye contact. Look directly into the eyes
of individuals, shifting from one part of the audience to another, from
front to back, left to right. This has the compelling effect of keeping
listeners' eyes on the speaker, feeling that he is addressing them
personally. It also makes you, the speaker, feel you have made personal
contact with individuals who are hanging on every word.
Should you make an outline? Yes, and consult it as you speak. It forces you
to organise your speech in a logical, coherent way, and keeps you from
running off the track.
These questions are just a start; add others to fit your occasion. Taking a
few minutes to understand who these people are, and what they want, is the
first step in making a good speech.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Management: At home in the office - How telecommunications
companies have used technology to transform their workplaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANTA RAYMOND and ROGER CUNLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications and information technology companies have long argued
that technology is an important tool in workplace design. What is less well
known is that many of them practise what they preach.
Companies such as IBM, Digital Equipment, British Telecommunications and
Mercury understand the full potential of modern technology, and apply it in
their workplaces in a way that offers lessons for others.
IBM has a tradition of excellent offices, but its Smart (space, morale and
remote technology) programme takes an innovative leap forward. At Bedfont
Lakes on the outskirts of London, IBM has divided individual workspaces into
four types: managers' offices, permanent workstations for administrative
staff, grouped and shared 'hot desks' for mobile consultants, and 'touchdown
desks' for other staff visiting the office for brief periods.
Consultants are encouraged to be where the work is: at the clients'
premises. When back at base (conventionally less than 40 per cent of the
working year), their 'hot desking' more than doubles the utilisation of desk
space. This cuts the amount of space needed, even when offset by an increase
in meeting rooms and rooms set aside for customers to work in.
The other main space saver is IBM's policy of grouping all filing, both team
and personal. Files are taken to desks in portable trays, personal filing is
minimised and desks are kept clear. The results of these and other measures,
says project manager Harvey Young, are more effective operations and a 25
per cent saving in space.
At Mercury Telecommunications the challenge is growth and change with
'awesome velocity', in the words of Chris Ridgewell of its Flexible Working
Applications Group, which advises customers on IT packages for workplaces.
When architects Austin-Smith Lord designed the interior of Mercury's London
headquarters, stress was put on flexibility; in particular, the IT
installation has a floor outlet point every 4 sq m, more than twice the
usual density. Yet with an organisation growing at 100 people a month,
technological flexibility and the acquisition of space are not enough.
The answer is 'virtual teams': people collaborating closely, but in a range
of locations. They may work from home, in the car, at a customer's office,
at 'third-party sites', in a branch office of Mercury, or at head office -
yet they work as a unified team. They are united by a strong sense of
'mission', highly sophisticated IT, skilled team co-ordinators - and a base
office that provides the right environment for anything from a 'touch-down'
visit to a full team brainstorming.
What sort of a physical environment makes a base office attractive,
welcoming and stimulating? At Digital Equipment's Stockholm office, a
virtual team was asked to decide this for itself. The result is a flexibly
planned area with consultants sitting in lounge chairs under an artificial
tree, their mobile filing trolleys beside them. At the press of a button
their computer terminals descend from the branches to a convenient height.
In the corner a raised cafe area is also used for informal meetings. The
general decor has hints of the golf course, the beach and the garden: all
places where the team said they felt at their most creative. The team
co-ordinators (executive secretaries) also work on a dais, giving them
eye-level contact with standing colleagues, a view in-the-round of what is
going on, and emphasising the importance of their role.
Idealistic? Lavish? Not if you take into account a 50 per cent saving in
space and a 20 per cent increase in productivity. The pilot area for 14
people has now been expanded to cater for 200.
BT's carefully monitored experiment with its directory inquiries staff in
Scotland is another approach to the virtual team: the static relocation of
some members of an in-house work group.
In BT's case 11 staff were detached from the Inverness office and set up to
work in their own homes. As well as telecommunications and information
technology, or 'telematics' (which included video links with each other and
with Inverness), BT developed special furniture, which was robust enough for
work use yet domestic in scale. It also considered the broader implications
of home-working - such as interruptions, security and child-proof equipment.
With the psychology department of Aberdeen University, BT is now evaluating
the year-long experiment. The initial reaction of the workers and their
families was very positive. The findings - some already published - are not
only for BT to use in its staff deployment, but to help its customers
contemplating home-working.
What does all this mean for the design of tomorrow's offices? Creative
change is essential if businesses are to survive pressures from new
technology, from globalisation, from demographic and educational changes in
the workforce, from concerns about the costs of commuting and its
environmental impact - and changing lifestyles.
The workplaces of these four companies show the way. For all their
technological sophistication, what is evident is the humanity; a concern
with the quality of working life. They show that offices are increasingly
becoming:
Meeting places as much as workplaces, places for group interaction rather
than solitary concentration;
Pleasant places, which attract and retain the shrinking number of new
graduates joining the ranks of skilled knowledge workers;
Flexible places, far more space-efficient and adaptable, reducing both
capital and running costs;
Humane places, often smaller and nearer home (or even at it) but still part
of a global communications network.

TRAINING
Denis MacShane, director of communications, International Metalworkers
Federation:
'Measures to provide workers with constant skilling and reskilling should
not just be supported. They should be demanded as a right. People should get
involved in consultations and information exchanges within their companies.
We should learn from the Japanese system where you are thought of as a
member of a company, not just as an employee - this helps limit
unemployment. I favour reductions in working time, which is out of kilter
with what is needed to produce goods and services in Europe. Employees
should support policies aimed at producing new products. In 10 or 15 years,
ordinary people as they grow older will have several thousand pounds worth
of health diagnostic equipment at home.'
SINGLE MARKET
Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz - secretary general, Unice (European employers
federation):
'If you project today's trends in Europe to 2000, the result is dismal. It
can't be allowed to happen. We have been divided up into little national
states, each one protecting what he does, each with its own airline, steel
industry and so on. We have missed out on the economies of scale.
We have the sees of recovery in the single market, but it's not properly
working yet.
'We need to tackle the problem of rising social security budgets, by
bringing in funded pensions. Our education systems need to produce people
who can adapt to high technology. The world recession won't last for ever.
When the upturn comes, it won't solve unemployment problems, but it will
give us the confidence to make difficult decisions.'
OPERATING GLOBALLY
Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM UK, head of an inquiry on
competitiveness by Britain's Royal Sociey for the encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce:
'During the next 10 years, it is inevitable that Europe's share of world
income will drop. It ought not to mean actual standards of living will
decline. However, we will have to reorganise social security. Just as,
inside companies, people look to their own careers and plan for themselves,
we are going to have to develop an increasing number of instruments to allow
individuals to take responsibilty for their future welfare.
'For businesses to prosper, there is no substitute for bright people with an
understanding of the industries they work in. In any high-tech area, you
have to keep abreast of what is happening and where advances are being made.
'
EUROPE'S PLACE IN THE WORLD
Prof. Michael Sturmer, director, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (German
government foreign policy think-tank):
'We shouldn't be so afraid of south-east Asia. In the long run, these
countries could get into deep trouble. The streams of weapons flowing there
will sooner or later explode. Their passage is by no means assured. They
have to deal with North Korea, and they may get into deep water with China.
'Europe is still one of the best places in the world to live in. We will
recover. Our recession in Europe is a matter of the last 2 1/2 years. We
should not extrapolate to 2005. Our problem is the excessive welfare state.
But, throughout history, Europeans have shown enormous resilience. And,
unlike after the second world war, we are starting out from a very high
level.'
SCIENCE
Dr Bob Whelan, chief executive of the UK Centre for Exploitation of Science
and Technology:
'Because it is inadequately prepared for change, Europe too often follows
rather than sets the world agenda for new products. The European workforce
must become more flexible and adaptable. If you never stop learning, you can
learn new tricks.
'Europe must recognise the need for world class performance in ALL aspects
of industries that force that pace of technology - information,
pharmaceuticals, automotive, energy and so on.
'There is too much introverted concern that the EU is the market. Companies
should show more interest in global markets, looking for new opportunities -
and learning from high quality customers elsewhere in the world. Companies
must to hunt in packs. There is still great scope for new collaborations.'
EMPLOYMENT
Padraig Flynn, European Commissioner for employment:
'If the EU can get down to a 5 per cent unemployment rate by the end of the
century - half the present level - we could live with that. Governments must
avoid simply standing still and waiting for a cyclical upturn to solve our
difficulties. Even if we increase our competitiveness, that will not
automatically lead to more jobs. We need to increase the employment
intensity of growth.
'Cutting wages is not the answer, although we need moderate wage rises not
exceeding increases in productivity. We must lower burdens on employers
caused by high non-wage costs.
'We need to look at new types of work: part-time work and lower-paid jobs,
at a fair wage and with reasonable social protection. Low-paid work can be a
source of a lot of comfort.
REDESIGNING COMPANIES
Peter Kraljic, managing director, McKinsey management consultants, Paris:
'Cutting costs alone is not enough - if companies simply restructure
downwards, Europe will just run into ever higher unemployment. Companies
have to be redesigned for growth. Manufacturing techniques and the location
of manufacturing are less important than people's attitudes and state of
mind.
'For 40 years we have had growth in Europe. Now we are like the US at the
start of the 1980s.
'Europe has to exploit its strengths. We have a large market, and an
incredible mix of nations with incredible talents. If we have the will to be
Number One, at an individual, corporate and national level, we can do it.
But we cannot expect a miracle overnight. It will require coherent action
and a lot of leadership.'
WIDENING EUROPE
Bela Kadar, minister for international economic affairs, Hungary
'Hungarian membership of the EU by the 2000 is realistic. We will bring a
dowry - not just the Hungarian market, but the flows of trade and technology
with the rest of eastern Europe. If they invest in Hungary, western
companies can increase their competitiveness. If obstacles to our exports
fade, Hungarian and foreign investors can produce not just for 10.5m
Hungarians, but for 400m European consumers.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Rivalries to the rescue in the search
for lost creativity - Diversity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder,
bloodshed - they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the
Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy
and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.' - Orson Welles in
The Third Man.
The historical detail is flawed. The Swiss have fought two civil wars since
the 16th century and did not invent the cuckoo clock. But Welles' monologue,
ad-libbed amid the ruins of 1940s Vienna, contains a poetic truth. Conflict
is a powerful spur to creativity. And diversity is the mother of conflict.
If Europe has a genius, a single defining characteristic, it is diversity.
In no other region is such intense intellectual, cultural and linguistic
variety packed into so small an area. Nowhere has the destiny of so many
nations been more powerfully shaped by continuous rivalry between them.
In some eyes, this is a debilitating heritage. It has, after all, exacted a
cruel price over the centuries in recurrent wars. Now that national
advantage is furthered more by economic than military means, it is
fashionable to decry Europe's heterogeneous structure as a handicap in the
face of the relative homogeneity of Japan and the US.
Has not Japan's economic success been based heavily on management by
consensus and a widely shared sense of national purpose? Has Hollywood not
conquered the world because of the scale economies available from its large
and integrated home market? Surely, logic requires European industry to
respond by closing ranks and presenting a united front to the world?
Such analyses, however, miss the point. At a time when technology and
liberalisation are forcing open markets worldwide, the toughest corporate
challenge is not to achieve global production scale, but to differentiate
products and services and tailor them precisely to widely varying local
demand.
In theory, these trends should work in Europe's favour. First, because
restricted home markets have long compelled ambitious producers to look
beyond their own borders. For many, learning to adapt to unfamiliar
conditions, and incorporating the lessons into their own operations, has
been a prerequisite of expansion.
Secondly, because many of Europe's enduring industrial successes have been
built on intensive specialisation and continuous striving to create and
enhance distinctive competitive capabilities. This is the story of German
capital goods, Swiss precision engineering, Italian luxury products, French
fashion and British pharmaceuticals.
The point was well understood by the authors of the single market programme.
Their intention was never to create a uniformly level playing field
dominated by equally matched industrial monoliths. Rather, by unleashing
fiercer cross-border competition, they aimed to promote specialisation by
freeing resources to flow to where they were most efficiently employed.
But the vision is still far from realisation. European countries continue to
cling to the notion that sovereignty requires a presence in a broad swathe
of industries, almost regardless of the cost.
For all the talk of EU integration, governments obstinately defend the right
of national steel producers to continue losing money and of sleepy
telecommunications monopolies and flagship airlines to charge high prices
for mediocre service.
Nor is such nationalism limited to bigger countries. It was clearly at work
in the decision last year by Swedish shareholders to torpedo the
Renault-Volvo marriage and in the collapse of Alcazar, the planned merger of
Austrian, Dutch, Swiss and Scandinavian airlines.
The result is not simply diminished efficiency, but the duplication across
Europe of largely undifferentiated structures in many industries. Instead of
breeding healthy diversity and creativity, national rivalry has perversely
produced sameness and common weaknesses.
In these circumstances, preserving existing structures wholesale is not
evidence of an ability to compete, but of a refusal to do so. The real test
will be how effectively European economies enhance comparative advantage by
abandoning poor performers and concentrating resources on those activities
which they do best.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Balance of economic power begins to
shift - David Marsh sees opportunities in Europe's lagging performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europeans are no strangers to periods of lagging economic performance. The
fortunes of ancient Egypt waxed and waned over 2,000 years, while most of
Europe was a barbaric wilderness populated by goatherds.
The cycles of world history have since accelerated and become
interconnected, to a degree barely conceivable even a generation ago. As it
tackles the problem of fading dynamism, Europe must weather a phase of
unsettling political and economic transition.
'Europe can be under no illusion that it faces very strong competition from
the US and Asia,' says Mr Ernst-Antoine Selliere, vice-president in charge
of economic affairs at the French Patronat employers' organisation. 'But,
provided we loosen constraints on our competitiveness, this can be an
opportunity.'
The European nations that launched the manufacturing revolutions of the 18th
and 19th centuries ceded industrial leadership to the US after the first
world war. Now, as a result of global upheavals in technology and
communications, another shift in the balance of economic power may be
imminent - this time, towards the rapidly expanding economies of the Pacific
Rim.
Using World Bank data and its own assumptions about future growth, Union
Bank of Switzerland (UBS) projects that, in the first decade of next
century, purchasing power income per head in Singapore and Korea will exceed
that of the US. Incomes in Singapore are already close to the west European
average.
According to similarly derived projections by UK accountants Coopers and
Lybrand, the share of world GDP taken by Asian developing countries
(including both China and India) could rise to 28 per cent in 2010 from 18
per cent in 1990. Western Europe's share would fall to 17 per cent from 22
per cent, while the US's would fall to 18 per cent from 23 per cent.
This projection assumes annual growth in both western Europe and the US of
2.5 per cent, against 6 per cent in Asia. Even if the growth differential is
less, Europe will drop down the economic rankings. But Europe's likely
decline needs to be put into perspective.
First, it is natural that less well-off countries move closer to wealthy
ones. Over the past 20 years, the gulf between many rich and poor countries
has widened. Where gaps have narrowed, they normally remain large. According
to World Bank figures (based on constant dollar exchange rates rather than
purchasing power parities), by 2000 the ratio between average GDP per capita
in western Europe and east Asia will be an 18 to 1, compared with 48 to 1 in
1970.
Second, as living standards rise in less developed countries, wealth should
flow back to Europe through increased trade and investment. Provided
European companies match international advances in management and
technology, Europe can maintain a strong competitive advantage in goods and
services the rest of the world wants. This requires that borders remain open
and protectionist pressure is resisted.
Professor Richard Portes, director of the London-based Centre for Economic
Policy Research, believes a narrowing of the wealth gap between Europe and
the rest of the world need not be disastrous. 'I'm very sceptical about the
views of the doomsayers.'
Differences in real wages between western Europe and other manufacturing
regions will narrow, he says, in the same way that US wages, relative to
those in Europe, have fallen since the 1950s. This need not stop European
living standards rising.
According to UBS's projections, western Europe's growth rate will pick up
early in the 21st century, as the continent benefits from the 'catch up'
phenomenon, under which countries that lag adopt innovations from the
leaders.
A striking example of 'catch up' has been US success in the 1980s in
reacting to the competitive threat from Japan by importing 'just-in-time'
Japanese production technology, says Mr Bill Gasser, UBS's senior
international economist.
But, as it tries to adapt, Europe has one big disadvantage. The
fast-increasing share of GDP taken by government spending in the past decade
 -a rise well under way before the onset of the European recession in
1992-93 - has imposed a growing burden on business.
Social spending is the biggest single portion of these outlays. The OECD
says social security transfers in the EU will account for 21.5 per cent of
GDP in 1994, up from 16.4 per cent in 1989 - double the percentage rise in
the last downturn in 1979-1982. In relation to GDP, EU social transfers
exceed US and Japanese levels by 50 per cent and 78 per cent.
As a community of nation states, western Europe faces greater difficulties
than the US did a decade ago in adopting common policies to recover
dynamism. But Europe's diversity is also a trump card. Different parts of
the continent can draw upon varying strengths and specialisations.
There is little disagreement on the diagnosis of Europe's core problems. The
task is to implement corrective measures:
Growth of public spending on welfare is placing intolerable strains on
budget deficits - one reason for high taxes and interest rates. Beyond
simply cutting benefits, governments need a new balance between public and
private sector social security provision.
The number of old people in Europe could outstrip resources to care for
them. Imaginative solutions will be required, returning the elderly to
family environments and using technological advances to moderate medical
costs.
More flexible labour markets are needed, including improved possibilities
for part-time work and less rigid wage-bargaining mechanisms. The collapse
in demand for unskilled labour creates the potential for an integrated tax
and welfare system allowing low-paid workers to be paid partly by employers
and partly by tax credits.
Europe must overcome its technological lag. Companies at the forefront of
scientific advance must improve links both to the markets they serve and the
education establishments on which they draw. Europe needs a better balance
between the costs and benefits of environmental regulation. Environmental
rules have not yet been a significant spur to innovation or competitive
advantage. Plans for further integration, including widening (early next
century) to central and eastern Europe, need to be based on liberal,
open-market principles.
Governments know Europe can prosper only if companies think globally. This
can lead to some sharp modifications. Pointing to the large number of German
companies shifting production abroad to escape high domestic costs, Mr
Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry,
says companies are moving away from a 'Made in Germany' towards a 'Designed
in Germany' concept. German industry will regain competitiveness, he says.
But he admits doubts on how German society will cope with the strain.
This type of corporate reaction can be painful, but the absence of
adjustment would have still more disturbing consequences. If European
enterprises and employees can muster the flexibility to manage change and
the flair to master it, salvation is assured.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Recruitment: Pegs in round holes need not be square -
Performance targeting and appraisal is stifling innovation in the
marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stories that cast doubts on the value of the most thorough processes of
recruitment should be treated with caution, but they are very tempting to
relate nevertheless. This one I am told is true and I have a name for the
man involved, Dante Montalbetti, a former head of Eurobond trading in the UK
at Merrill Lynch, the US securities house.
The story goes that, impressed by his mental agility at calculating the
weekly quota, Montalbetti hired a milkman to work as a trader around the
time of Big Bang in the mid 1980s. The milkman enthusiastically swapped his
electric milk float and a modest wage for a telephone-digit salary and a
Porsche. Then came the 1987 crash and he was made redundant in one of the
clear-outs. Today he has returned to his Surrey milk round where the only
traded options are whether his customers order one pint or two.
The story sounds too good to be true and certainly Merrill Lynch was unable
to provide any supporting evidence, so it may have to be discarded into the
apocryphal bin. But what is to be learned from it anyway? Does it mean that
milkmen make good bond traders or that bond traders make good milkmen?
Its main point here is to demonstrate that there will always be cases of the
individual whose career path has wavered from conventional routes. Surely
this reflects the diversity of backgrounds that many employers would wish to
encourage. Not so, apparently. A contributor at a recent business forum
spoke of an Oxford college tutor seeking placements for four of his
graduates taking degrees in music, history, Latin and geography. The
qualifications were dismissed as useless by a company recruiter who was only
interested in business studies degrees.
Such attitudes are not unique. Further evidence of a polarity of approach
was volunteered by a headhunter who said that one securities company in the
US designed a psychometric test to search for the principal personality
traits exhibited by its most successful trader. The very idea of such
vocational cloning might seem like kindling for a bonfire of vanities to
some but it has attracted interest, particularly in sales areas.
Less finely tailored selective recruitment procedures, using structured
interviews instead of pencil and paper tests to sift out desired personality
traits, are available and used in the UK. BQ, the UK do-it-yourself chain
has started using them and Joshua Tetley, the Leeds brewer, has used them in
its selection of public house managers.
The kind of structured interviews that can find successful sales people can
also single out innovators, says Terry Lunn, managing director of Talent
Plus (UK), a company that administers structured interviews. But some
occupational psychologists believe that creative people are being neglected
by recruiters and managers.
A new report from the British Psychological Society says that if we really
want innovators in our organisations, we are going the wrong way about
encouraging them. The authors say that modern performance-orientated
incentives threaten to suffocate the individuality and creativeness which
once made British industry the envy of the world.
Kay's Flying shuttle, Arkwright's loom, Hargreaves' Spinning Jenny and
Crompton's mule all played their part in revolutionising the textile
industry upon which much of the UK's 19th century wealth was founded. Where
are their equivalents now and would we value them in our workplaces if we
could find them?
Michael West, an occupational psychologist at Sheffield University and one
of the report's authors, believes that innovators today are getting a raw
deal. In many organisations their potential is stifled by performance
appraisal and targeting, he argues. They need to be identified, nurtured,
and given the time and space they need to make things happen.
He points to 3M, which gives each of its research and development staff the
option to spend 15 per cent of their time at work to use as they wish in
their own projects and experiments. This may help account for the fact that
30 per cent of the company's turnover is from products introduced in the
last four years. 'If the project fails then their job is not on the line,'
said West.
With co-authors Professor Clive Fletcher, of Goldsmith's College, University
of London, and John Toplis of the Post office training and development
group, West has written a paper entitled 'Fostering Innovation'*, demanding
greater emphasis on identifying and encouraging innovators.
It is true, say the authors, that innovators can be unconventional people,
unattracted by routine work requiring attention to detail. Their thinking
may challenge orthodoxy, threaten general managers and be impractical.
'However, organisations also have to recognise that the complete exclusion
of such people could lead to stagnation,' they warn.
Much of their argument reflects a growing dissatisfaction among many
employers with performance-related pay. Up to now one of the main objections
to PRP has been that it is divisive. Some have argued additionally that it
can be demotivating. This new paper goes further, suggesting that it can
actually stultify the natural creativity of individuals.
Fletcher says: 'When you look at all those companies in the private sector
which have gone through downsizing and de-layering and introduced
performance management practices, performance-related pay and appraisal
systems, it has led to leaner fitter organisations . . . The cost has been
to their capacity to innovate.'
'As you make increased demands on each individual the pressure increases and
it becomes difficult to get the time to reflect on what you are doing.'
The trend in many organisations, he argues, has been to place too strong an
emphasis on short-term business goals that provide the reward, with
redundancy or dismissal often the price of failure.
Fletcher suggests that too much emphasis on PRP tends to shift people's
focus away from the task and on to the money they receive for its
accomplishment. 'A manager of a clearing bank told me: 'People here never
used to think about money. Now they think of nothing else.''
'People need to be encouraged to feel confident. Managements should get rid
of PRP. It has not been an effective motivator. We have to start rewarding
innovation and put it on the agenda.' Fletcher's comments would suggest that
while performance-related pay is by no means dead as a form of reward, it is
clear that some are already digging its grave.
The report also seeks to promote the potential of teams built of diverse
skills. It draws on a footballing analogy to make the point that a team will
be ineffective if comprised solely of attacking players or conversely of
defensive players. It needs a balance. This same observation has been made
during a research programme at Roffey Park Management Institute focusing on
the management of creative individuals in areas like music, theatre, sport,
and corporate research and development.
Joanna Howard, director of research notes that while the idiosyncrasies and
insecurities of creative people can be taxing on managers, the reward in
terms of innovation for those that persevere can be incalculable. But she
also warns that matching their abilities with equally spectacular financial
rewards is not necessarily motivating. 'Putting extrinsic rewards to things
that people do for their intrinsic love of it can be terribly damaging,' she
says.

The British went on a record 56m holidays last year but the proportion taken
in the UK fell to its lowest level ever, the British Tourist Authority said
yesterday.
British residents took 32.5m holidays of four nights or more in the UK last
year, 1.6 per cent up on 1992. But the number of foreign holidays increased
by 8 per cent to 23.5m. The share of holidays taken in the UK was 58 per
cent, compared with 60 per cent in 1992.
The number of domestic holidays taken rose from 31.5m in 1960 to more than
40m in the mid-1970s, before falling to 28.5m in 1987.
Over the same period there has been a sharp increase in the number of
holidays taken abroad. In 1960, only 3.5m Britons took their holidays
abroad. By 1980 the number had reached 12m.
While more Britons go abroad, a record number of foreign tourists have
visited the UK. The Central Statistical Office said last week that the
number of overseas visits to the UK rose 4 per cent to 19.3m last year.
However, the increase in the number of Britons going abroad resulted in a
rise in the travel account deficit of the balance of payments to Pounds
3.7bn last year, compared with Pounds 3.4bn in 1992.
Ms Adele Biss, BTA chairman, said yesterday: 'Our tourism industry cannot
survive on growth from overseas visitors alone. Nor can we expect cut-throat
competition from package holidays to disappear.'
She added that the UK tourist industry needed 'more focus on quality
standards, value for money, more energetic promotion and better marketing.
This is not by any means an impossible task. But we need greater commitment
from government and the industry, working in partnership, to arrest this
decline.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Incapacity bill gains majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill aimed at ending abuse of invalidity benefit by introducing a new
incapacity benefit from April next year was given a third reading by a
majority of 26 (302-276) in the Commons last night.
Charges by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs that it would penalise people
genuinely unfit for work were denied by Mr Nicholas Scott, minister for the
disabled.
A more objective medical test, which is still the subject of consultation,
will determine eligibility. The benefit, which will be taxed, will be
payable from the first day of incapacity for those who do not qualify for
statutory sick pay.
Mr Scott confirmed that existing invalidity benefit claimants would not
suffer financial loss through moving to the new benefit. 'There will be no
cash losers at the point of change,' he said.
Mr Scott said expenditure on invalidity benefit had increased from Pounds
2.4bn in 1979 to Pounds 6.1bn in 1992-93. While expenditure would continue
to grow under the arrangements authorised by the bill, it would be more
clearly focused on the long-term sick.
Mr Keith Bradley, a shadow junior social security minister, emphasised
Labour's 'root and branch' opposition to the bill and looked to the House of
Lords to make substantial amendments.
Mr Jim Wallace, for the Liberal Democrats, feared the medical test would be
'mechanistic' and result in people being deemed to be capable of work when
there was little prospect of them finding any.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Abu Dhabi improves BCCI offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday provisionally approved a revised deal with the government of Abu
Dhabi which should pave the way for an increased payment to creditors.
Under the terms of the settlement, Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in
the bank, is expected to increase its direct cash contribution to about
Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.23bn). It had previously agreed a payment of at
least Dollars 1.2bn.
The agreement requires the ratification of the BCCI creditors committee,
which failed to meet formally yesterday following a dispute over the
confidentiality by which its members are bound.
The money available under the agreement for distribution to the bank's
hundreds of thousands of creditors around the world will be raised further
as a result of the settlement because Abu Dhabi has agreed to restructure
and reduce a number of its claims against BCCI. It is expected to drop its
potential claim for Dollars 2.2bn of assets it alleges were stolen by the
bank, and in exchange may receive protection from future litigation which
could be brought against it by the liquidators.
Efforts to reach a new deal have been under way since October, when the
Luxembourg appeal court rejected on technical grounds a previous settlement
between the liquidators and Abu Dhabi.
The new agreement has been modified to address these problems and has been
considerably simplified in an effort to achieve an easier and speedier
settlement for creditors.
If the creditors committee ratifies the agreement, it will still require
approval by the English, Cayman Islands and Luxembourg courts, which may
delay a first payment for several months. The liquidators have never revised
their original estimated payments of 30p to 40p in the pound.
The liquidators from Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, yesterday promised a
briefing with 'an important announcement about compensation for creditors'
but then cancelled it following the unexpected way in which discussions with
the creditors' committee developed.
The Abu Dhabi settlement was concluded after final negotiations with the
liquidators in Zurich last week. The government of Abu Dhabi indicated last
month that it was keen to see creditors receive increased compensation for
their losses.
Other money available to creditors will come from liquidation of BCCI's
assets, up to Dollars 150m paid by Abu Dhabi to the US authorities as
settlement of legal actions, and from any proceeds of litigation against the
bank's auditors, the Bank of England and National Commercial Bank of Saudi
Arabia.
If an agreement had not been reached the liquidators would have had to
consider suing Abu Dhabi, which risked jeopardising any payouts for many
years.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Germans aim to lift British purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz has set up a subsidiary to co-ordinate plans for increasing
component purchases in the UK.
The group, which includes truck and carmaker Mercedes Benz, AEG and Deutsche
Aerospace, says it is spending Pounds 200m a year in the UK.
The new company, Daimler-Benz Purchasing Co-ordination (UK), will be based
at Mercedes' headquarters in Milton Keynes.
The group says it intends to increase purchases made outside Germany - in
other countries as well as the UK - from 17 per cent to 25 per cent of
spending. This represents additional spending outside Germany of DM4bn, or
just more than Pounds 1.5bn.
Mr Peter Stangl, the new company's managing director, said: 'We want to make
even more use of the British procurement market. Prices are competitive and
standards are high, so there are many opportunities for suppliers.' New car
sales will exceed 2m this year for the first time since 1990, the motor
finance arm of National Westminster Bank said yesterday.
The forecast, by far the most optimistic from any industry source, was made
by Lombard Motor Finance.
About one in five of all new cars purchased by a finance arrangement goes
through Lombard.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Light van sales higher in February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of light vans made their long-awaited upturn last month, broadening
the commercial-vehicle market recovery to every sector except buses, coaches
and utility four-wheel-drive vehicles.
In some areas of the market the sales surge last month reached spectacular
levels, with the important heavy trucks sector - over 15 tonnes - up 31.9
per cent compared with February last year.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that
sales of light vans - mainly those derived from cars - rose 5.9 per cent, to
5,334 from 5,037, reversing a long declining trend.
Sales of larger panel vans, typified by the Ford Transit, were 14.8 per cent
higher last month than in the same period a year ago, at 7,040 from 6,133.
Leyland Daf, recovering from the former Daf group's term in receivership
early last year, said: 'The market has definitely turned. Dealers are
reporting many more inquiries being turned into orders and we're now seeing
fleet customers who we haven't talked to for a considerable time.' It is
increasing weekly output from 200 vans to 250.
The market for trucks - vehicles over 3.5 tonnes - was up 11.95 per cent
last month, the statistics show. Last month's 8.13 per cent rise in total
new commercial vehicle registrations, to 16,312 from 15,085 a year ago,
raised the total for the first two months of the year to 33,954, a 4.46 per
cent rise from 32,503 in the same period last year.
Imports continue to take a larger share. They rose to 42.57 per cent last
month compared with 40.95 per cent in the previous February, and to 42.62
per cent in the first two months compared with 39.89 per cent in the same
period last year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Counties attacked over spending on publicity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers have fuelled the row over the English local government review by
attacking Essex and Surrey county councils for spending too much on
literature publicising their case.
Both counties responded that their spending was necessary to meet
requirements set by the Local Government Commission. They said district
councils, which Department of the Environment ministers excluded from
criticism, had spent far more.
Most district councils favour creating small, all-purpose unitary
authorities while counties prefer either the existing two-tier system of
counties and districts or the creation of large unitary authorities. All
councils are expected to make submissions to the commission by the end of
May.
Essex said it 'absolutely refuted' the charge. It said the county had still
not decided on a new structure to recommend to the commission, and had so
far spent only Pounds 10,000 on a consultation leaflet, of which 25,000
copies had been printed.
Surrey estimated its expenditure - incurred producing two leaflets and
commissioning a Harris poll of residents - at Pounds 20,000.
Mr Michael Jennings, deputy chief executive, said this had been incurred
under guidance from the commission. He estimated that the 11 Surrey district
councils had spent 'at least Pounds 100,000' on the review.
Each of them paid Pounds 7,500 to CSL, the managed services division of
accountants Touche Ross, to prepare financial estimates for their
submission, which calls for five or six unitary councils.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Sporting Bentley design unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars yesterday surprised the Geneva motor show by
unveiling a concept study for a 'smaller' Bentley convertible and coupe.
The model, if it is put into production, could come close to doubling
production volumes by the end of the decade.
The Concept Java 'could set the scene for the next generation of sporting
Bentleys', the company said. Mr Peter Ward, chief executive of Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars, said the company would test the concept and customer views 'for
at least one more year'.
Development of the car would take four or five years, meaning that
production could start by the end of the 1990s. 'If we do it, we would aim
to have it in the market before the year 2000,' said Mr Ward.
He said the car could sell for Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 100,000, bringing it
into direct competition with luxury sports cars such as the Mercedes-Benz
600 SL. Current Rolls-Royce and Bentley models cost from Pounds 97,000 to
Pounds 175,000.
Mr Ward said research indicated that Bentley could sell 1,500 to 2,000 cars
a year in this market worldwide. The Java has been developed in a
collaboration between Rolls-Royce's design team and the Warwick-based Design
Research Associates headed by Mr Roy Axe, former chief designer of Rover.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering and
defence group, has only recently returned to break-even after suffering
heavy losses in 1991 and 1992.
The technology for Java's 3.5-litre engine has been developed by Cosworth
Engineering, another Vickers subsidiary. A theoretical top speed of 170mph
would be electronically limited to 155mph.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Elderly's share of benefits falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proportion of the social security budget going to elderly people is
falling, says the annual report of the Department of Social Security.
Four years ago, elderly people took up half of all benefits expenditure,
mainly through state pensions. By 1996-97 this will have fallen to less than
45 per cent of the total.
Over the same period, the share of social security going to long-term sick
and disabled people will rise from 16 per cent to 22 per cent. Legislation
to curb the growth in numbers claiming such benefits is passing through
parliament.
The report says that benefits have become better targeted in recent years,
with 95 per cent going to people in households with below-average income.
Since 1988 extra spending has been directed at low-income families with
children and pensioners receiving income support. Income-related benefits
are focused even more on low-income households. About 86 per cent goes to
those in the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution.
However, more precise targeting has meant a small increase - to 845,000
households - in the numbers who lose more than 70 per cent of each
additional pound of income. This happens where the withdrawal of benefits
coincides with the start of income tax to produce high marginal net
deductions.
Spending on social security will account for 28 per cent of public spending
next year and will rise from Pounds 82bn this year to Pounds 92bn in
1996-97.
An increasing proportion of social security is financed out of general
taxation, which provides more than half the income for benefits. Employers'
National Insurance contributions provide a quarter of the budget and
employees' contributions about a fifth.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Banks may be held liable for pollution clean-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks could be held liable for cleaning up pollution caused by companies to
which they have made loans, under government proposals published yesterday.
The consultation paper from the Department of the Environment and the Welsh
Office suggests that a fund of millions of pounds might also be needed to
cover pollution costs where no person or organisation could be held liable.
But it stresses that the UK wants to avoid the problems faced by the US's
Superfund, which has seen clean-up costs outstripping its budget.
The report tackles questions about who should pay to clean up contaminated
land, and how clean it should be.
It recommends that land needs to be cleaned only to the extent of being
'suitable for use', not to its original state of cleanliness.
Ms Clare Deanesly of Gouldens, the solicitors, said yesterday: 'The question
that is really up in the air is liability for pollution that occurred in the
past. There has been a lot of buck-passing between the public and private
sectors.'
The legal problems were highlighted in December in a court battle between
Eastern Counties Leather and Cambridge Water over liability for water
pollution.
Last year the government scrapped plans for a register of contaminated land,
part of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, because of fears that it
would cause property blight and would place too great a financial burden on
local authorities.
Ministers are concerned that the legal uncertainties are preventing
companies from securing loans and insurance, and making it preferable to
develop greenfield sites rather than old industrial blackspots.
The new proposals were attacked last night by banks, property companies and
environmentalists. Ms Hilary Thompson, head of the environmental unit at
National Westminster Bank, called for details of the banks' possible
exposure to be clarified.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: 'Our disappointment is
that, after a year-long review, the government's recommendations remain so
tentative.'
Responses to the paper are due by May 3.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Government split over control of education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A split between the prime minister's office and the Department of Education
opened yesterday over future local government control of education.
Mr Graham Bright, parliamentary private secretary to Mr John Major, appeared
to tell his local county council in a letter that local government
re-organisation in England would mean the abolition of local education
authorities.
He said: 'I very much hope that Bedfordshire County Council will recognise
that the introduction of grant-maintained status for schools is permanent
and that its own imminent demise signals the end for local education
authorities.'
But the education department said that it had no plans to abolish local
education authorities 'in the lifetime of this parliament'. Local government
re-organisation is due to take place in 1995 and 1996, before the next
general election is due.
Education ministers have, however, strongly encouraged schools to opt out of
local authority control, and instead take their funding directly from
Whitehall.
Labour seized on Mr Bright's comments as an admission of a Tory 'hidden
agenda'. Education is a county responsibility in non-metropolitan England,
and counties are due to be split into smaller all-purpose authorities under
the government's guidance to the Local Government Commission. It had been
assumed that the new unitary councils would inherit responsibility for
education, the largest single item of local government spending.
County education officers oppose re-organisation, saying that it would
weaken services.
Mr Bright attacked 'the re-creation of the old local authority empire over
schools', saying this would favour 'the most hidebound vested interests in
education'.
Bedfordshire, which has no overall political control, said that 13 of the
county's schools had opted out, while 277 remained in county control. It
added that Mr Bright appeared to have prejudged the outcome of the review,
which could still, under government guidelines, recommend that the two-tier
system continue.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the comments were 'a
mixture of admission of the government's hidden agenda, and a sign of
desperation that the grant-maintained schools are not catching on in
anything like the way the government intended'.
She added that the practical problems of abolishing local education
authorities would be too great, as the government would not be able to run
schools in the country.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Prisoners involved in benefits fraud to be traced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steps are being taken to trace prisoners involved in an alleged
multi-million pound benefits fraud. A report on BBC's Here and Now programme
says up to 4,000 prisoners are claiming benefits - at an annual cost of
Pounds 9m to Pounds 25m. The Department of Social Security said it believed
the programme exaggerates the fraud but confirmed that the Prison Service
gave the DSS details of all 35,000 convicted inmates in prison last week.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Labour attacks cuts in criminal injury awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was forced on to the defensive yesterday by Labour attacks on
plans to speed up the criminal injuries compensation scheme.
Mr John Major defended the government's plans to replace individual
assesments with a tariff scheme during irritable question time exchanges.
The prime minister said the changes, which will take effect in April, would
make the system more efficient and speed up payments to claimants. But it
later emerged that the changes would reduce the annual bill for compensation
payments from about Pounds 500m a year to Pounds 250m by the end of the
decade.
The government expects 46 per cent of claimants to be worse off under the
new system, which will replace individual assessment with fixed payments.
The proposals have been criticised in both houses of parliament, and there
is growing unrest among Conservative backbenchers about the impact on the
victims of crime.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, sought to exploit Tory unease by claiming that
compensation for police officers seriously injured in criminal attacks would
fall from Pounds 121,000 to Pounds 7,500. He said that a young woman with
two children who saw her husband murdered at her own front door had received
Pounds 137,000 under the existing scheme, but would have received only
Pounds 17,000 after April.
'Why should she lose Pounds 120,000 under a government cost-cutting
exercise?' he asked. 'Is it not bad enough that crime has doubled under this
government without making the victims pay for it?'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Fourth mobile phone network to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hutchison Microtel yesterday confirmed that it would be launching a cellular
mobile network next month and announced that it would be called 'Orange'.
The network will be the UK's fourth, competing against Vodafone, Cellnet and
Mercury One-2-One, which was launched within the M25 area last September.
Microtel chose the name in an effort to conjure up the image of cellular
communications as 'fresh, attractive, and not impossibly complicated to
use'.
Microtel, whose largest shareholder is Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong
conglomerate, refused to disclose the Orange tariffs yesterday, but said
they would be 'highly competitive' with those of existing networks.
The launch of One-2-One last year, with free local calls on weekday evenings
and at weekends, is widely credited with ensuring the breakthrough of
cellular mobile telephony into the consumer market.
The Orange network is based on the same technology as One-2-One, but it will
be more extensive at launch. It will cover more than half of the UK's
population initially, extending to 90 per cent by mid-1995.
One-2-One's network is limited to south-east England, although it is being
ex-panded.
The Orange network will be digital, as is One-2-One. The handsets are likely
to be more expensive than those for the analogue networks run by Vodafone
and Cellnet, but Orange is likely to compensate with cheaper operating
charges.
There has been much speculation that Hutchison Whampoa has tried to sell
Microtel, in which it has invested more than Pounds 700m.
Last year the conglomerate announced its intention to reduce its
telecommunications operations outside Hong Kong, and closed its unsuccessful
Rabbit telepoint venture in the UK.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Canal paths used for fibre-optic grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition for long-distance telecommunications traffic was stepped up
yesterday by the launch of a company using Britain's canal tow-paths to
build a fibre-optic network.
Fibreway says it is the first company engaged solely in the wholesaling of
capacity to other operators. It will offer no services directly to
end-users, but will sell capacity to the growing array of entrants to the UK
market.
Construction of a link between Edinburgh and Glasgow is under way, with
others planned in the Midlands. With more than 2,000 miles of canal
available, the potential exists to create a network linking most of the UK's
biggest cities. The three existing long-distance networks are owned by
companies which also provide telecoms services to consumers. They are
British Telecommunications, Mercury, and Energis, which will launch a
service next month.
Fibreway's largest shareholder is GPT, the telecoms equipment joint venture
between GEC and Siemens, the German group. It is acting in partnership with
British Waterways. Mr Gerry Boothroyd, Fibreway's director, said that
initial investment would be in the 'tens of millions', with network
construction determined by demand.
Cable companies building local networks in urban areas are keen to see a
diversity of long-distance operators.
Mr Eugene Connell, head of UK operations for Nynex, the US group making
significant UK cable investments, expressed 'serious interest' in the new
operator as a means of linking Nynex's franchises in different parts of the
country.
The idea of using canal tow-paths for a telecoms network has been in the air
for several years, but appeared to founder two years ago when Sprint, the US
long-distance carrier, dropped plans to build its own UK network.
The railways are already used for telecoms. Part of Mercury's long-distance
network runs alongside the tracks, and British Rail's own telecoms
subsidiary is preparing to offer a service to outside operators.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Fowler plays Euro defence card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party is putting defence firmly at the heart of its
campaign for the European elections in June.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, yesterday launched a sweeping attack bracketing both main
opposition parties together for the purposes of the assault.
With a strong Liberal Democrat challenge expected in Tory seats in the
south-west of England - a region in which the defence industry is one of the
largest employers - many of yesterday's most vituperative comments were
aimed at Mr Paddy Ashdown's party.
The two Tory politicians also used a Westminster press conference to launch
a 25-page document setting out the principal differences on defence between
all three leading parties.
The main thrust of Sir Norman's attack was to try to tar Labour and the
Liberal Democrats with the same brush by claiming that there was a
latter-day 'Lib-Lab pact' on defence.
This consisted of a three-part plan comprising 'drastic' defence cuts, the
surrender of control over Britain's security policy to Brussels and the
creation of a European army. 'On defence Labour and the Liberals have the
same agenda,' he said.
Mr Rifkind attacked the 'brave captain Ashdown' who liked to wrap himself in
the union flag and present himself as a great warrior but had appeared on
CND platforms 'not all that long ago'.
In a development which may disconcert Tory backbenchers who have complained
that recent defence cuts were Treasury-driven, there was a strong emphasis
on good housekeeping in yesterday's document.
'It remains incumbent upon the Ministry of Defence to deliver the nation's
required war fighting capability at least cost to the taxpayer,' the
document says.
One of the chief justifications for Nato remaining the cornerstone of
Britain's defence policy is that otherwise 'we would have to spend more to
achieve the level of security we have now'.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, described the press conference as
'a panic reaction by a government that has grossly mismanaged Britain's
defences'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Spate of TV mergers attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission's chief executive last night attacked
the recent spate of takeovers in ITV and suggested that they were driven
more by ambition than commercial considerations.
Mr David Glencross said in a hard-hitting speech to the Royal Television
Society that the advantages of size were not as clear-cut as often claimed.
He was speaking as MAI's bid for Anglia Television went unconditional and
after Carlton Communications's takeover of Central and Granada's successful
hostile bid for London Weekend Television.
Some time and expense would be saved by simplifying decision-taking in ITV
but, he said, takeovers were driven by three factors. 'In order of priority
they are ambition, ambition and ambition.' He added that already nearly
Pounds 50m had been spent in servicing the deals.
Even the newly enlarged ITV companies were small by international standards
and it was a misconception to think size by itself would create a thriving
programme export business.
Mr Glencross said: 'There is nothing to stop a consortium of the ITV
companies, and the BBC too, if it wishes, getting together to produce for
the export market without any change in the ownership rules.'
The government decision to allow larger ITV companies to be taken over by
each other had 'added to, rather than resolved the uncertainty about the
future of ITV'. Smaller companies could be left dangerously exposed.
Mr Glencross criticised the 1990 Broadcasting Act for making the ITV
companies the most taxed television companies in the world. Last year Pounds
360m, a quarter of ITV's advertising and sponsorship revenue, went to the
Treasury, almost as much as the total revenue of Channel 4.
He added: 'So in effect the cost of an entire national television channel is
being handed to the Treasury in addition to the normal corporation tax paid
by the Channel 3 companies.'
The ITC chief executive also said that:
Newspaper stakes in ITV should be able to rise from 20 per cent to 30 per
cent but that limit should be applied by stages to satellite groups such as
British Sky Broadcasting, half-owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation.
A new Channel 5 could start within two years without inhibiting the launch
of digital services.

FT  09 MAR 94 / From sop to soap-opera success: The S4C channel's rise to
Oscar contender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its early days so few people watched S4C, the Welsh fourth channel, the
joke was that it would have been been cheaper to give Welsh speakers free
video recorders.
More than a decade later all that has changed. The television channel that
was seen as a political sop to the Welsh nationalists has not only found an
audience and helped to stimulate a television and film production industry,
but even has a seat at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles later this month.
The Welsh-language film Hedd Wyn, the story of a poet from Trawsfynydd and
his death in the trenches during the first world war, is one of five
nominations for the foreign film Oscar.
S4C commissioned and paid for the Pounds 700,000 film, which has already won
a Royal Television Society award for best UK drama.
'I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I may go out with an Oscar,' says Mr
Geraint Stanley Jones, who retires at the end of next month after five years
running the channel.
'What it means is that finally there's a recognition that small could be
quite good actually and that a funny language may not be that restrictive,'
says the S4C chief executive who was formerly the BBC's first managing
director of regional programmes.
Recently S4C has migrated from Wales to BBC 2 with its Welsh language soap
opera Pobol Y Cwm - People of the Valleys. The popular drama, complete with
English sub-titles, has been getting afternoon audiences of about 600,000.
With the original S4C viewing attracting audiences of about 250,000, 1m
viewers for Pobol Y Cwm might be possible in future.
The channel broadcasts 32 hours a week in Welsh, although a growing
percentage of Welsh-language programmes carry English sub-titles. The rest
of the time S4C reschedules popular Channel 4 programmes such as Brookside
and The Big Breakfast.
Placing more emphasis on drama and English sub-titles has resulted in
increased ratings. In November 1988 the top 10 Welsh-language programmes
averaged 74,700 viewers each. By November 1992 this figure had risen to
125,600 and by last November to 202,700.
S4C is now funded by a 3.2 per cent share of non-satellite advertising
revenue - which includes income from the breakfast franchise and Channel 4 -
paid in the form of a block grant from the Treasury via the Department of
National Heritage. Last year this accounted for Pounds 55.7m. The channel is
also free to sell its own advertising and is expected to raise Pounds 6m
this year.
It also expects Pounds 10m in co-production money - S4C has made programmes
with broadcasters as diverse as ZDF of Germany, ABC of Australia and
Fujisanki of Japan, with a particular emphasis on animation.
The animated tales of Shakespeare sold to 50 countries and the station is
working on a multi-million pound animation of the Old Testament with
Christmas Films of Moscow.
As Mr Stanley Jones hands over to the new chief executive Mr Huw Jones, a
leading Welsh independent producer, it seems a very reasonable legacy for a
channel born after Mr Gwynfor Evans, president of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh
nationalist party, threatened to go on hunger strike if one was not created.

Two leading organisations representing the advertising industry have called

effect monopolies developing, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and the Association of Media
Independents have told the Independent Television Commission they would
accept one sales point being responsible for up to 25 per cent of all
television advertising in the UK - but only with conditions.
The ITC is looking at its rules governing the sale of television advertising
with the presumption that the maximum threshold will be lifted from 25 per
cent of ITV to 25 per cent of all television sales.
If that happens the IPA wants to see a prohibition on advertising being sold
in a package for two or more competing television services such as regional
ITV companies, GMTV, the breakfast service, Channel 4 or the two London ITV
stations. The institute also wants to see a ban on any advertising sales
points with 25 per cent of the market having shareholdings in, or influence
over, a competitor.
The media independents want a sales structure 'which is independent,
accountable and transparent'.
The institute wants any sales organisation with more than 20 per cent of the
market to be a separate legal entity with independent directors, and to
declare net quarterly revenue to clear criteria.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Lib Dems target urban Tory seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday outlined plans to target urban Conservative
seats in an attempt to establish the party as the main metropolitan
alternative to Labour in the May local government elections.
Launching a paper on urban policy Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat
leader, said Britain's rundown cities could be regenerated through
decentralisation and wider council powers over taxation and planning.
The paper, Reclaiming the City, aims to build on the Liberal Democrat's
successes in last year's county council elections, when the party made
widespread gains at the expense of the Tories. It attacks the government for
imposing undemocratic quangos on local government and 'failing either to
arrest the underlying processes of urban decay or to ameliorate the
effects'.
Mr Ashdown said the paper was intended to challenge the public view of the
Liberal Democrats as a rural party of the south-west of England, Scotland
and Wales.
'Up and down the country we are moving away from being a party exclusively
winning seats in rural areas and one which is becoming an inner-city
alternative to the Labour party,' he said.
The paper is based on the Liberal Democrats' long-standing commitment to
decentralise local government under a new tier of regional assemblies for
Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
It calls for lower business rates; local agencies to mobilise savings and
channel national and European funds into development projects; tax relief
for municipal development bonds; and workforce agreements to ensure that
local people benefit directly from jobs created by redevelopment projects.
It also urges the use of planning law to direct businesses and homes back to
inner-city areas, combined with a development tax to discourage development
on greenfield sites.
The paper also calls for a substantial increase in light rail and other
public transport systems.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Economic indicator's rise ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading index has
ended, new data showed yesterday. The index is designed to detect turning
points in the economy about a year in advance.
The index, whose components include the yield curve, building starts, the
financial balances of industrial and commercial companies and business
optimism, is now flat. This is mainly due to a large downward revision to
December's housebuilding figures.
However, the shorter leading index - intended to highlight changes in
activity about five months ahead using share prices, car registrations and
the Gallup index of consumer confidence - continued its 15-month rise.
The coincident indicator, which tracks the business cycle, has risen
steadily from its trough in the second quarter of 1992. All its components -
including GDP at factor cost, industrial production, retail sales and M0
money supply - have contributed this year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Scottish exports up 30% in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exports of manufactured goods from Scotland rose by more than 30 per cent in
value last year, says a new index of Scottish exports, James Buxton writes.
The index, based on figures from 26 companies which account for 60 per cent
of all Scottish exports, rose from its base of 100 in the first quarter to
130.1 for the fourth quarter, suggesting exports worth Pounds 10.9bn in the
whole of 1993. Although all industrial sectors showed growth, the strongest
export sector was computers.
The index is compiled by Scottish Council Development and Industry, which
lobbies for economic development.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Oftel imposes tighter regime on BT charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications faces a sharp increase in regulation as Oftel,
the telecommunications watchdog, tries to open the UK market to greater
competition.
A new supervisory regime announced yesterday by Oftel will provide for the
regulator to set and publish the price of more than 70 charges levied by BT
on competitors needing to use its network to carry their calls.
It will also force BT to publish separate accounts for its network and
retail businesses to reduce the advantage the company gains as a retailer
from owning the country's largest telecoms network.
Payments to BT, which controls about 90 per cent of the UK telecoms market,
represent about half of the total costs of rival operators.
The largest rival is Mercury, but dozens of new operators have gained
licences in the past two years, including cable companies build-ing combined
television and telephone networks in urban areas.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said the changes were essential
to promote a transparent, competitive telecoms market. He said: 'I hope BT
will increasingly see other operators as customers as well as competitors.'
BT views new operators solely as a threat, however, and is anxious to avoid
becoming little more than a wholesaler of network capacity to other service
providers.
At present it sets charges for competitors using its network by negotiation,
with a right of appeal to Oftel - exercised twice by Mercury. The prices
have been confidential and vary between operators.
In future, competitors will pay for key interconnection services at
standard, published tariffs set by Oftel.
BT condemned Oftel's 'costly increase in regulation'. But Mr Michael Hepher,
BT managing director, has assured Oftel of co-operation in the introduction
of accounting separation, which will apply from this financial year.
Mr Cruickshank said the level of detailed regulation proposed was
'absolutely essential' to develop competition. He added: 'BT is presently
not offering the same price for the same thing to competitors and it is not
demonstrating to operators how prices are reached.'
Oftel's standard interconnection charges will initially be based on its
determination last year of the long-running dispute between BT and Mercury
over network payments.
Mercury is contesting the determination in the High Court in an attempt to
secure a more favourable settlement. Mr Cruickshank made no further
concessions to Mercury yesterday but repeated his intention to examine its
proposals as a medium-term option.
Mr Richard Woollam, director-general of the Cable Television Association,
said Oftel's plans were 'roughly in line with what we have been looking
for'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Malaysia still cool after Prior visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Malaysian officials have warned that it may take some time for
Britain to improve relations. This is in spite of attempts by leading
British business figures to persuade Kuala Lumpur to lift an order banning
UK companies from participating in new government contracts.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, yesterday had a lengthy
meeting with Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and a former British cabinet
minister.
Although British diplomats in Kuala Lumpur stressed that Lord Prior's
secretive two-day visit to Malaysia was private, a senior official in London
said the mission 'had the blessing of Downing Street'.
Lord Prior was believed to be on his way back to London last night and is
expected to report to Mr John Major today on his meeting with Dr Mahathir.
Sir Charles Powell, a director of Trafalgar House and former foreign affairs
adviser to Mr Major and Baroness Thatcher, has also been in Malaysia.
GEC is among the British companies hardest hit by the Malaysian ban.
Together with Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty, it is part of an
Anglo-Japanese consortium which had been hoping to carry out a large part of
the work on a new Pounds 3bn international airport outside Kuala Lumpur. GEC
has also sold defence equipment to Malaysia under the controversial 1988
memorandum of understanding between the two countries.
Malaysian officials privately admit that Dr Mahathir is unlikely to take any
quick decision to rescind his government's order against British companies.
It is felt that Dr Mahathir wants a more outspoken condemnation from Downing
Street of reports in the British media - in particular a report in The
Sunday Times - alleging that he and other members of the Malaysian
government had been involved in seeking under-the-table payments from a
British company.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Heseltine rejects role as next Tory chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine has dismissed suggestions from prominent Tory MPs that
he should take over as Conservative party chairman after the government's
expected defeats in local and European elections this summer.
His determination to stay at the Department of Trade and Industry emerged as
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, failed to dispel speculation that he and
Mr Heseltine are preparing for a leadership contest later this year.
Mr Clarke insisted during a series of interviews yesterday that he expected
Mr John Major to lead the Conservatives into the general election due by
1997. That echoed Mr Major's public reaffirmation earlier this week of his
determination to hold on to the premiership.
But the chancellor, who said he was fed up with being quizzed about the
leadership, again admitted his long-term ambitions to become prime minister.
That and a couple of verbal slips suggesting that Mr Major's position was
not entirely secure were seen at Westminster as evidence that Mr Clarke is
anxious to keep open his options in the event of an early leadership crisis.
Mr Heseltine has told close friends that he wants to remain in his present
post when Mr Major unveils his expected cabinet reshuffle after the summer
elections. He has not received any indication from 10 Downing Street that
the prime minister will seek to move him.
The speculation that Mr Major might ask Mr Heseltine to lead the
Conservatives' campaign for the next general election has been fanned by
intense suspicion on the right of the Tory party that he is positioning
himself for a leadership bid.
Prominent rightwing Tory MPs have been openly canvassing the idea that by
making him party chairman Mr Major could ensure Mr Heseltine's loyalty if
bad results in the local and European polls trigger a leadership crisis.
Sir Norman Fowler, the present chairman, has already indicated his plan to
stand down and the MPs have suggested that Mr Heseltine would find it
impossible to turn down the job without appearing disloyal.
But friends of Mr Heseltine have dismissed as nonsense any suggestion that
he would pose a threat to the prime minister if he remained at the DTI.
The trade and industry secretary has made it clear that he has always
regarded his task of reshaping the government's approach to industry as one
that would take at least three years and probably longer.
Mr Heseltine's unwillingness to countenance a move leaves Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, as the clear favourite for the party chairmanship.

Andrew Jack writes.
The institute's financial reporting and auditing group called instead for a

It also called for company accounts to include an internal control statement

FT  09 MAR 94 / Employers face Pounds 55m maternity pay bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The additional Pounds 55m a year cost of improved maternity payments, which
will benefit about 285,000 working women, will be met by employers, the
government said yesterday.
The announcement follows a government consultation which set out options for
adapting UK maternity benefits to meet European Union directive
requirements.
The new system, which must be in place by October 16, simplifies current
benefits which give different rates of maternity pay depending on whether a
women has worked 26 weeks, two years or five years in the same job.
In future, any woman who has been employed in the same job for 26 weeks or
more will be entitled to statutory maternity pay. This will be 90 per cent
of earnings for all recipients for the first six weeks and Pounds 52.50 for
the remaining 12 weeks.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said in a Commons written reply
that the additional cost would be covered by reducing employers'
reimbursements for statutory maternity pay to 92 per cent from September 4
this year.
Small employers would continue to be fully reimbursed.
'As a whole employers will not be out of pocket,' said Mr Lilley. This was
because the reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions
announced in the Budget would more than compensate them.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Ministers' lies to MPs defended by Waldegrave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, yesterday rekindled the
controversy over ministerial accountability raised by the arms-for-Iraq
affair when he appeared to defend lying to parliament.
Mr Waldegrave told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that
ministers could be justified in 'very, very exceptional cases in saying
something that was untrue'. He added: 'Everyone accepts that.'
Mr Waldegrave said: 'Much of government activity is more like playing poker
than chess. You don't lay all your cards on the table.'
Mr Waldegrave's admission followed questioning over evidence given by Sir
Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, to the Scott inquiry, which is
investigating the sale of arms to Iraq.
Sir Robin told the inquiry that giving incomplete answers to parliament was
frequently necessary. He added, however, that half-answers should not
mislead MPs other than in 'the most exceptional circumstances . . . like the
devaluation case'.
Mr Waldegrave repeated this formulation to the committee, and added that
ministers often could not tell the House all that they knew, 'especially in
relation to diplomatic matters'. He pointed out that parliament had appeared
to accept that it was right for the government not to reveal everything that
it was doing in order to bring peace to Northern Ireland.
Committee members expressed surprise at Mr Waldegrave's robust defence of
the practice. Mr Giles Radice, the committee's chairman, said that it was 'a
remarkable statement for a minister'.
Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, said the Commons had
on occasion accepted that ministers had to lie in the national interest. He
added, however, that it was the usual practice for a minister to offer his
resignation afterwards.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow Citizen's Charter minister, called on the prime
minister to repudiate Mr Waldegrave's 'accommodation with dishonesty'.
He said: 'Trust and credibility are at the heart of democracy. If this
dangerous and highly damaging doctrine were once accepted, confidence in
ministers, already at the lowest ebb since the war, would completely
collapse.'
Mr Waldegrave told Channel 4 news that he was 'astonished' by the storm
raised by his remarks, which were directed solely at the 'exceptional' case
of an impending devaluation.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Dartford bridge likely to pay for itself by 2001
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dartford bridge, the first project to be completed under the
government's initiative for private funding of transport links, is expected
to pay for itself by the year 2001, seven years ahead of schedule.
More than 37m vehicles used the crossing last year, generating income from
tolls of Pounds 41m, the Department of Transport said yesterday. The bridge,
which carries the M25 motorway across the Thames east of London, was
completed a little over two years ago for Pounds 86m.
Mr Robert Key, transport minister, said the success of the Dartford
crossing, officially called the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, showed the value
of the government's private-finance initiative.
However, other attempts to bring private finance into infrastructure
projects have been blamed for delays in getting work under way.
The Dartford bridge was built and financed by a consortium consisting of
Trafalgar House, the construction company, merchant bank Kleinwort Benson,
Bank of America and the Prudential insurance company. They were awarded a
concession to collect tolls for up to 20 years.
Once the consortium breaks even on the bridge, ownership will transfer to
the government, which may then levy tolls for one year. If it wants to
continue tolls for longer it must seek parliamentary approval, although the
transport department hopes to introduce tolls on the entire motorway network
from 1998.
The British Road Federation said the bridge had ended congestion on the
river crossing but it owed much of its success to a lack of alternative
bridges or tunnels east of London.
The Automobile Association said motorists would be surprised the tolls had
been set at a level allowing such prompt repayment of the bridge's debts. It
called for the tolls to be dropped when the bridge reverted to public
ownership.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Spy chief seeks Scott secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Spedding, Britain's new spy chief, is prepared to give evidence to
the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry but only if all members of the intelligence
services can continue to testify in camera.
Mr Spedding, who was last week named as the next head of MI6, owes his
promotion largely to his involvement in gathering information on Iraq's
nuclear programme. He is thus well placed to shed light on an area which has
been investigated by Lord Justice Scott and which includes the work done for
UK intelligence by former executives of Matrix Churchill.
A Scott inquiry spokesman said last night that the judge was not prepared to
comment on intelligence witnesses to his inquiry. The judge has already
taken written and oral evidence in private from several members of the
intelligence services, including some members of Mr Spedding's section
specialising in the Middle East and Sir Colin McColl, the outgoing head of
MI6.
After consultations with Whitehall officials, Lord Justice Scott decided
that the public interest in hearing evidence from an intelligence officer
was outweighed by the public interest in protecting his identity and some of
the information provided by him.
According to intelligence sources Mr Spedding is under instructions, 'like
any other member of Whitehall', to co-operate fully with the Scott inquiry.
This would include giving evidence in public if 'requested to do so by Lord
Justice Scott'. Mr Spedding believes, however, that evidence in camera best
serves a balance between a higher public profile for the service and the
continuing demand for secrecy in its operations.
The role of the intelligence services is expected to come under renewed
focus today when Mr Peter Wiltshire, a Customs officer involved in the
Matrix Churchill investigation, gives evidence to the inquiry.
The intelligence services are confident they have nothing to fear from the
inquiry. They believe the judge's report will largely exonerate those
involved in intelligence reporting and instead criticise a breakdown in
dissemination of information by non-intelligence officials and ministers.
The judge has been provided with numerous intelligence reports warning
Whitehall that Iraq was using British exports, mainly machine-tools, to
build up Iraqi conventional and nuclear capability from the mid-1980s.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Cadbury auditing proposal attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday
attacked a central recommendation of the Cadbury committee on corporate
governance that companies should report publicly on internal controls.
The institute's financial reporting and auditing group called instead for a
much reduced statement in companies' annual reports and a separate private
report from auditors to audit committees.
A Cadbury committee working group, which includes institute representatives,
is developing revised proposals on reporting on internal controls. An
earlier draft of its recommended guidance was widely criticised for being
too lengthy and impractical to implement, and the institute's statement
could prove another setback to the group's work.
Yesterday's report called for company accounts to include an internal
control statement by directors and a declaration that their responsibilities
have been met.
In a previous provocative statement last week, which put it at loggerheads
with the Auditing Practices Board, the institute's auditing committee argued
that guidance by the board on whether a company was a 'going concern' raised
a number of problems with which it could not agree.
These included the need for an accounting standard and the time into the
future over which auditors could provide reassurance.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Central America's 'model' accord - An
'advanced' trade deal between Mexico and Costa Rica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The free trade agreement that Mexico and Costa Rica provisionally concluded
last week has been described as the most advanced between two Latin American
countries.
It will eventually remove tariff and most non-tariff barriers to trade in
goods and services between the two countries; offer national treatment to
investors from each country; set rules on intellectual property rights; ease
movement of workers between the two countries; and provide for a panel that
resolves disputes arising out of compliance with the accord.
Both countries predicted that the agreement would significantly boost
Mexican-Costa Rican trade, which stood at Dollars 215m (Pounds 147.2m) last
year.
However, by giving preferential access to each other's markets, the
agreements will hurt the two countries' existing trade partners, especially
other central American states.
The negotiations were formally wrapped up last Thursday night, and the text
is being written up by lawyers. Mexico's Trade Ministry expects the
agreement to be ready in four to six weeks and to be signed by the
respective presidents soon after.
The treaty will take effect from January 1 next year. Mexico's Trade
Ministry said Mexican exports of goods that Costa Rica did not produce would
be able to enter Costa Rica duty-free from next year. This covers about 80
per cent of Mexican exports, currently at tariffs of about 20 per cent.
Tariffs on the remainder of Mexican exports will be reduced over five, 10
and - for the most sensitive products - 15 years. Mexico in turn will allow
a majority of Costa Rican exports to enter duty-free in five years or less.
Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, said the agreement was '. . .
without a doubt, one of the most advanced trade agreements between any Latin
American countries'.
He said the pact established 'a strong rule of origin that requires goods to
be made with inputs of the region; that is to say from Costa Rica or Mexico,
and that this is an important opportunity for Mexican suppliers of inputs
and primary materials, since Costa Rica's supply industry is not well
advanced'.
Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's trade minister, described the pact as the
first step toward Costa Rica's accession to the North American Free Trade
Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada.
An official from Mexico's Trade Ministry said products would have to contain
50 per cent regional content to be considered Costa Rican or Mexican and
free of tariffs. As Mr Serra Puche made clear, such a rule of origin would
encourage Costa Rican companies that export to Mexico to source from Mexico
rather than neighbouring countries.
'What this accord is promoting is alliances and not competition between
Mexico and Costa Rica,' said the official. 'What we are looking for is that
Costa Rican and Mexican businessmen work together.'
This is the latest of a series of trade agreements in Latin America. Trade
experts from the region meeting in Santiago last week were warned in a
report from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America that there were
risks in such agreements, in particular bilateral ones.
It said the benefits of such deals 'were fewer when integration agreements
involve countries that are only minor trading partners'. It argued there was
a 'possibility that bilateral (or even broader) integration agreements
signed within the region might have restrictive effects'.
With low tariffs such as those that prevail in Latin America, the benefits
of such trade agreements were fewer, it said, and the accords could include
other aspects - such as rules of origin - that might discourage trade rather
than promote it.
It further suggested that the emergence of certain 'hub' countries, with
which most bilateral agreements were concluded, 'can also create incentives
for the polarisation of investment in these countries'.
Mr Serra Puche hoped the agreement with Costa Rica would provide a model for
similar accords between Mexico and remaining central American countries,
over which negotiations were continuing.
Mexico's trade minister expects to meet this month with counterparts from
Colombia and Venezuela to discuss their free trade agreement. The three
countries had hoped to sign the treaty in January before President Rafael
Caldera of Venezuela took office. Although Mexico claimed in December that
negotiations had concluded, last-minute differences over rules or origin for
chemicals and textiles made signing impossible, however.
The new Venezuelan government, less keen on free trade than its predecessor,
is said to have insisted on a re-negotiation of the treaty. The Mexican
government is willing to meet the Venezuelans and listen to their concerns,
but the Trade Ministry official said the agreement could not be re-opened.

Mercedes-Benz is to start assembling E-Class executive cars and
manufacturing vehicle engines in India in a new joint venture with its
long-standing partner, Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco) of Bombay.
The partners will invest DM250m (Pounds 97.2m) in equipping a factory in
Poona with capacity for 20,000 cars and 50,000 petrol and diesel engines a
year.
Car assembly will start this year, while engine output is scheduled to begin
in 1995, Daimler-Benz, the Mercedes parent, said yesterday.
Mercedes will hold a 51 per cent stake in a new operating company,
Mercedes-Benz India, which will further tighten ties with Telco, in which
Daimler has a 10 per cent stake.
The two groups have co-operated since 1954, when Telco was awarded its first
licences to manufacture Mercedes commercial vehicles under licence.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US losing hope as tariff rows continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US trade officials are losing hope for any significant gains in the final
drive to negotiate tariff cuts in the Uruguay Round beyond those agreed last
December 15.
Countries taking part in the Uruguay Round of trade-liberalising talks are
still wrangling over the details of individual tariff schedules, three weeks
after the negotiations should have finished.
With the signing of the Round set for April 15 in Marrakesh, the
negotiations have entered the 'verification stage' on tariffs, which is
supposed to address only technical changes.
However, the US, Japan, EU and Canada - the so-called Quad countries -
continue to wrangle over tariff cuts on wood, white spirits, copper, and
aluminum. The only deal in sight is a cut in Japan's copper tariffs to the
equivalent of 5 per cent.
Trade officials in Geneva said yesterday that talks, mostly bilateral, were
continuing to try to sort out remaining differences. These mainly concern
items where tariff concessions shown in the submitted schedules do not match
what countries thought they had achieved in earlier negotiations.
More than 60 schedules have been submitted, with 22 still outstanding. Least
developed countries are not obliged to submit schedules at this stage.
A US official said Japan and the EU had continued to block progress by
refusing to cut their most sensitive tariffs. March 25, the date set by the
Gatt secretariat as the deadline for submission of final tariff schedules,
is now seen as the final deadline for the market access talks.
Progress on wood, particularly, would be 'a good thing' for US-Japan
relations, the official said. A 50 per cent reduction over five years has
been agreed, but that will still leave Japanese wood tariffs at 6 per cent.
The US industry has even joined the fray, buying advertisements in Japanese
newspapers claiming that a tariff phase-out would bring the cost of housing
down by 20 per cent.
At a meeting of negotiators yesterday in Geneva, convened to discuss the
schedules, Japan repeated complaints that the US had withdrawn earlier
offers on films, electronic products and non-ferrous metals. EU officials on
Monday expressed disappointment over US tariff reductions on copper and
trucks.
Japan is also unhappy about the EU's offer on televisions and video cameras,
while Indonesia and Malaysia have complained about the link between lower EU
wood tariffs and a lifting of their restrictions on export of raw logs.
Concern was voiced yesterday about a US 'headnote' in the textiles and
clothing section referring to Washington's intention to pursue talks with
some exporting nations, such as India and Pakistan, to reduce their import
barriers. The US stressed this was not being made a condition for tariff
reductions.
However, it urged US negotiators to pursue 'aggressively' further tariff
cuts to enhance 'significantly the economic benefits of the Uruguay Round'.
The meagre results of these final talks are a severe blow to US industry.
The influential Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, a
business and labour panel appointed by the president, said further tariff
cuts were vital.
The textile industry is even more insistent on progress. Mr Henry Truslow,
president of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute, threatened last
week to oppose the trade pact in Congress unless the US won 'critically
needed market access commitments from countries which today flood US markets
with their clothing and textile products'.
Although market opening offers have been received from Malaysia, Chile, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia, no tariff cut offer has been received from
Pakistan. India has offered small cuts, which US officials dismiss as
inadequate.
'Time is running out,' said Mr Truslow. 'We see no progress on making the
major offenders agree to open their markets.
'It is time for our government to take a stand and say the US will not phase
out its Multifibre Arrangement quotas for countries which keep their markets
closed.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean Basin countries increased the volume and value of apparel exported
to the US by a quarter last year, as a result of special agreements for
access and increased quotas. The region accounted for almost 14 per cent of
the US market.
The Caribbean's apparel exports to the US in 1993 totalled 12.3bn square
metres, 24 per cent more than in the previous year and well ahead of the 6
per cent increase in worldwide apparel exports to the US last year.
Earnings by Caribbean Basin countries from the US increased 23 per cent last
year to Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.67bn).
'The Caribbean Basin countries' share of the US apparel market grew to 13.74
per cent last year, compared to 14.9 per cent held by South East Asia's
Asean group, 4.15 per cent by the European Union, 2.24 per cent by Latin
America and 1.68 per cent by Africa,' said Mr Peter King, chairman of the
Caribbean's Textile and Apparel Institute.
'Some of the major product lines were knitted and woven shirts, trousers and
shorts, T-shirts, hosiery, underwear and foundation garments.'
Most of the region's apparel exports to the US are produced under the 807
offshore assembly programme which allows garments to be assembled in the
region from fabric made and cut in the US and re-exported to the US with
duty paid on the value added in assembly.
The main regional exporter to the US last year was the Dominican Republic
whose shipments increased by 18 per cent to earn Dollars 1.4bn. Costa Rica's
exports increased by 12 per cent to Dollars 650m, followed by Guatemala, up
2 per cent to Dollars 544m, Honduras up 43 per cent to Dollars 500m and
Jamaica up 31 per cent to Dollars 381m.
Mr King is forecasting another 25 per cent increase in volume and value of
regional apparel exports to the US this year, despite fears the Mexican
industry, using the North American Free Trade Agreement, could eat into
Caribbean markets.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Cool hand to guide Whitewater raft: Clinton hopes Cutler can
see him over political rapids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Democrats, both lawyers, stand in a league of their own as heavyweight
troubleshooters with enormous Washington reputations. One is Mr Robert
Strauss, now 75, at various times national party chairman, special trade
representative and ambassador to Moscow under President George Bush.
The other is Lloyd Norton Cutler, whose clout and access to the upper
reaches of government far exceed the governmental positions he has nominally
held during nearly 50 years in Washington.
Born in New York and a Yale Law School graduate like the president and Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton, this urbane, witty and charming man is a fixture on
the social circuit and in the political backrooms that used to be
smoke-filled.
His law firm, Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering, which he helped found in 1962,
is a star in the Washington legal firmament, its domestic and foreign
clients generally of the blue chip variety, its lawyers always in and out of
government.
Mr Cutler's personal and political briefs have long been at the cutting
edges of US domestic and foreign policy. He was active in the civil rights
movement and other liberal causes, a member of the 1968-70 Eisenhower
commission on the prevention and causes of violence, the unpaid co-ordinator
of President Jimmy Carter's attempts to get the Salt Two treaty ratified and
a frequent commentator on constitutional and ethical issues.
Earlier this year he was the principal lawyer in the case that successfully
overturned the Washington State law imposing term limits on elected
representatives. But, to combat political 'gridlock', he has also advocated
a constitutional amendment to co-ordinate the congressional and presidential
election cycles by giving House members four-year terms, not two, and
senators eight, rather than six.
But there is an unpredictable streak, too. In 1987 he offended many liberal
friends by coming to the defence of Mr Robert Bork, President Ronald
Reagan's conservative Supreme Court nominee ultimately rejected by the
Senate. In 1992, along with another Democratic eminence grise, Mr Paul
Nitze, he gave some advice to Mr Ross Perot prior to his independent
presidential candidacy.
His appointment as White House counsel is reminiscent of the circumstances
of August 1979. The Carter administration was already in trouble even before
the Iranian hostage crisis and its White House legal counsel, Mr Robert
Lipshutz, under fire for taking too narrow a legal view of his
responsibilities.
The same criticism is now levelled at the departing Mr Bernard Nussbaum,
whose resignation was announced at the weekend, and at the general White
House staff with its heavy component of friends of the president.
Last summer, when also under attack after a series of mishaps, Mr Clinton
reached into the Washington establishment to appoint Mr David Gergen,
denizen of Republican White Houses, as a senior adviser. The improvement in
presidential fortunes owed not a little to this move, although Mr Gergen is
now less visible and is frequently reported to be thinking of moving on.
Mr Cutler's second White House term will not be long either. He said
yesterday that he had agreed to stay only for 'a period of months'. He is
unlikely to last until Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel
investigating the Whitewater affair, produces his report next year or the
year after. But if he gets the White House show back on the road in the
meanwhile, he will have earned his stripes yet again.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday reached into the upper echelons of the
Washington establishment for assistance over the Whitewater affair by
appointing Mr Lloyd Cutler, the celebrated Democratic lawyer, as his new
White House legal counsel.
Mr Cutler, 76, who served in the same capacity in the troubled last year of
the Carter administration, said yesterday he would concentrate on
'procedures and actions necessary to maintain public confidence in the
integrity and openness of the presidency'.
The White House has said for several days it was looking for 'a Lloyd Cutler
type figure' of unquestioned stature to replace Mr Bernard Nussbaum, whose
resignation was announced last weekend.
Mr Cutler said he was supposed to be 'counsel to the president in office and
to the office of the presidency' but would not handle Mr Clinton's personal
affairs dating from before he took office.
News of the appointment did not deter Republicans insisting hearings be held
into allegations the White House has sought to obstruct investigations into
the Whitewater affair, which involves Mr and Mrs Clinton's land and
financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s.
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia said yesterday the legislature 'has an
independent obligation to investigate and to inform both itself and the
country'. Republicans have already threatened to hold up the nomination of
Ms Ricki Tigert to run the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if
Democrats refuse to agree to hearings.
Mr Gingrich also dismissed objections from Mr Robert Fiske, the independent
counsel probing Whitewater, who said hearings on Capitol Hill 'would pose a
severe risk' to the integrity of his inquiries.
Mr Fiske is mindful of the Iran-Contra precedent, where grants of immunity
from prosecution given by Congress as a pre-condition for testimony
ultimately resulted in the conviction on criminal charges of Oliver North
being overturned.
But Mr Jim Leach from Iowa, senior Republican on the House banking
committee, said there was no reason why anybody testifying over Whitewater
should be granted immunity. His committee already has plans to question
Treasury officials later this month.
The Democratic leadership in Congress, according to Mr Leach, is now on the
horns of a dilemma, not wanting to appear to obstruct the probe but also not
wanting to embarrass the president, orjeopardise his legislative programme.
Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House, has warned against the legal
complications that might follow hearings, but has not come out flatly
against them. Yesterday, Senator John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat,
speaking of the 'partisan setting' of Congress, said: 'We don't need
political hearings, we need legal hearings.'
Mr Clinton opened up one possible new avenue of inquiry on Monday when he
said he had been told last October that federal regulators wanted a criminal
investigation of Madison Guaranty, the Arkansas savings and loan institution
at the heart of the affair.
He insisted this information had been routinely passed on to him and was the
limit of his knowledge of contacts between the White House and other
departments. Yesterday Mr Clinton stoutly defended himself. 'I still haven't
been accused of doing anything wrong, because I have not done anything wrong
and I am not going to do anything wrong.'

<TEXT>
The former president of Venezuela's Banco Latino, taken over by the
government in January, says the bank was victimised for political reasons
and was in no worse shape than other banks the government has chosen to
save.
Mr Gustavo Gomez Lopez said the decision to intervene at the bank was made
by the country's previous government under President Ramon Velasquez 'more
for political than technical reasons'.
Latino, Venezuela's second biggest bank, was seen by Mr Velasquez' interim
government as having aided the political and personal fortunes of
ex-president Carlos Andres Perez, he added.
Mr Perez, forced to leave the presidency last year to face corruption
charges, had a long and close association with important shareholders of the
bank.
Mr Gomez, speaking by phone from an undisclosed location outside Venezuela,
said: 'The government intervened in my bank and I am now seen as a criminal.
But in the case of other Venezuelan banks suffering from liquidity problems,
the government is providing them with financial aid and is not prosecuting
anyone.
He admitted Banco Latino was in trouble, but 'it was no more problematic
than other Venezuelan banks. When I took over I raised capital and tried to
change the bank from what it had been.'
Mr Gomez, 43, resigned as president of Banco Latino in December after 18
years at the bank and 14 months as chief executive. He left Venezuela soon
after, he said, because friends warned him he would be a target of
persecution. 'I didn't want to be held in a police cellar incommunicado.
I'll return to Venezuela when the (political) climate changes'.
Last week, a criminal court judge in Caracas issued arrest warrants against
Mr Gomez and 82 others suspected of being involved in the downfall of the
bank. Latino's failure set off a crisis in Venezuela's financial system and
triggered a wave of frantic dollar purchases in January and February. Mr
Gomez, who said he is not guilty of any wrongdoing, is charged with illegal
appropriation, fraud, conspiracy and approving false financial statements.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Congress embarks on health bill draft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congress yesterday took its first tentative step towards putting together a
healthcare reform bill when a House of Representatives panel sat down to try
to draft legislation.
The subcommittee, a healthcare panel of the influential Ways and Means
Committee, is chaired by Congressman Pete Stark of California, whose own
proposal for reform is somewhat to the left of the plan put forward by
President Bill Clinton's administration.
Mr Stark wants to add a new category to the government-run Medicare
programme which now provides health insurance for the elderly, to cover both
the poor and unemployed, including those now included in the parallel
government Medicaid programme.
The new Medicare category would also be open to companies with up to 100
employees, who would, if they chose this option, have to pay 80 per cent of
the premium for their employees.
Controversially, Mr Stark also proposed yesterday a 0.8 per cent payroll tax
to raise Dollars 24bn a year, on top of the tobacco tax increase advocated
in the Clinton plan, to pay for some of the cost of expanding health
insurance to cover the entire US population.
While Mr Stark's proposal is seen by many members of Congress as redolent of
the kind of state-run medicine that provokes goosebumps among US doctors,
patients and politicians alike, its strength is that it is built on
Medicare, which is not only familiar but also generally popular among the
groups it serves.
Although the proposal differs in many respects from Mr Clinton's ideas,
which are based on health alliances to purchase insurance, White House
officials appeared happy that the Ways and Means subcommittee was at least
setting the legislative ball in motion.
Other subcommittees which have jurisdiction over parts of the healthcare
reform package have deadlocked, and the entire issue of reforming the system
has lost momentum.
Further complicating the task is the current preoccupation with the
WhiteWater financial affair, which has not only absorbed all the energies of
a good portion of the senior White House staff in recent days, but also cast
an unfavourable light on Mrs Hillary Clinton, who has been the
administration's principal spokesperson on health reform.
Mr Clinton yesterday expressed his optimism that a health care reform bill
will, in the end, pass the Congress.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Violence mars road to Colombia elections: The congressional
campaign trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If more elections and more contenders are a sign of greater democracy, then
Colombia is doing well. There are 928 slates of candidates registered for
congressional elections on Sunday, when the official Liberal party
presidential candidate will also be chosen.
However, at least 10 congressional candidates have been killed, kidnapped or
injured during the campaign. One sociologist calculates that elections in
more than half Colombia's municipalities are affected by guerrilla violence.
The proliferation of congressional lists seems to be more a measure of the
atomisation of the two main parties than of democratic vigour. In the
south-western department of Valle, for example, more than 25 Liberal groups
are competing for the 13 seats.
The power of the regional chiefs has broken down and the new voting card
makes it more difficult to buy votes than it was in the past. Even a young
political party such as M-19, the former guerrilla movement, is suffering
from disunity and presenting three slates in Valle.
Given that so many candidates are unknown and have little more than a slogan
for a programme, the Liberal party of current president Cesar Gaviria is
trying to capture voters with vague, feel-good publicity.
Abstention normally varies from about half to two thirds in Colombian
elections; this time the large number of investigations into congressmen's
misdoings and a widely held assumption that drug money helps fund many
campaigns have reinforced disillusionment with politics. However, the
Liberal party holds, and will probably retain, a comfortable majority in
both houses.
In the race for the Liberal party presidential candidacy, the winner is
virtually certain to be Mr Ernesto Samper, who is far ahead of his Liberal
rivals in the opinion polls. The first round of the presidential elections
will take place on May 8, followed by a second round on May 29 if no
candidate wins an outright majority.
Mr Samper has been on the campaign trail since the middle of last year, but
his Conservative party opponent, Mr Andres Pastrana, launched himself into
the race only last month. Although some opinion polls give Mr Pastrana a
clear advantage, others put Mr Samper slightly ahead.
A Liberal presidential victory is less likely to guarantee continuity in
economic policy than a Conservative one. While both candidates stress social
spending to offset the effects of opening up the economy, Mr Pastrana leans
further towards wanting to attract foreign capital, privatisation and
joining the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr Samper is staking a lot on an ambitious employment programme linked to
economic growth rates of more than 5 per cent a year. Arguing that poverty
and violence go with unemployment, he hopes to create 1.5m jobs over the
four-year term through sectoral plans for agriculture, the modernisation of
industry, exports and small businesses.
Although they both say they would like to be remembered for bringing peace
to Colombia, neither Mr Samper nor Mr Pastrana has come up with a considered
strategy for reducing violence. Both agree that dialogue is still an option
and the government is currently talking on three fronts  - with splinter
groups from the main guerrilla armies, with drug traffickers and with urban
militia organisations.
However, the attempt to bring the guerrillas into the democratic system will
be hampered by the experience of former Maoist guerrillas who chose the
democratic path and founded the Hope, Peace and Freedom party: 140 of them
have been killed.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Protests hit S African black 'homeland'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Riot police fired live ammunition on demonstrators in the nominally
independent black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana yesterday as strikes and
anti-government protests swept the capital, increasing political pressure on
President Lucas Mangope.
In the capital, Mmbatho, and its twin town of Mafikeng, security forces for
a second day fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators.
Earlier in the day riot police stormed the broadcasting centre after the
Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation's chairman - Mr Eddie Mangope, son
of the president - was locked in the building by striking workers.
The occupation of broadcasting centre and demonstrations were part of a
growing series of protests against Mr Mangope, who is resisting South
Africa's transition to black majority rule and has refused to register for
next month's all-race elections.
The protests began with a civil servants' strike, sparked by demands that
their pensions be paid out before the April elections, after which
Bophuthatswana will cease to exist as it will be reincorporated into South
Africa. Civil servants feared the homeland would use their pension fund to
pay government expenses if financial transfers from Pretoria - which account
for about one-third of Bophuthatswana's budget - were cut to put pressure on
Mr Mangope to take part in elections.
The Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body which oversees
South Africa's transition to democracy, believes it has the power to cut off
funds to Bophuthatswana, though this has not yet been tested.
Since then the strike has widened into generalised demonstrations against Mr
Mangope, encouraged by the African National Congress which wants him to
accept the elections, having failed to negotiate the regional powers which
Bophuthatswana and other right-wing groups wanted in exchange for poll
participation.
Mr Mangope has so far refused to allow campaigning in the homeland. ANC
President Nelson Mandela said it was only a matter of time before action was
taken against him. The ANC has urged President FW de Klerk's government to
halt all financial aid and supplies to Bophuthatswana to force it to
participate in the elections.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Prosecutors raid Japanese MP's office: Nakamura ready for
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese prosecutors moved against a national politician yesterday for the
first time in their year-long investigation into widespread corruption
involving the construction industry and the political establishment, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office raided the offices of Mr Kishiro
Nakamura, former construction minister, whom they allege may have taken cash
in exchange for quashing an anti-trust investigation into bid rigging among
big builders.
Prosecutors set in motion a rarely-invoked constitutional procedure for
stripping a lawmaker of his immunity from arrest. It would be the first time
in 27 years that a Japanese lawmaker was subject to such humiliation.
But Mr Nakamura, from the conservative opposition Liberal Democratic party
(LDP), said he was willing to be arrested and fight the charges. Earlier he
had rejected repeated requests to show up at the prosecutor's office for
voluntary questioning.
But yesterday he issued a statement through his lawyers, saying he was ready
for a court battle. 'I dared to opt for being arrested. I am determined to
reveal the truth of the matter in court,' he said.
'As for my arrest, I want the prosecutors to designate the time and date. I
strongly hope to be arrested at the main entrance of the Diet (parliament)
building.'
Since the inquiry started in March last year, more than 30 executives of
Japan's six biggest building companies have been arrested along with four
local government leaders.
So far, no national politician has been arrested. Lawmakers cannot be
arrested while parliament is in session. Normally anyone who comes under
scandal allegations submits to voluntary questioning to avoid public
exposure.
Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki described Mr Nakamura's case as 'historic'
and voiced his full support for the prosecutors. 'This is a historic
scandal. I believe it will turn the history of Japanese politics,' Mr
Mikazuki said. The LDP ruled Japan for 38 years but lost its majority in
general elections last year, ceding power to a coalition headed by Premier
Morihiro Hosokawa.
'This is a very serious matter for our party,' the LDP parliamentary
business manager Mr Sadatoshi Ozato said.
The LDP has launched a campaign against Mr Hosokawa, attacking him for
bungling the economy, botching a US-Japan trade summit meeting and failing
to settle divisions within his coalition. Mr Nakamura's status in the
once-dominant party might explain why prosecutors singled him out first
among 12 national politicians said to be on their list.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Nigeria currency allocation cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's acute foreign exchange shortage forced the country's central bank
yesterday to cut its weekly allocation of hard currency, prompting fears
that the government's foreign exchange policy will lead to declining
production, profitability and investment.
The Central Bank of Nigeria's second allocation this year of foreign
exchange to industry fell from Dollars 200m (Pounds 111m) a fortnight ago to
Dollars 100m.
Foreign exchange has been in short supply since December 1992; some
manufacturers say stocks of raw materials and spare parts have been
declining and replacement or new plant is overdue. The 10-week gap between
the last allocation in 1993 and the first in 1994 worsened the problem.
Bankers say the expected average of Dollars 50m a week will remain well
below demand.
Bulk orders of spare parts or raw materials can be scaled down in
proportion, but this is little use when importing costly capital goods.
Importers can no longer make up the difference with export proceeds sold at
market rates. Prospective foreign investors have been deterred by the new
policy, which has ruled out agreement with official external creditors.
'This is a very serious situation,' a leading manufacturer warned yesterday.
'We have had a disruption of almost three months, then a new system which is
not working well enough. No reasonable stock cover can cope with continuing
under-supply of foreign exchange. Businesses are already thinking of scaling
down production by April.'
In the first budget presented by Gen Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military leader,
the government in January set out to ensure an adequate supply of currency
to industry and control inflation.
Like last year's currency auctions, the allocation is pro rata according to
demand, which encourages inflated applications. The 1994 budget pegged the
exchange rate at N22 to the dollar, more than double the value of the black
market naira, banned the open foreign exchange market and cut interest rates
to 21 per cent, less than a quarter of the estimated inflation rate.
Some manufacturers say the CBN is making the best of a difficult situation.
It has fought off pressure for ministers or civil servants allocating all
forex direct to each end-user. This would have taken Nigeria back to the
days of export licensing in the 1980s.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Bank puts up cost of long-term corporate borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of long-term funds for Japan's hard-pressed corporate borrowers is
to rise, despite the central bank's policy of keeping official interest
rates at a record low.
The Industrial Bank of Japan, the leading long-term credit bank, yesterday
announced it will raise its long-term lending rate to its most credit-worthy
corporate clients by 0.6 percentage points to 4.4 per cent from tomorrow,
the second increase in two months.
Other commercial banks are expected to follow suit and raise interest rates
on long-term loans next month. IBJ's long-term prime rate is regarded as a
benchmark for the industry. Its 0.3 percentage point rise to 3.8 per cent in
February ended an eight-month decline in long-term rates, arousing concern
at the Bank of Japan. The central bank is under increasing pressure to cut
its 1.75 per cent official discount rate to stimulate flagging demand.
Yesterday's move will intensify fears that the Japanese economy's capacity
to recover might become hampered by a lending squeeze. Even before the
latest rise, companies told an IBJ survey that they planned to cut capital
investment this year for the third year running, the longest decline since
the second world war.
IBJ's decision reflects a recent rise in the long-term bond yields, due to a
fall in prices caused by an oversupply in the Japanese government bond
market and the rise in US interest rates. Japan's bond market has faced a
huge sell off recently, as investors locked in profits ahead of the March
book closing.
The turmoil on global bond markets and fears of an increase in bond supply
to finance the economic package and tax cuts announced last month, has
exacerbated the fall.
The Bank of Japan has become increasingly worried that the rise in corporate
lending rates will hurt corporate earnings, hampering economic recovery.
To ease the downturn in the government bond market, it has led short-term
money market rates lower over the past few weeks and the yield spread
between the discount rate and the overnight call rate is currently at a
historical low.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Christopher attacks China over human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China and the US yesterday toughened their war of words on China's human
rights record, souring the atmosphere for this week's visit to Beijing by Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
Mr Christopher, using his harshest language so far about China, expressed
'strong distaste' over Beijing's recent harassment of dissidents and said
the security sweep would have a 'negative effect' on his visit and on the US
review of China's favourable trade status.
China lashed back at criticism from President Bill Clinton and earlier
remarks by Mr Christopher about the arrests of three dissidents and the
overnight interrogations of at least 12 more, calling the US complaints
'irresponsible'. Beijing police, only hours later, showed they were not
deterred by US criticism by taking away Mr Wang Dan, a student leader of the
1989 Tiananmen protests, for questioning. He was later released.
Asked to comment on Mr Clinton's criticism of the recent detention of
leading dissidents, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said: 'No foreign
country, organisation or individual has the right to make irresponsible
remarks or interfere'.
Mr Clinton said last week after China's leading dissident, Mr Wei Jingsheng,
was detained that 'we strongly disapprove of what was done and it is
obviously not helpful to our relations'. Mr Christopher, who is visiting
Australia, has said that human rights issues will top the agenda of his
talks in Beijing with China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
China last week provoked an international outcry when it began rounding up
dissidents including Mr Wei who served more than 14 years in jail for his
role in the 'democracy wall' protests of the late 1970s.
Mr Christopher's visit to China comes at a delicate moment in Sino-US
relations; a decision is pending on renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation
(MFN) status in the US market. Mr Clinton has demanded 'progress' on human
rights before agreeing to renew MFN. A decision is due by June on the lower
tariff regime for an estimated 96 per cent of Chinese products entering the
US.
China has repeatedly denounced attempts to link trade and human rights, and
this is certain to be Beijing's prevailing message this weekend. 'Human
rights and MFN are completely separate issues. We strongly oppose linking
them,' Mr Qian said recently.
The authorities seem to fear that dissidents will use the National People's
Congress or Mr Christopher's visit to bring their cause to international
notice by circulating petitions calling for increased political freedom.
The Public Security Bureau, in a rare public statement, denied it was
intimidating dissidents. It said Mr Wei and Mr Wang Dan were not in
detention. Only Mr Zhou Guogiang (a labour leader and lawyer), Mr Yuan
Hongbing (a lawyer), and Mr Wang Jiaqi had been detained and were 'being
investigated'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Steel manufacturers suffer an identity crisis: An industry
embarrassed at having to omit dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Japan's steel companies, which pride themselves on being the pillar of
the country's industrial might, being forced to pass their dividend is an
embarrassment they have not had to suffer since just after the Second World
War.
'We must grit our teeth and do our best,' Mr Matao Kojima, executive vice
president of Sumitomo Metal Industries said yesterday after an announcement
by the five big steelmakers that they all expected to incur losses in the
year to the end of this month.
The steel industry has found itself in these dire circumstances just four
years after production levels reached a peak of 110m tonnes. At the time,
the strength of demand from Japan's surging domestic economy was enough to
halt fundamental restructuring programmes the industry had embarked on to
cut overcapacity and prepare for leaner years ahead.
With those reforms left incomplete, the industry has suffered a crippling
slump in demand from its big customers in the domestic motor vehicle,
electronics and construction industries as Japan's economy has continued its
relentless slowdown.
The weakness of consumer demand and the yen's sharp rise took their toll on
the motor and electronics industries which in turn depressed demand for the
steelmakers' products. Meanwhile, in the construction sector, private
activity, with the general exception of private housing, has been slack.
On the export front, Japanese steel makers have faced pressure in the US as
a result of anti-dumping action by the American industry. Even before the US
authorities made any official decision, fears of anti-dumping action had led
to uncertainty about supplies. Baring Securities estimates exports to the US
over the year will be down about 25 per cent.
Even a relatively bright spot - the surge in exports to China - will not
have the uplifting impact on earnings that might have been hoped for. While
exports to China will be up about 100 per cent from a year ago, when
Japanese exports to that country had reached a record high, these have been
low value-added products which served not so much to raise profits as to
keep the facilities of Japanese mills on stream.
Perhaps the most telling illustration of the severity of the steel makers
business slump is the securities sales they are being forced to make to
minimise their losses. The companies are having to turn their backs on their
traditional ties, cemented by equity holdings, with financial institutions
and business customers and to sell at a time when share prices are low.
Nippon Steel will sell about Y66bn (Pounds 420m) worth of securities
holdings and Kobe Steel some Y31bn.
To cope, the companies are reviewing ambitious diversification moves - into
areas ranging from semiconductor production to liquor importing and flying
instruction. Nippon Steel has pulled out of loss-making notebook computer
sales while Kawasaki Steel is in negotiations to sell its silicon wafer
production venture. More changes in non-core business plans are expected to
follow.
Costs are being attacked widely through significant cuts in jobs, capital
expenditure and distribution. Kobe Steel intends to cut its labour force by
about 3,800 while Kawasaki Steel will reduce 30 per cent of its managers.
While in large part, job reductions will be achieved through natural
attrition and transfers to subsidiaries 'there are no sacred territories in
our bid to reduce costs', Sumitomo's Mr Kojima said yesterday.
Japan's steel companies have yet to address the structural problem of
overcapacity which is at the root of their difficulties and is likely to
maintain pressure on profits. While the Japanese steel industry has capacity
of about 110m tonnes, even the steel companies themselves admit that demand
for their products is likely to range between 90m and 95m tonnes.
'It's always the most terrifying, the most expensive thing that is left to
the very end,' says Mr Stephen Wolfe, steel analyst at Baring Securities.
The Japanese steel companies have concentrated their efforts on cutting
people, or raising production efficiencies, but that does not address the
fundamental problem of collapsing prices, Mr Wolfe notes. For that, it is
necessary to reduce capacity 'and to make sure people are scrambling for
steel.'
While any moves to cut capacity were virtually ruled out by Nippon Steel,
which, as industry leader, has historically set a model for the others, Mr
Wolfe is not counting out the possibility that the four other companies may
be considering such a move. Their decision to pass their dividend in spite
of Nippon Steel's determination to pay one may be an indication that the
mighty Nippon Steel is losing its leadership, he believes.
If that is the case, and Japanese steel makers are preparing to map out a
more independent course, each for their own survival, the industry could
emerge from its present predicament in much better shape.
While they face growing competition from South Korean and other low cost
producers at the lower end of the market, their ability to produce high
quality products, such as cold-rolled steel sheet used in the car industry,
remains unchallenged.
'The future of steel as a product is not over,' says Mr Kojima. 'In terms of
technology Japan outdoes the rest. As long as we are competitive we can
survive.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Israelis in court over share scandal

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three Israeli bank officials appeared in a Tel Aviv magistrates' court
yesterday in connection with a share and bond price manipulation scandal on
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
They are the latest in a line of brokers and fund managers to be
interrogated since a big investigation of alleged insider trading and share
manipulation was revealed last month by the Israel Securities Authority.
Many more are said to be under investigation.
The unfolding of what is potentially the biggest share manipulation scandal
since the 1983 bank shares collapse has sent jitters across the stock
market, which has plummeted this year.
The worst affected stocks have been the smaller capitalised companies quoted
on the Karam index, which are more easily subject to manipulation. Since the
middle of January the Karam index - which had a powerful bull run last year
 -has plunged about 27 per cent while the Mishtanim two sided index of the
100 heavily capitalised companies has fallen about 12.5 per cent.
Mr David Rosenberg, a market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments,
said yesterday that in the short-term the investigation was having a marked
downward effect on the market.
However, he said the investigation would have a long-term benefit because
'it improves the credibility of the market. The key thing in any securities
market is that traders feel they are operating on a level playing field.
Enforcement by the Securities Authority will be especially good for foreign
investors.'
Israeli police said yesterday they had arrested four out of five leaders of
anti-Arab groups wanted in a government crackdown on Jewish militants since
the Hebron massacre, Reuter adds from Jerusalem.

The Angolan government yesterday presented a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 944m)
budget heavy on defence spending but seen as a step towards economic reform,
Reuter reports from Luanda.
The 1994 economic plan presented to parliament by the Luanda government,
fighting renewed civil war with Unita rebels, sets an annual inflation
target of 260 per cent by December, down from the 1,840 per cent registered
this previous December 1993. The plan envisages 2.5 per cent GDP growth in
1994.

An official European observer team yesterday condemned Monday's
parliamentary elections in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan, saying the system of
preventing abuses was flawed and government-sponsored candidates enjoyed a
built-in advantage, Steve LeVine reports from Alma Ata.
The team, representing the Council for Security and Co-operation in Europe,
stopped short of calling the elections rigged. But it said election
procedures allowed such abuses as ballot-box stuffing, and that the
pre-election campaign handicapped independent candidates.
The election was to fill a new 177-member parliament that will replace a
larger legislative body dissolved in December.

King Hussein of Jordan led a delegation to Saudi Arabia yesterday, on his
first visit to the kingdom since relations deteriorated because of the
1990-1991 Gulf crisis, James Whittington writes from Amman.
Jordan's media reported the king had left for Saudi Arabia to perform the
Ummra, a minor Moslem pilgrimage. But officials acknowledged he was seeking
a meeting with King Fahd. One western diplomat in Amman described the trip
as 'significant'.
It demonstrated Jordan's desire to achieve a rapprochement with the Saudis,
still bitter over King Hussein's refusal to back the US-led effort to force
Iraq out of Kuwait in early 1991.

the Polish foreign minister, said it was not realistic for Poland to become
a full EU member in the near future, because of the costs of extending the

The Dutch government has dropped controversial plans to tax the profits of
companies operating mobile phone networks. It is instead considering
charging mobile phone operators for the use of radio frequencies.
Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned telecoms operator, plans to
launch a European GSM standard mobile communications network in July, and a
second operator will be chosen by tender in late 1994. Mrs Hanja
Maij-Weggen, public works minister, said consortia bidding for licences
would be informed that Dutch policies on radio frequencies were under review
and subject to change. However, legislation on the use of frequencies is not
expected in time for the opening of bidding in the autumn, because of
general elections on May 3. Several international consortia, grouped around
the three main Dutch banks, ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank, are expected to
compete for the second operator's licence.

<TEXT>
Europe's information technology industry suffered its worst year in 1993,
and has only limited prospects for growth next year, according to a report
from the European Information Technology Observatory, the commission's
co-ordinating group for IT. Growth in the European IT market was 2 per cent
in 1993, down from annual growth of 15 per cent five years ago. EITO said
faster deregulation and a harmonisation of standards were essential to allow
European groups to compete on equal terms with US companies. The US market
grew by 7 per cent last year and now accounts for 37 per cent of the world
market. Japan accounts for 16 per cent, compared with the EU's 29 per cent.
However, with new markets opening up in eastern Europe and in technological
fields straddling telecommunications and IT, EITO predicted that the
Ecu262bn (Pounds 198bn) European IT market could grow by around 3.6 per cent
in 1994.

The Hungarian parliament yesterday voted to force secret police agents and
informers to retire from public life, with the threat of exposure if they do
not. The move is part of a 'justice' campaign by the right-wing government,
designed to focus attention on the Socialists' past wrongdoings, ahead of
elections on May 8. Mr Gyula Horn (left) the Socialist leader, has a
commanding personal lead over Prime Minister Peter Boross in the opinion
polls. However, Mr Horn served in the workers' militia that helped Soviet
troops put down the 1956 uprising against communist rule. The new
legislation targets members of this organisation as well as the secret
police. The government has also begun arresting people accused of war crimes
during the uprising and is to vet newspaper editors, believing the media to
be 'dominated' by former communists.

The International Labour Organisation is set to abandon its long-standing
opposition to private employment agencies following publication of a report
recommending reform of ILO Convention 96. After pressure from the European
Commission, several European countries, in particular Germany and Spain, are
abandoning their tight controls on private agencies. However Italy and
Greece continue to ban them completely. It may be several years before the
ILO formally abandons Convention 96 - which, in 1949, recommended abolition
of fee-charging employment agencies. But the report, written by Mr Sergio
Ricca, and endorsed by the ILO secretariat, is a significant step towards
phasing out the convention. Traditionally, opposition to private agencies is
based on hostility to the idea of private companies making money out of
unemployment and on the fear that state agencies will be left with
hard-to-place workers.

The two parties in France's ruling coalition, the Gaullist RPR and the
centre-right UDF, yesterday negotiated a common policy platform for this
June's European elections, ending the threat of rival electoral lists, which
would have split the government of Mr Edouard Balladur. The coalition, which
is expected to be approved by the parties' leaders later today, is likely to
win up to 40 per cent of the vote, according to opinion polls, making it by
far the largest force. The opposition Socialists are expected to take less
than 20 per cent in a divided left-wing field. But the coalition has yet to
decide who should head their common list, or whether their Euro-MPs will sit
in the same political grouping at Strasbourg. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing's
UDF has been trying to persuade the RPR to join it in the Christian Democrat
grouping known as the European People's Party. Until now, the Gaullists have
sat together with Ireland's conservative Fianna Fail party in a separate
group, while deputies from the UDF have been split between the Liberal and
EPP groups.

FT  09 MAR 94 / From rich city to Germany's poor-house: David Waller visits
Schweinfurt, symbol of a loss of manufacturing industry's competitive edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within two years the city of Schweinfurt in northern Bavaria has gone from
being one of western Germany's most prosperous cities to one of its poorest.
From having a surplus of jobs, it now has 17 per cent unemployment, the
highest in Bavaria and far above the 8.8 per cent for western Germany as a
whole.
'Germany's poor-house' and 'city of Angst' are just two of the labels which
have stuck to the small city of 53,000 inhabitants since its troubles
attracted the attention of the national media. Schweinfurt, close to the
border with the former East Germany, has become a symbol of what can happen
when western Germany's manufacturing industry loses its competitive edge.
'The crisis in this city is worse than elsewhere in Germany,' comments Mr
Erwin Saal, head of the works' council at FAG Kugelfischer, the big
ball-bearings manufacturer which has been the mainstay of employment in the
city for more than a century. 'But at the same time it is symptomatic of the
hangover German industry has brought upon itself after more than 10 years of
unbroken growth.
'In that time wages rose rapidly and the working week became the shortest in
the world. As a result we have structural problems overlayed with deep
recession - and nowhere in Germany is that more obvious than in
Schweinfurt.'
The city's past prosperity, and its current problems, are a result of the
local economy's dependence on three big employers: Kugelfischer and SKF, two
ball-bearings giants, and Fichtel  Sachs, the manufacturer of clutches,
shock-absorbers and other vehicle components and which is part of the
Mannesmann engineering conglomerate.
In the years since the Second World War the three acted as a magnet for
employment throughout the Franconia region of northern Bavaria. The city's
tax revenues, drawn from the big three's profits, were the largest in the
prosperous state of Bavaria after Munich and Ingolstadt.
But more recently the big three have suffered - in especially acute form -
the combination of high wage costs and the intensified competition from
foreign manufacturers that has hit German industry so hard.
While the city's tax revenues have vanished, the companies' response to
plunging order-books has been a wave of job-cuts on a scale never before
seen in Schweinfurt. In the past two years about 7,000 people have lost
their jobs.
The lay-offs at Kugelfischer have been especially traumatic. Since it came
to the brink of collapse in January last year, the family-controlled company
has reduced its total employees from 31,000 to 15,700 and sold off 13
subsidiaries. In Schweinfurt the group cut its workforce by 43 per cent,
from 8,172 at the end of 1992 to 4,671 at the beginning of February this
year.
'Nowhere in Germany has a company gone through so radical a restructuring,'
says chief executive Mr Peter-Jurgen Kreher. (The plans for the
rationalisation were drawn up by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, more recently called in
to sort out Metallgesellschaft, the deeply troubled Frankfurt conglomerate.)
Kugelfischer's role as a provider of life-time employment from one
generation of Schweinfurters to the next was smashed overnight.
'If someone had said two years ago that Kugelfischer would suffer this kind
of fate, you would have been laughed out of court,' reflects Mr Ernst Lang,
head of the work's council at the Swedish-owned SKF, where the workforce has
shrunk by nearly a quarter to 4,460 in the past two years. 'I still don't
think people here in Schweinfurt realise how serious it is. They are hopeful
that something will turn up.'
Many of those laid off were sent into early retirement and even those who
were made redundant received generous pay-offs - in some cases as much as
DM150,000 (Pounds 58,365). Mr Lang believes that many in Schweinfurt are
suffering from an illusion of prosperity and that the real problems - and
real poverty - will emerge in a few years when the pay-outs have been
exhausted.
'The rude awakening has yet to come,' agrees Mrs Gudrun Grieser, a former
English teacher who has been the city's mayor since 1992. 'I have no
illusions: the jobs we have lost by the thousand will only be replaced by
the dozen.'
She warns about painting the picture too black, praising the skills of the
city's well-trained workers and explaining how she has persuaded Bavaria's
state government to commit DM100m to promote small business in the
Schweinfurt region. 'But the money can't be used - there just aren't enough
worthwhile projects to invest in,' she says.
The problem for Schweinfurt is that the incentives it can offer to draw new
businesses into the region are nowhere near as generous as those on offer in
the former East Germany, just 30 miles away. 'After reunification the Ossis
(east Germans) used to drive over here in their Trabants looking for jobs,'
muses Mr Fritz Glombowski, deputy head of SKF's works' council. 'Soon it'll
be the other way round and we'll be commuting to Thuringia.'

<TEXT>
Germany's economy will grow by 1.5 per cent in 1994, according to a report
published today by one of Germany's five key economic institutes. It said
strong demand for exports and further investment would help lift the economy
out of its worst post-war recession, even though domestic orders might
continue to slide. Low wage deals should improve the prospects for economic
growth, with lower interest rates helping to counteract their effect on
consumer demand. Unemployment was likely to remain constant in 1994 and
1995, falling only in 1996, but a significant fall in the numbers on
short-time working was expected before then, the report said. Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, economics minister, said in January that the economy would grow by
between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent this year, but DIW, another think-tank, said
the economy would shrink by 0.5 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Economic Watch: German unemployment rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German unemployment rose slightly in February to a new post-war record of
4.04m, from the previous record of 4.03m in January. The pan-German
unemployment rate was 10.5 per cent of the workforce. In western Germany the
rate rose to 8.9 per cent in February, from 8.8 per cent in January, while
the eastern German rate rose to 17.1 per cent, from 17.0 per cent in
January. The increase in western Germany was below analysts' expectations
and represented a slowing in the rate of increase. Unusually poor weather in
the second half of February may also have contributed to the rise. However,
revised figures for Germany's fourth-quarter gross domestic product showed a
fall of 0.5 per cent from the previous quarter and a drop of 0.9 per cent
from a year earlier.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the European Union was 10.9 per
cent in January, up from a revised 10.8 per cent in December and 10.0 per
cent in January 1993. Among the under-25s, EU unemployment reached 21.1 per
cent in January, up from 19.3 per cent in January 1993.
Italy's private Isco economic research body forecast Italian GDP growth of
between 1.2 and 1.3 per cent in 1994. The government target is 1.6 per cent,
but Italy's chief accountant said the Isco forecast was realistic.
Swiss car imports rose by 16.3 per cent in February 1994 to 21,521 cars,
from 18,512 in February 1993. Total car imports for the first two months of
1994 came to 42,179, up 9.5 per cent from 38,531 in the same period of 1993.

<TEXT>
The US, anxious to run ahead of pressure from its Nato allies to send ground
troops to Bosnia, is speeding up its search for a political settlement for
the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Charles Redman, its special envoy, yesterday met President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia in an effort to draw the Bosnian Serbs into last week's
federation agreement between Bosnian Croats and Moslems. He later met
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in Zagreb.
Tomorrow, Mr Cyrus Vance, the former United Nations peace mediator, will
meet Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister, in Geneva to try to
resolve Greece's dispute with neighbouring Macedonia.
Mr Redman's talks in Belgrade reflect Washington's belief that participation
of the Bosnian Serbs is crucial for securing stability in Bosnia and for
putting together a broader agreement.
'We need to engage the Bosnian Serbs in order to put something together that
would represent an overall settlement,' said Mr Redman. UN and US diplomats
yesterday said the issue for the Bosnian Serbs was the status they would
have if they accepted the federal plan. The accord envisages a federation of
Bosnian Croats and Moslems linked with Croatia through a confederal
structure.
UN diplomats have warned Bosnian Serbs that if they reject the Washington
agreement, then 70 per cent of the territory they hold would be 'placed in
limbo'.
'It would not be recognised by the international community and we would not
sanction any union of Serbia with eastern Bosnia,' a senior UN negotiator
said.
In an effort to bring the Serbs to the negotiating table, diplomats stressed
that the Bosnian Croat/Moslem federation was aimed neither at isolating the
Serbs, nor at providing an instrument to launch a spring offensive against
Serbs in eastern Bosnia.
Any concessions by the Bosnian Serbs and Croatia would involve:
The Bosnian Serbs ceding territory in eastern Bosnia, and agreeing to lift
the sieges of the Moslem-held enclaves of Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica.
Mr Milosevic and Mr Tudjman agreeing on the status of Serb-held territories
in Croatia. Croatia agreeing to grant extensive autonomy to Serbs in
south-western and eastern Croatia in return for Zagreb regaining control
over the republic. But it is far from certain if Mr Milosevic could, or
wants to persuade the Serb leadership in Croatia to accept this proposal
since the war has radicalised them.
A Spanish aircraft enforcing the Bosnian no-fly zone was hit by ground fire
over Croatia yesterday and four passengers were slightly injured, Reuter
reports from Naples. The CASA-212 logistics aircraft had to make an
emergency landing at Rijeka airport on Croatia's Adriatic coast.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Ruhe rejects more cuts in defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, yesterday warned against
further cuts in defence spending following a report by the parliamentary
ombudsman saying soldiers were demoralised and bewildered by equipment
shortages and confusion about the role of the German army.
Mr Alfred Biehle, the ombudsman who visited troops throughout Germany, said
there was a 'discrepancy' between objectives set out for the armed forces
and means available to meet them.
Soldiers on exercise were now shouting 'bang, bang' to simulate the sound of
rifle fire because bullets were too costly, the report said. Far-reaching
cuts in defence spending have aggravated problems arising from the fusion of
the West German Bundeswehr and the former East German Volksarmee.
'The fact that budget commitments and structural decisions have been
cancelled or changed in quick succession has shattered the credibility and
leadership ability of the political and military commanders,' Mr Biehle
wrote in his annual report.
'Soldiers expect, with right, that politicians clearly tell the German
population why it needs a Bundeswehr in the future and what sort of an
extended objective it will have.'
Falling morale in the armed forces has meant more people were refusing
national service and the number of conscientious objectors in 1993 shot up
to 111,190, up from 60,269 three years earlier.
The Bundeswehr Association, to which more than 250,000 soldiers belong,
welcomed Mr Biehle's report, saying it highlighted longstanding 'anxieties
and problems in the armed forces'.
The growing number of professional soldiers who had been retired to meet
savings targets meant the Bundeswehr had almost reached its reduced target
of 370,000 men.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Balladur declares war on Franglais: A new law will lead the
Gallic offensive against English and its bastard child
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday declared himself ready to do
battle on behalf of French. Inaugurating a new term of office for the
'Higher Council of the French Language', he told its 29 members that
safeguarding French was 'a political priority' of his government.
It is now quite clear that under Mr Balladur, a man whose love of
subjunctives (used in expressions of hope or fear) perfectly expresses his
nuance style of government, France will soon have a new language law, along
the lines of the draft already prepared by Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture
minister.
Behind the government's Gallic counter-offensive, of course, lie both hope
and fear. Its hope is to capitalise on its recent Gatt success in protecting
France's system of subsidising and protecting its film industry, in a way
that will prove politically popular in next year's presidential election. Mr
Toubon happens to be the keenest supporter of Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr
Balladur's rival for the Elysee.
The government's fear is that if it does not act soon to stem the rising
tide of English or its bastard child, Franglais, it will be too late. The
storm clouds are gathering from the north, with the imminent arrival of
English-prone Scandinavians into the European Union threatening to tilt the
linguistic balance in Brussels decisively in favour of Shakespeare's tongue
and against that of Racine.
Mr Toubon's aides are quick to point out that their new bill is not like
Quebec's controversial language law which banned the public use of any other
language but French. Rather, they say, it is designed to ensure that French
citizens, employees, and consumers get their information in French, though
it may be accompanied by a foreign translation.
The bill is aimed at beefing up the provisions of a 1975 language law, which
has been widely flouted, say Mr Toubon's aides, partly because the penalties
of FFr300 (Pounds 34) to FFr600 for breaking it are now only the equivalent
of a Paris parking fine. Since 1975, some 100-200 individuals and companies
a year have been fined, mainly for labelling products or advertising jobs in
a language other than French. In addition to sharply raising the level of
fines, the new bill would enable associations de defence de la langue
francaise to take those who infringe the law directly to court.
Mr Toubon's ministry has two particular targets in its sights. One is what
it believes, apparently from employees' letters of complaints, is the
growing tendency of French companies to issue instructions to their French
staff in France in other languages. An unscientific check with some of
France's biggest companies, such as the Alcatel group which does less than
30 per cent of its business inside France, is that some respond in English,
either to boost their international image or to make their frequent foreign
clients feel more at home.
But issuing internal instructions in English to French staff - says Air
Liquide, the industrial gas group, which is suspected by Mr Toubon's
ministry of doing just that - would be mad 'because it makes good sense to
communicate in a language that is understood'.
The second and more substantive target of the Toubon bill is conferences,
which would henceforth have to provide translation into French. This may
pose problems for the French scientific community which increasingly works
in English, the international lingua franca of exact science.
France's Academy of Science came out formally in January against any attempt
to legislate in this field.
But Mr Michel Crozon, a physicist who also serves as director of
communications for the CNRS, the body which funnels state money into French
science, says real damage to French scientists' ability to communicate with
their brethren abroad would only occur if the former were forced to publish
in French.
Paris's famous medical research body, the Institut Pasteur, caused a
domestic rumpus in 1989 by switching the titles of its publications into
English, in recognition of the fact that less than 10 per cent of the
manuscripts it was receiving from abroad were in French.
But it now also publishes a purely French journal as well as 'encouraging'
Anglophone authors to provide French precis of their articles - as indeed
does the Academy of Scienceas a matter of course in its publications.
Imposing French, of course, begs the question of what is French. That is a
matter for the Academie Francaise, set up in 1635 to guard the language,
and, more recently for 'terminology committees' set up by each ministry.
Both are having a struggle to keep up with the advance of other languages,
chiefly English.
The Academie Francaise has reached the letter 'F' in revising its
dictionary, while the ministerial committees invent 200-300 new approved
Gallicisms each year.
But the new terms have an equal struggle entering popular usage; certainly
the sports ministry's prescription of a 'corner' kick in football as a coup
de pied du coin has not.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and the International Monetary Fund resume crucial loan negotiations
in Moscow today with both their reputations on the line, Reuter reports from
Washington. Moscow wants IMF endorsement of its credentials as a pro-reform
government, while the Fund is seeking to justify its position as lead
manager in helping Russia remake its economy in the capitalist mould.
Reaching agreement will not be easy. International monetary sources rate the
chances of the two sides striking a deal on an economic reform programme
that the IMF could back with a Dollars 1.5bn loan as no better than 50-50.
Moscow's commitment to reform has been questioned following the departure of
key reformers from the government in January, and the IMF has found itself
criticised by the US and others for not doing enough to encourage Russian
reforms. The IMF has already lent Russia Dollars 2.5bn, but has held back
further credits because of doubts about Moscow's willingness to press ahead
with economic reforms.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Focus on Charles Redman, US special envoy to Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Redman, 50, the US special envoy to the region appointed last
August, and now the pivotal player in the peace process, spends his time
commuting between Zagreb, Sarajevo, Serbia and Vienna, where Bosnian Croats
and Moslems and Croatian officials are trying to put flesh on a preliminary
federal plan for Bosnia, writes Judy Dempsey.
'When he first sat in on the Geneva talks, I think he was overwhelmed by the
complexity of the issues,' a senior UN official said. 'He listened. He
learned. Washington could get its fingers burnt just like the Europeans.' Mr
Redman is trying to avoid this by making sure no lines are crossed. He is on
the phone constantly to Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's envoy to the former
Yugoslavia, the German Foreign Ministry, and the UN.
'Redman wants to capitalise on the momentum for peace. If it comes, he'll
have a hard time convincing Congress to send ground troops to keep that
peace,' a US diplomat said.
Sceptics believe Mr Redman, former ambassador to Sweden and state department
spokesman, does not have enough political clout, but he leans on his
contacts at the intelligence department of the US air force and at Nato,
where he served in the 1970s and 1980s respectively.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Euro Disney edges closer to Pounds 1.3bn rescue deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the leisure group, and Walt Disney, its US parent company, are
understood to have mapped out the basic framework for a FFr12bn (Pounds
1.37bn) restructuring plan with Euro Disney's banks. They are optimistic
that an outline rescue can be agreed before the March 31 deadline.
The main components of the deal are expected to be a FFr6bn rights issue and
a FFr4bn reduction in Euro Disney's financial costs through a combination of
the banks' reducing their interest charges on its debt and Disney's waiving
entitlement to fees and royalties. The remaining FFr2bn would come from a
series of smaller measures such as asset transfers.
Euro Disney is owned 49 per cent by Disney of the US. The remaining 51 per
cent is publicly quoted.
'There's still some way to go and all the details have yet to be ironed
out', said a senior banker involved with the negotiations.
Once a preliminary deal has been agreed, it will take at least three months
to be completed. Disney is committed to bankrolling Euro Disney until March
31 but is understood to be willing to extend its support beyond that
deadline if the banks have agreed in principle to a deal.
A team of senior Disney executives, advised by Lazard Freres in New York,
has moved to Paris and will stay until the deal has been agreed. It is
holding regular negotiating sessions with the banks' steering committee, led
by Banque Indosuez and Banque Nationale de Paris.
Both sides have agreed that a rights issue will form the core of the
restructuring plan. Disney will take up its full entitlement of the issue,
maintaining its stake, and some of the creditor banks may act as
underwriters.
The two camps are still arguing over the precise terms of the proposed
reduction in Euro Disney's financial costs.
At present, Disney is entitled to royalties on 10 per cent of Euro Disney's
admissions and 5 per cent of food and souvenir sales. The banks are pressing
it to waive the royalties or reduce them to a token level. Disney is arguing
that its royalty entitlement should eventually be reintroduced if Euro
Disney meets, or beats, certain targets.
Similarly, the banks are asking Disney to extend indefinitely its waiver of
a management fee worth 3 per cent on Euro Disney's turnover. The US group
again hopes eventually to reinstate the fee.
Once the fee and royalty issue has been settled, Disney will press the banks
for reciprocal cuts in their interest rates on a large part of Euro Disney's
debt.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Ex-envoy contradicts Hurd over aid-arms linkage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's former high commissioner to Malaysia yesterday contradicted claims
made by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that an offer of aid for
Malaysia's Pergau dam had been 'disentangled' from sales of defence
equipment.
Sir Nicholas Spreckley told the House of Commons foreign affairs committee
that a complex mathematical formula linking the aid and defence deals in a
protocol signed in March 1988 had not been discarded by the UK government
when concluding final negotiations over aid for Malaysia.
Instead, he told MPs that the formula - which Malaysian negotiators had
insisted on when drawing up the protocol on defence sales - had determined
the UK's decision to offer about Pounds 200m to Malaysia later that year.
Sir Nicholas's testimony contradicted claims made by Mr Hurd and by Lord
Younger, the former defence secretary - who also gave evidence to the
committee yesterday - that there was no long-term linkage between aid and
defence contracts signed with the Malaysians in 1988.
The committee is investigating Britain's decision to give Malaysia Pounds
234m to help build the Pergau dam, a decision that members of the Overseas
Development Administration have described as 'a very bad buy'. It is also
examining whether ministers broke Whitehall and international guidelines by
linking aid money to defence contracts.
Last week, Mr Hurd told the committee that there had been 'a brief
entanglement' between aid and trade in a protocol signed by Lord Younger, in
March 1988.
But the foreign secretary strongly argued that ministers sought to
'disentangle' the contracts later that year, pursuing them as two distinct
projects. to avoid breaking the guidelines prohibiting linkage.
Sir Nicholas admitted yesterday that, after Lord Younger had returned from
Kuala Lumpur, ministers wanted to remove a clause in the protocol which
offered Malaysia up to 20 per cent of the Pounds 1bn sale of defence
equipment in the form of aid money.
Sir Nicholas said he advised ministers that if that clause were withdrawn,
'something had to be put in its place, something that would bear
comparison'.
He told the committee a promise of up to Pounds 200m for development
projects made in a letter of June 28 1988 to the Malaysian government was a
technical restatement of the formula in the original protocol.
Lord Younger denied that '20 per cent' had been a 'shaping figure' in
negotiations but admitted he alone had agreed to the inclusion of the aid
formula in the arms contract. In contrast to Mr Hurd, he said the protocol
did not link arms and aid, because the document had no 'executive role'. He
also said Lord Howe, then foreign secretary, had agreed that the protocol
did not make a firm commitment of aid.
Lord Younger also said he had held discussions with Foreign Office officials
on the nature of his trip before flying to Kuala Lumpur in March 1988.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Vote dispute threatens EU expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's planned move from 12 to 16 member states faced collapse
last night, as a result of the British and Spanish refusal to countenance
any dilution of their voting rights in an expanded Europe.
Talks at foreign minister level broke up in disarray in Brussels, although
the hard bargaining will resume next Tuesday.
While the EU states were deadlocked on voting rights, they were however
within an ace of agreeing with Norway on its entry terms. Sweden, Finland
and Austria concluded their membership negotiations with the EU last week.
But none of the four newcomers can join by January 1995, as planned, unless
the voting rights issue is cleared - along with other hurdles such as
referendums in the applicant countries.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany which has emerged as the main
champion of the EU enlargement, blamed the UK for the impasse on votes. He
also warned Spain that Germany would block an increase in EU aid for
southern member states after 1995 if Madrid rejected Norway's entry because
Oslo would not allow it to catch more cod in Norwegian waters.
German and Dutch officials warned that prospects for EU enlargement were
slipping away. The European Parliament has to decide by tomorrow whether to
proceed with its approval of terms for newcomers to join. It has said it
will not approve enlargement if the British and Spanish line on votes
triumphs.
Senior EU officials were vitriolic about the UK government. They accused it
of mollifying anti-European factions in the Conservative party even though
it said EU enlargement was at the top of its European agenda. 'They want to
reintroduce the (national) veto by the back door,' one EU ambassador said.
Britain and Spain insist on retaining the existing 23 votes needed to block
EU legislation - currently out of 76 votes distributed among the 12 member
states roughly according to their size. Their partners want to shift the
'blocking minority' to 27 votes, to maintain the same percentage formula in
a Europe of 16 sharing 90 votes.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, proposed a compromise of moving to
27, plus a committee to study vote distribution before the EU's
constitutional review in 1996. The committee would consider British,
Spanish, Italian and German wishes for a closer link between votes and
population size.
A senior British official said: 'I can assure you there will be no
settlement except on British terms.' Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign
minister, said: 'If there is no solution to this problem, we will not
unfortunately be able to celebrate what we all want - enlargement.'
Amid this test of negotiating nerve, the EU and Norway looked close to
resolving the difficulty over Spanish insistence on recovering 'historic
rights' to 7,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod in the face of Oslo's refusal to
concede a single extra fish.
A Commission formula, which both Madrid and Oslo were prepared to consider,
in effect recycles fish quotas Norway conceded when it joined the European
Economic Area free trade zone.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Increase in output strengthens hopes of steady recovery:
Pessimism over base rate cut hits shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the UK economic recovery might be faltering were assuaged
yesterday by news of faster-than-expected growth in manufacturing output and
industrial production in January.
The Central Statistical Office said January's manufacturing output was 1.1
per cent higher than in December, while industrial production, which
includes energy, rose by 0.8 per cent. However, the January increases are
from a lower base as the CSO reduced its estimates of output and
manufacturing production in 1993.
The output statistics depressed sentiment on the London stock market as
traders felt it made an immediate cut in base rates less likely. Shares were
also hit by falls in bond markets in Germany and the UK. The FT-SE 100 index
fell 41.5 points to close at 3,264.4.
Weak economic statistics published last month had cast doubt on the strength
of the UK recovery and revived calls for sharper base rate cuts.
Manufacturing output had been estimated to have fallen by 0.5 per cent in
December, although that has been revised to a 0.2 per cent fall. Many of the
figures appear to have been distorted by the effect of the Christmas period
and the CSO prefers to look at quarterly trends. Manufacturing output was
0.6 per cent higher in the three months to January than in the previous
three. Industrial production was 0.9 per cent higher.
'The figures confirm that the December data were erratic and that people are
still too downbeat about the prospects for economic recovery in the UK,'
said Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, who last week
increased his forecast of this year's UK economic growth from 2.6 to 2.8 per
cent.
The government is forecasting a 2.5 per cent growth in UK gross domestic
product in 1994.
Some observers, however, believe that tax increases taking effect next month
will slow the pace of economic growth. Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming
thinks a combination of higher taxes and a weak labour market will restrict
consumer spending and limit GDP growth to 1.8 per cent this year.
Yesterday's figures prompted the CSO to increase its estimates of the trend
in manufacturing output growth from 1 per cent to 2 per cent annually and
for the trend in production from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent annual growth.
The main source for January's manufacturing output rise was the engineering
sector, notably electrical and optical equipment.
The main reason for the downward revision in estimated 1993 growth in
manufacturing output and industrial production was higher than expected
export prices. The CSO uses the inflation rate to 'deflate' output cash
totals and reach volume estimates.
As a result, manufacturing output was 1.8 per cent higher in 1993 than in
1992, down from the previous 1.9 per cent estimate, whereas 1993 industrial
production was 2.5 per cent up on 1992.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Prices cut in battle for electricity sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 7,000 large consumers of electricity are to buy from a supplier
other than their regional power company for the first time next month,
taking advantage of the opening of their market to competition.
Many more among the 45,000 power users able to shop around for supplies from
April 1 have signed deals with local distributors that will give them
significant price reductions. Eligible users include industrial concerns,
supermarkets, large schools and hospitals.
Some distributors - including Manweb, in the north-west of England and in
north Wales, and Midlands Electricity - say they have offered consumers
outside their regions price cuts of up to 20 per cent.
Most reductions fall within 4 per cent and 10 per cent. Some consumers
enjoying lower tariffs have received no immediate financial benefit.
The reductions stem from the second stage of the liberalisation of the
electricity market, which will allow users of between 100kW and 1MW at their
period of peak consumption to pick from any licensed supplier.
Until April 1 they have had to buy from their regional distributor. Only
consumers of more than 1MW had a choice of supplier. By 1998, all consumers,
including householders, will be able to select their supplier.
To take advantage of the deregulated system from April 1, eligible consumers
should already have signed contracts with a supplier, which should have
registered the arrangement with the electricity pool, through which power is
traded.
Ms Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive, said the organisation knew of
7,300 deals involving a customer and a supplier other than their regional
distributor. 'We expect that figure to grow perhaps by about double,' she
said. Consumers can still sign deals. The pool requires 20 working days'
notice before agreements come into effect.
Most regional power companies say consumers with lower demand, perhaps 100kW
to 300kW, are less interested in shopping around. Some users in that
category complain of difficulty in persuading power companies to make
acceptable offers.
Powerline, the supply subsidiary of Midlands Electricity, says it has
targeted smaller companies and, partly as a result, has won 1,000 sites
outside its area.
MEB, Northern, Eastern Electricity, East Midlands Electricity, and
generators PowerGen and National Power are said to be among the most active
in the market.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Esselte despite
weak markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Esselte, the Swedish office products group, swung to a SKr301m (Dollars
38.1m) pre-tax profit in 1993 from a SKr11m loss a year earlier, in spite of
weak conditions in many important markets. The dividend is SKr2.75 per
share, up from SKr2.50.
The turnround was flattered by the exclusion of SKr270m in one-off costs
which hit the final quarter of 1992. But improved market conditions in the
final quarter of 1993, particularly in the Nordic countries and the UK, also
helped. The company expects a further improvement this year.
The weaker krona was positive for the company, helping to lift sales to
SKr11.8bn from SKr9.9bn. However, the impact was mitigated by sizeable
production operations in hard currency countries such as Denmark, France,
Belgium and Germany.
Based on comparable exchange rates and units, sales were 3 per cent lower
last year, reflecting weak markets in southern and western Europe and Japan.

Losses at Puma, the German-based sports goods manufacturer which has been
reorganised, more than quintupled last year to DM68.8m (Dollars 39m)
compared with a DM12m loss in 1992.
The group blamed the costs of rationalisation measures. These gave rise to
extraordinary restructuring charges of DM60.5m at the parent company level.
Excluding licence income, turnover dropped by 11 per cent last year to
DM457.6m following DM512.8m in 1992. Including licence revenue, group
turnover rose by 1 per cent to DM1.18bn.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Pentagon bans smoking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After Britain's Royal Navy abandoned the rum ration, it was perhaps only a
matter of time before the US armed services stopped smoking.
That time came yesterday when the Pentagon announced a workplace smoking
ban.
The new policy will still allow soldiers and sailors to light up a cigarette
in designated areas of military barracks, clubs and restaurants, but will
rule out Pentagon offices and hallways, as well as the inside of a tank or
aircraft.
Smoking below the decks of US Navy ships has already been virtually
outlawed.
The armed forces have traditionally smoked much more than the population at
large, and despite aggressive steps to curb smoking, the rate of addiction
remains high.
Navy officials said around 37 per cent of Navy personnel were now smokers,
compared with around 27 per cent in the general US population.
The move was therefore welcomed by anti-smoking campaigners, who have been
pressing for tougher curbs on smoking in the wake of the Environmental
Protection Agency's recent decision to classify passive smoking as an
environmental hazard.
Some shopping malls and restaurant chains, including McDonald's, have banned
smoking on their premises, and legislation is being debated in Congress that
would bar cigarettes from all public buildings.
Tobacco companies also face scrutiny over reports that they add nicotine to
their products in order to maintain addiction - a charge that has led the
Food and Drug Administration to consider regulating cigarettes as a drug.
Justice Department officials are also conducting a monopoly investigation
into allegations that tobacco companies agreed to keep a cigarette which
presents less of a fire hazard off the market.
The tobacco industry, facing a steep increase in cigarette taxes as part of
US healthcare reforms, is not taking this lying down. Philip Morris, the
tobacco conglomerate, shut down one of its largest plants yesterday to bus
its workers to Washington to demonstrate against the tax rise.

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan cabinet yesterday sent a series of tax bills to Congress
aimed at cutting the public sector deficit, which last year reached 3.6 per
cent of gross domestic product.
The bills cover several areas. A general sales tax, covering imports and
other activities at the wholesale level, is planned to replace a value added
tax brought in in October 1993.
The maximum rate for corporate and personal income taxes is being raised
from 30 per cent to 34 per cent. At the same time the number of income tax
deductions is being reduced.
Two new taxes are being proposed: a levy on all debit transactions at banks
and a luxury tax of 10, 20 or 30 per cent, depending on classifications to
be issued by the government.
Venezuela's motor industry is bracing itself for lower sales, expecting the
luxury tax to raise prices considerably on its profitable, high-priced
vehicles.
The government is proposing some changes in existing tax laws, for example
lowering high fees established last year for certain government services and
introducing stricter penalties for tax evasion. It plans to set up an
independent agency to collect taxes and reduce tax evasion, put at 70 per
cent in recent years.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Belgrade theatregoers find a respite from the war: Cheap
tickets mean capacity audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huddled in scarves and overcoats, a Belgrade theatre audience intently
follows the argument between a grizzled Bosnian moneylender, played by one
of Serbia's leading actors, with an Austrian officer who wants to marry
Gago, his maid.
'The Girl with Purple Hair', set in a period of turmoil as the
Austro-Hungarian empire was collapsing, opened nearly a year ago, but
tickets are still hard to get.
Despite being shabby and unheated, Belgrade's theatres are playing to
capacity audiences for the second successive winter. With the price of a
theatre ticket still only the equivalent to buying a Coke at a Belgrade
disco, theatre is one of cheapest forms of entertainment.
Although Serbian actors and directors acquired a good reputation during the
1980s, it was only after the rump Yugoslavia was plunged into isolation by
UN sanctions 20 months ago because of the war in Bosnia that theatres
started filling up.
Mr Milan Vlajicic, arts editor of the Belgrade daily Politika, says: 'Most
people can't afford to frequent restaurants any more, and cheap theatre
tickets make it possible to have an evening out. But there's also a new,
younger audience for serious plays, just as there was during the second
world war.'
Few new films reach cinemas in Serbia and Montenegro. State-controlled
television dutifully reflects the growing nationalist influence in daily
life, showing war films during the conflict with Croatia two years ago and,
more recently, domestic soap operas with a discernibly Serb nationalist
slant in the dialogue and jokes.
Yet only one new play, 'Dark is the Night' by Alexander Popovic, Serbia's
best-known playwright, takes the war for its subject.
But for people who want to forget the grimness of daily life in the Serbian
capital, there are comedies, classics and musicals - Fiddler on the Roof and
Some Like it Hot are this season's hits.
'The Girl with Purple Hair', inspired by a short story of Ivo Andric, the
former Yugoslavia's Nobel prize-winning novelist, touches indirectly on
current issues.
Ms Vida Ognjenovic, who wrote and directed the piece, says: 'I wanted to
write something that was relevant to our problems, there was no question
about that. Even so, it had to be put in context and given some distance.'
Financial constraints mean that sets are minimal and costumes modest in
Serbian theatre productions. The costumes for 'Girl with Purple Hair' were
made from scraps of material which were collected from a leather factory
because the Belgrade municipal theatre, which staged the play, is close to
bankruptcy.
Concert tickets are also in short supply, although more than 150 of
Belgrade's leading orchestral musicians have left the country in the past
two years.
While there is no official censorship, the Socialist party of President
Slobodan Milosevic keeps a watchful eye on cultural activity.
The National Theatre, the umbrella for the former Yugoslavia's leading
theatre, ballet and opera companies, was placed under new management in 1992
after Ms Ognjenevoic, then its artistic director allowed Mr Vuk Draskovic,
the democratic opposition leader, to address his supporters from its balcony
in an anti-government demonstration.
When the municipal theatre staged a new play about St Sava, Serbia's patron
saint, which implied he had been a spoiled medieval playboy, nationalist
demonstrators disrupted the opening night.
The play was not performed again.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (12): Credit comes to judgment -
County court case registrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most effective ways of preventing bad debts from arising is to
carry out a thorough check on credit status before granting credit.
Information on the credit status of another company is readily available
from the main credit reference agencies such as CCN, Infolink, Dun 
Bradstreet and Equifax.
The service provided by these agencies has become increasingly sophisticated
in recent years, as the information required by businesses trying to assess
the risk of lending money, or supplying goods and services, has changed in
response to the changing economic environment.
Clients are much more specific about the information they want and what they
are prepared to pay for, says David Coates, sales and marketing director of
CCN Business Information.
Five years ago most users bought full status reports on companies. These
days, Mr Coates adds, the agencies have to break down reports and sell the
information in different forms.
The problem of judging the credit status of the 3m-4m businesses in the UK -
mainly partnerships and sole traders - on which no audited financial
information is available, has proved particularly acute during the
recession. It prompted CCN to develop a database for unlimited companies and
to begin adapting empirical scoring techniques long used in the consumer
credit field, to help evaluate the credit worthiness of businesses.
In addition to looking at an industry sector as a whole, the payment record
of a company and any available financial data, an essential element in
building up a picture of the creditworthiness of small businesses has been
the development of a directors' database.
CCN's directors' database contains information on 6m directors and company
secretaries in the UK. With so many business failures during the recession,
this information has proved invaluable in helping banks and other companies
decide whether to lend or extend credit to start up businesses where often
the only information available on which to make an assessment of the credit
risk relates to its directors.
Most agencies now offer their services through on line computer links. This
has made checking credit information quick and simple. Furthermore, it has
helped to reduce the cost to the end user. CCN charges Pounds 25 for a
traditional full status report, but for users such as banks (which purchase
the information in bulk) the cost of a full status report is discounted to
under Pounds 10. A directors' database search costs Pounds 6 and a search of
CCN's unlimited database costs Pounds 10. Prices charged by other agencies
are comparable.
The credit reference agencies' sources of information are Companies House,
newspapers and, quite often with small companies, the company itself. But
probably their most important source of information is county court
judgments.
Since 1990 most county court judgments are immediately entered on the County
Court Register as soon as made by a court.
Entries can be cancelled when a judgment is set aside or reversed or paid in
full within one month. Judgments paid in full after one month can be noted
on the register as 'satisfied'. All entries are automatically removed after
six years.
Since 1986 the register has been run by Registry Trust Ltd, a
non-profit-making company limited by guarantee. The Register is divided into
consumer judgments and commercial judgments against businesses.
According to Malcolm Hurlston, chairman of Registry Trust, users of the
register fall into one of four categories:
Purchasers of the consumer file;
Purchasers of the commercial file;
Purchasers of the file by county or by court;
Individual inquiries from the public, either by post or in person.
When the Trust took over the running of the register from the Lord
Chancellor's Department, it had a database of 6m pieces of paper and the
cost of searching a judgment was 40p each. Through computerisation and the
establishment of a dual system for keying-in the data, which has ensured the
accuracy of the information stored, the cost of accessing the register has
come down substantially. Purchasers of the whole file now pay the equivalent
of 16p for each judgment.
Purchasers of the file of commercial judgments - which make up 18.4 per cent
of the whole file - pay Pounds 64,000 per annum. The commercial file is
currently purchased by eight agencies. Purchasers of all the consumer
judgments pay Pounds 250,000 per annum. There are currently four purchasers
of the consumer file.
The number purchasing the information by locality or by court has fallen
from a low base of 30 in 1986 to just 8 in 1994. They pay 40p per judgment.
Public inquiries cost Pounds 4.50 by post and Pounds 4 in person. There were
54,155 public inquiries in 1993, a fall of 11 per cent on the 1992 figure
and some way below the peak of almost 70,000 in 1990.
In 1993 there were just over 2m judgments registered or noted as satisfied
on the register, a fall of 12 per cent on the 1992 figure - which in turn
was a fall on the peak figure of 2.4m in 1991.
The number of commercial judgments registered but unsatisfied on the
register in 1993 was 332,265, 16 per cent down on the peak 1992 figure of
almost 400,000.
Information on High Court judgments is not available at present but would be
useful if it could be accurately collated, says Aidan Breen, operations
director of CCN Business Information.
Gathering accurate information on High Court judgments is difficult, says
Malcolm Hurlston, partly because of the large number of cases which settle
out of court with the terms of settlement remaining secret.
At best, any body (such as the Trust) which now undertook to record High
Court judgments could only offer an incomplete picture. This would be of
doubtful value to the main users of such information: the credit reference
agencies.
Irrespective of whether or not accurate information on High Court judgments
becomes available in the short term, the scope of the information available
to credit reference agencies, and to others who need assistance in deciding
whether or not to lend or supply goods and services, is increasing all the
time. The register, for example, has been extended in recent years to cover
courts in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Jersey.
The agencies have begun to collect information on individual and company
schemes of voluntary arrangement (CCN will offer an information service on
company voluntary arrangements from March 17).
And through organisations such as Internet, a network of the main credit
bureaux in Europe, information on the credit status of European companies
can now be easily accessed by exporters anywhere within the EU.
All these developments help to make pre-credit checking an increasingly
attractive and effective way of preventing the problem of bad debts.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (11): 'I'm keen on the
embarrassment factor' - Late payers, watch out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Strathclyde, the youthful minister of state for small firms and
consumer affairs, enjoys the thought of embarrassing companies which fail to
pay their bills on time.
He is waging his own personal battle against late payers, who have been
accused of depriving British companies of more than Pounds 50bn in cash
through unpaid invoices. If he receives a complaint from a disgruntled
supplier, 'I will send a letter to the chairman (of the debtor company),' he
says. Of course, he adds, the debtor is given a fair hearing. But
nevertheless: 'I'm keen on the embarrassment factor.'
Debate over the solution to late payment is reaching fever pitch, with
responses to a consultative document on the subject issued by the Department
of Trade and Industry expected by the end of the month. The document
followed comments by the UK Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, in his November
budget, that failure to settle invoices on time could mean 'the difference
between survival and failure' for many UK companies.
Mr Philip Mellor, senior analyst with Dun  Bradstreet, says that in annual
surveys by the credit information provider, late payment has consistently
ranked in the top three concerns of companies questioned. The Confederation
of British Industry also found, in 1991, that one in five of its smaller
members thought their survival was threatened by late payment.
But the solution is less than clear. The proposal which sparked the most
controversy has been legislation to impose a statutory right to interest on
late payments. A survey of almost 500 smaller companies by SG Warburg, the
UK brokers, last month, showed that 58 per cent of those questioned favoured
legislation. But a substantial minority - 29 per cent - opposed legislation.
The campaign to introduce statutory interest has been backed by prominent
names including Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, and
Mr Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks  Spencer. They have all backed
proposals put forward by the Forum of Private Businesses, a vociferous lobby
group which has campaigned for legislation for about 10 years. The forum
suggests that, among other measures, companies be allowed to claim interest
on overdue invoices for up to six years, even if the main debt had been
separately collected.
Legislation, say its supporters, would end the uncertainty surrounding
payment, which plagues smaller businesses. This is particularly important,
as the economy begins to recover, to companies strapped for cash. 'We should
not allow those smaller companies, without assets to fall back upon, to be
penalised by late payment,' Mr Mellor says.
The Forum is unperturbed by sceptics who say that companies are unlikely to
pursue interest. Legislation with a six-year option would force late payers
to make provision for contingent liabilities in their accounts, says Mr
David Harrop, of the Forum. This would encourage late payers to improve
their performance.
While Lord Strathclyde himself admits that there appears to be a
considerable head of steam building up behind this option, the issue must
present a difficult dilemma for the Government. How can it increase
regulation while preaching deregulation?; When should interest charges begin
if the standard payment times vary, industry by industry? And how would the
already overloaded courts cope with an increase in cases? 'Legislation only
sounds simple if you say it quickly,' says Lord Strathclyde.
Opponents of legislation cite a variety of arguments against the proposal.
'Small companies owe money as well as are owed money,' says Mr Tim Corbett,
business development director of Barclays Commercial Services, the factoring
firm. ' If they owe money to their suppliers they will be targeted too, and
could find themselves on the losing side.'
Opponents argue that charging interest may well encourage late payment. Some
companies may decide interest provides a legitimate excuse for not paying
and 'use the supplier as an alternative source of finance,' says Mr Ben
Allen, chairman of the Association of British Factors and Discounters (see
profile, Page II).
Then there are those who cite the experience of those European countries
such as France and Germany, which have legislation, but where payment times
actually appear to be lengthening.
'I do not think legislation will make a blind bit of difference,' says Mr
John Butterworth, managing director of Royal Bank Invoice Finance, whose
parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland, actually supports legislation.
Mr Butterworth suggests that the best option would be to use the existing
system, which allows collection of interest through the courts if it has
been specified in the contract. This is a cumbersome and lengthy process,
which few companies use. The legislation being proposed would apply the
right to interest universally, irrespective of the contract. 'We would like
to avoid legislation if possible,' says Mr Mellor of Dun  Bradstreet, 'but
looking at all the voluntary measures that have been put forward to date,
none has worked.'
Opponents would argue that peer pressure has been effective with some of the
UK's largest companies. 'GEC was one of the worst offenders and they have
been shamed into changing their policies,' says Mr Allen of the ABFD.
He favours the DTI's second option - a British Standard on prompt payment,
as well as measures to force companies to publish their payment times in the
annual accounts.
Need for change is is about the only issue on which all parties agree. Yet
Lord Strathclyde is wary of even that seemingly simple goal. 'However you
change the climate of late payment, you must tackle the problem of financial
management within companies - in the UK it's appalling.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (12): Tide may turn on smart
devices - 'Personal digital assistants' have not yet caught on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The goal of the mobile communications industry is to keep you in touch 'any
time, anywhere'. Whether or not this is an attractive proposition, it seems
to be the inevitable fate of many professionals in the not-too-distant
future.
Already, many are toting a bag full of communications gadgets: a cellular
telephone, a pager and a notebook computer complete with telephone modem.
Combine the functions of these products into a single device and you have a
'personal communicator'.
It seemed a sure-fire winner, but so far personal communicator products,
also known as 'personal digital assistants', have created more publicity
than profits. In fact, they have been a dismal failure.
Apple Computer's Newton was the biggest letdown. Heralded as a product that
would 'change the way people live and work', it turned out to be a product
that changed little except the names of the top management executives at
Apple. Tandy's Zoomer and ATT's Eo Communicator have also been slow
sellers.
Yet it may be too soon to write off the personal communicator. Advances in
wireless data communications and software for personal communicators promise
to make the next generation of these hand-held devices far more attractive
than the first.
Apple Computer is set to introduce a new version of Newton with improved
communications capabilities and better handwriting recognition software.
ATT, stung by the disappointing sales of the Eo Communicator, is
redesigning the system, lowering the price and transforming it into a mobile
telephone with computer features.
IBM is said to be planning a family of personal communicator products, each
designed for specific tasks. One model, for example, is equipped with voice
recognition for dictating notes. Another is designed for sending and
receiving electronic mail.
Motorola is about to enter the market with a personal communicator called
Envoy that has a built-in modem to send data both over telephone lines and
over the Ardis network. Jointly owned by Motorola and International Business
Machines, Ardis provides wireless data messaging service in all large US
metropolitan areas. Sony is also planning to launch a personal communicator
in the US this summer.
Link Resources, a US market research group, predicts a 45.7 per cent
compound annual growth rate in sales of all types of 'smart hand-held
devices' over the next five years, with more than 5m units being shipped to
business users and consumers in the US in 1998. The second generation of
personal communicators will sell well to mobile executives and in the small
office and home office markets, Link researchers predict. They anticipate
several developments that could turn the tide for this new category of
mobile communications devices. Most importantly, the market researchers
expect wireless data communications services to proliferate and become less
expensive.
At present, Ardis, a joint venture of Motorola and IBM, and Ram Mobile Data,
owned by BellSouth and RAM Broadcasting, offer wireless data networks in
large cities throughout the US.
This year new Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) and enhanced 'specialised
mobile radio' (SMR) services - based on the networks being implemented by
McCaw Cellular and NexTel - will drive down user costs for wireless voice
and data communications, Link Resources predicts.
CDPD sends data in packets over cellular networks. 'In the simplest sense,
this technology sends blocks of information over the networks by utilising
those milliseconds when channels are idle between calls,' said Brian
Montgomery, of Cellular One, a California cellular telephone service company
that is a joint venture of McCaw Cellular and Pacific Telesis. 'It provides
the capability for a cost-effective data service because it doesn't require
expanded system capacity.'
An important advantage of CDPD is that it is an 'open' standard, developed
by a consortium of communication companies including McCaw Cellular
Communications and PacTel Cellular, based on non-proprietary technology.
This means that unlike existing wireless networks, it will be accessible to
anyone with a computer or personal communicator equipped with a CDPD modem
and that it can be integrated easily with existing software for applications
such as electronic mail. Lotus Development, the personal computer software
company, is developing software to take advantage of CDPD networks.
NexTel, a little-known six-year-old New Jersey radio dispatch service
company, burst on to the scene as a potential new competitor in the emerging
market for wireless data communications last year with its acquisition of
mobile radio spectrum rights from Motorola. Using digital technology from
Motorola, NexTel aims to create a nationwide network offering voice, data
and paging as well as its established dispatch services .
When low cost wireless data communications services are in place, personal
communicators will become really useful devices, enabling people to send or
receive written (or typed) messages, access information services or simply
use the device as a portable telephone.
Another important impetus for personal communicators may be 'intelligent
networks' such as ATT's 'PersonaLink'. Using software developed by General
Magic, a California software company in which it holds a stake, ATT plans
to introduce 'PersonaLink' this summer.
Among the features of PersonaLink is the ability to prioritise messages.
Perhaps more than anything else this may prove to be the 'must have'
attraction of personal communicators for people who are overwhelmed with
telephone, facsimile and electronic mail messages.
Instead of exacerbating this all-too-common problem by creating 'anywhere,
anytime' communications, personal communicators may actually therefore help
individuals to regain control of their personal communications.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (14): Superhighway into the home
 -Efforts to turn couch potatoes into couch commandos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The computer, telecommunications and entertainment industries are conspiring
to turn 'couch potatoes' into 'couch commandos'; to rouse television viewers
from their passive stupor and to get them 'interacting' with the tube.
Interactive television will be the foundation of a Dollars 3,500bn digital
consumer electronics industry by the turn of the century, John Sculley, the
former chairman of Apple Computer, has predicted. The prospect is sparking a
frenzy of activity among US telephone, cable television, entertainment,
computer, software and semiconductor companies.
Hollywood and High Tech are joining forces to promote I-TV. It 'will usher
in the multimedia age, inaugurating the electronic superhighway into the
home,' enthuses Gerald Levin, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner,
the entertainment group.
'This is the 'information infrastructure' that President Clinton has talked
about,' says Richard McCormick, chairman and chief executive of US West, one
of the largest US regional telephone companies, which plans to expand its
services to include I-TV.
The multi-billion dollar question, however, is whether consumers will share
the industry's excitement about technology that transforms the living room
TV set into a 'digital interactive multimedia terminal'.
Today, fledgling I-TV services offer viewers the chance to participate in
television game shows, to call football plays before the quarterback makes
his move, order movies for instant viewing and register their opinions on
issues of the day. But is this enough to 'change the use of television' as
industry proponents maintain?
Future plans include interactive shopping channels. Picking fashions from
Nordstrom, or home furnishings from Macy's could soon become as simple as
pressing a few buttons on the remote control.
There are also grand plans for multi-media information services ranging from
restaurant guides complete with video footage of the dining-room and a
nutritional analysis of the menu, to maps that can display the most scenic
route or locations of inns along the way.
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of I-TV, however, is the prospect of
being able to design your own TV channel, selecting all your favourite shows
and programmes reflecting your interests. You might, for example, want to
watch only a re-run of Cheers, or all news broadcasts concerning the war in
Bosnia.
But with so many different potential uses for I-TV, there is little
consensus on what are the 'killer applications' that will lure consumers to
pay for this new technology.
Games will be the 'Trojan Horse' that bring I-TV into the home, providing an
entree for information services, movies-on-demand, TV shopping and other
services, analysts at Salomon Brothers predict. 'Consumers simply are not
willing to invest the money . . . for any application but games and
'edutainment',' they say.
However, extensive consumer research conducted by Hewlett-Packard suggests
that educational applications of interactive television, aimed at children,
may be the initial attraction.
'Consumers are very shrewd. They realise that although games may have some
novelty value they are not going to hold their interest for long,' says
Casey Lumus, HP's interactive television market development manager. She
wonders, however, whether the 4,000 participants in HP's surveys, interviews
and focus groups may have been giving a 'morally correct' answer by putting
education at the top of their list of most interesting applications.
There is a widespread suspicion among market researchers that I-TV could
take off on a different note. They point out that pornographic films
established the Dollars 12bn video rentals business and that on-line romance
is a key attraction of computer information services. The same may be true
of I-TV.
While identifying the services that will persuade consumers to pay for I-TV
is difficult, market researchers have a clearer picture of what consumers do
not want. Of more than 3,000 people interviewed by H  M Consulting, a
California market research firm, 94 per cent said they wanted no
solicitation on I-TV and 73 per cent said no to advertising.
Consumers are afraid of the 'Big Brother' factor. 'They fear that their
interaction habits - what they purchase, which programmes they watch and
which information services they access - will be monitored by service
providers to target advertising at them,' explains Mark Macgillivray of H 
M.
This poses a huge problem, because advertising is the primary source of
revenue for the TV industry. Although advertisers relish the idea of being
able to target consumers who are likely to buy their products, it seems that
they will have to create new forms of advertising such as 'infomercials' to
catch their attention.
HP's researchers also found that consumers are concerned that I-TV will make
TV shopping too easy, leading to impulse buying. 'A surprisingly high number
of consumers said that they already 'couldn't trust' family members with
home shopping TV channels which require a phone call to order goods,' notes
Ms Lumus. 'What would happen if they could spend money just by punching a
button on a remote control?' HP's research subjects asked.
The biggest question hanging over I-TV, however, is whether people will find
the time to use it. Initial response from viewers offered 'movie-on-demand'
service has been mixed, with most consumers making little use of it.
In addition to the uncertainties of consumer response, several economic,
regulatory and technical obstacles stand in the way of widespread
availability of interactive television services.
Delivering interactive TV to the home will require huge investments in
optical fibre cables capable of carrying hundreds of different TV signals as
well as computers to control the interactive network and store massive
quantities of data for multi-media information services. Viacom, one of the
largest US cable TV operators, estimates the total industry's costs at more
than Dollars 30bn.
Cable TV and telephone companies are vying for the role of I-TV providers,
yet neither industry has networks that are well suited to the task. While
telephone networks have the two-way communication capability and
sophisticated switching systems needed for I-TV, they lack the broad band
width needed for hundreds of video signals. Cable TV networks have higher
capacity, although most will need to be upgraded for I-TV, and they are not
designed for two-way communications.
Regulatory barriers limit the activities of US telephone companies. While
the Clinton administration is backing legislation that will enable 'open
competition' in telephone and television services, many details have yet to
be worked out.
There are, as yet, no technical standards for interactive television. Early
purchasers could get stuck with the I-TV equivalent of a Betamax; the losing
contender in the video tape recording standards battle. Similarly, cable TV
operators risk choosing the wrong method of video compression, which
squeezes hundreds of digitised TV signals down a single cable.
I-TV faces competition from alternative 'interactive multimedia' products.
3DO, a Silicon Valley start-up company backed by ATT, Matsushita and Time
Warner, has launched a Dollars 700 'multimedia player' and CD-ROM
interactive programmes for PCs have multiplied the sales of PCs to home
users.
None of this has dimmed the enthusiasm of the high technology and
entertainment industries, which are banding together in a multitude of
cross-industry partnerships and alliances to position themselves for the
brave new world of I-TV. .
Among the key players, Tele-Communication and Time Warner, the two largest
US cable TV operator with a total of over 17m subscribers, are 'both
committed to transforming our cable systems into powerful networks that will
deliver a broad array of services,' says John Malo , president and chief
executive of TCI. The companies have formed a joint venture to develop
standard hardware and software for interactive TV networks.
Time Warner Entertainment and TCI are also partnering Sega America, the US
subsidiary of the Japanese video games manufacturer, to launch 'The Sega
Channel', offering Sega video game owners access to a large library of games
via cable television.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (13): Life in tomorrow's fast
lane - Louise Kehoe discusses convergence of computers with television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Convergence has become the buzzword of the US high-technology industries as
telephone, cable television, computer and software companies all work toward
creating high-speed, broadband 'information highways' linking homes, offices
and schools.
The notion that these formerly distinct industries are melding into a giant
'information industry' has been buoyed by a plethora of partnerships and
alliances that criss-cross industry segments.
Yet it is fierce competition, rather than a meeting of minds, that is
driving rapid changes in the US communications sector and the results, at
least in the short term, may be more chaotic than cohesive.
US telephone companies are engaged in a huge battle with the cable
television industry. Similarly, the personal computer industry is pitted
against the makers of TV sets, broadcasters and all who place their bets on
TV as the primary vehicle for delivering multimedia services to the home.
As author George Gilder puts it: 'The computer industry is converging with
the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with
the horse.' He predicts a period of 'creative destruction' as industry
segments collide and battle over establishing their new roles.
There will be 'winnowing out' of many of the early participants in the rush
to create interactive multimedia communications services, predicts Bill
Gates, chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company, which this year is investing Dollars 100m - a
quarter of its research and development budget - in software for multimedia
communications services.
Just building the infrastructure for this high-speed information transport
system could cost as much as Dollars 100bn, Mr Gates estimates. Yet no one,
including the companies making these investments, really knows how the
market will develop, he warns.
This is especially evident in the transmission segment where telephone and
cable TV companies are spending heavily to upgrade networks. Due to progress
in technology and differing assumptions about customer demand, a variety of
approaches to modernisation have evolved.
To increase the capacity of networks, telephone companies are investing in
optical fibre cables. Debate continues, however, on whether the optical
fibre needs to run all the way to the kerb, serving perhaps a dozen homes,
or to neighbourhood 'hubs' serving hundreds of homes.
While Bell Atlantic, for example, favours fibre to the kerb, Pacific Bell
has adopted a 'hybrid fibre coaxial cable' approach in which fibre-optic
loops link to coaxial cables that feed telephone and TV signals to groups of
homes. US West plans to employ a combination of the two.
Cable TV companies already have coaxial cable networks in place to serve
more than 60 per cent of households. Over short distances, with digital
compression, coaxial cables rival the capacity of optical fibre, but like
the telephone companies, the cable industry must upgrade to fibre for longer
hauls. Many of the larger cable TV companies are now upgrading to hybrid
networks with optical fibre links to neighbourhoods, then coaxial cable to
individual homes.
The limitation of the cable TV networks, however, is that they were designed
for one-way, point-to-multi-point communications, whereas true interactive
television will require switching systems, more like the telephone network.
Thus the cable TV industry also faces huge costs.
Another drawback of the cable television networks is that they generally
cover only a small area - one town or city - and are not interconnected. How
this problem will be resolved remains unclear.
Even as the communications 'pipe layers' continue their preparation for the
advent of interactive multimedia communications services, the personal
computer and television industries are involved in a parallel battle.
Intel, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips used in personal
computers, maintains that personal computers will be the primary 'conduit'
on to the information superhighway. 'PC technology is advancing far more
rapidly than television technology,' says Avram Miller of Intel. ' Already,
30 per cent of US homes have personal computers. How long will it take for
interactive television to reach that level?'
While most discussions of the information highway focus on the notion of 500
channels of interactive cable TV being piped into living rooms, Intel
believes that business use of video conference and multimedia information
services, delivered via the PC screen, will take off first, with
applications for the home trailing by at least two years.
While competition between industry sectors expands, it is already intense
within established industry segments. As many as a dozen companies, for
example, are vying for position in the market for TV set top terminals -
electronic boxes that will sit on top of the television decoding and
transmitting two-way signals.
Computer companies are already elbowing each other in the emerging market
for 'video servers'; electronic juke boxes that will store and retrieve
films, television programmes or video clips for 'on demand' services.
Oracle, the leading database software company, has paired with nCube, a
manufacturer of massively parallel supercomputers, in a bid to lead the
video server market. But International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard
also have their eyes on this prize market. Sales of video servers are
expected to surge to Dollars 5.1bn by 1997, from just Dollars 16m last year,
according to Dataquest.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has developed video server software that will run on
networked personal computers that sell for a fraction of the cost of a
mainframe computer or supercomputer. The intense competition surrounding the
implementation of 'information superhighways' is probably the surest sign
that this technology vision will soon become reality. Rather than a
'convergence' of industries, however, it seems likely to involve the
invasion of established industry sectors by ambitious newcomers. For all
industry participants, keeping pace with rapid change will be essential to
success.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (10): Companies recognise the
connection - Christine Tighe profiles Nicholas Wilson, the first professor
of credit management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Nicholas Wilson, the first holder of the Institute of Credit
Management's (ICM) newly created chair at Bradford university, has clear
objectives.
He seeks to raise the profile of credit management as an academic discipline
and as a vital function within companies. His task is to launch an extensive
programme of research in credit management, developing its profile in the
academic curriculum and professional training and attracting talented young
people to work in the area.
To some extent, his appointment last summer was in itself a significant step
forward; he believes he is the first professor of credit management not just
in the UK but in the world.
The subject draws from various disciplines, including economics, finance and
information technology (IT). 'My function is to bring them together into a
credit management discipline,' he says. 'It is an exciting area, fairly new,
with a lot of developments. It is coming to be seen as a critical function,
whether you are talking about a small business or a multinational body.'
His own background includes an undergraduate degree in industrial economics,
followed by a PhD thesis on participation and profit sharing in British
engineering; research fellowships in West Berlin's Wissenschaftzentrum and
at Warwick University; and a nine year stint as a lecturer at Bradford
Management Centre in managerial economics. He is now 37.
It may seem a long way from small companies' unglamorous but persistent
worries about recalcitrant late payers to Nicholas Wilson's high flying
academic career and his ambitious use of powerful computer neural networks
to produce predictive modelling tools for credit risk. But companies'
initial response to his work suggests that they see the connection.
There has been an excellent response to a research project he recently set
up, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), to collect
new empirical evidence on small companies' working capital management policy
and practices. Of the 100-strong pilot group approached, 35 per cent
responded with full information. Astonishingly - or perhaps not, if you are
familiar with the preoccupations of small businesses - some respondents said
they spend 85 per cent of their time managing cash flow and chasing debts.
'If you look at figures on failure, it's largely because of cash flow
problems in the small business sector,' says Prof Wilson. 'A number of
things could help - more prompt payments by larger businesses, better
understanding by the banking sector of the difficulties small businesses
face, and more training in cash flow management.'
Further research launched since his appointment has also found companies
willing to co-operate. But he believes there is still a long way to go to
achieve his broad aim of raising credit management's status.
'There's an image that the credit manager is somebody who chases debts and
that's it - an internal process in the organisation,' he says. 'But that's
far from the truth. Credit managers are business analysts; they're closer to
the business than anybody else.'
Credit management, he says, should now be part of the structure of an
organisation, and should begin before an account is opened. 'That is why
credit risk modelling has to be more sophisticated, to try to profile risks
and understand them.' This does not necessarily mean that credit will
ultimately be withheld; rather that it is given on a better informed basis.
In some companies the credit management arm is jokily known as the sales
prevention team - and yet this should be far from the case. 'It facilitates
business rather than preventing it.'
In order to produce the more sophisticated predictive tools he has in mind,
Prof Wilson is leading research on the modelling of corporate distress and
failure, both by devising statistical models and by using neural network
computer systems which can predict outcomes, such as credit risk categories,
on the basis of recognising patterns in the information fed in. PhD students
with backgrounds in mathematics, finance and accountancy are co-operating on
this neural network research, funded by the ESRC.
He has also instigated research into trade credit, both as a form of short
term financing and a source of competitive advantage - an area of academic
study he considers relatively neglected.
The research will examine why and when non-financial sector companies use
trade credit, how they establish terms and how they manage these activities.
Initial data is available from companies' own accounting information and
from Companies House, but Prof Wilson plans to begin building up from next
month a sample of 1,000 companies willing to co-operate in an annual
monitoring exercise which will be sustained over a number of years.
Other research projects include study of the survival and performance of new
start-ups in West Yorkshire, and the Working Capital Management study (which
unearthed the would-be entrepreneurs who spend 85 per cent of their time on
cash flow management).
Research, however, is only one part of Nicholas Wilson's brief. After
Easter, the current year's MBA intake at Bradford Management Centre will be
able to opt for a module in credit risk management. Out of about 100
students on this year's MBA, at least 15 have so far signed up for the
subject.
And from next academic year, undergraduates will be able to include a module
in credit management in their courses. Because Bradford's degrees are
modular in structure, students from a wide range of disciplines will be able
to take this option.
Prof Wilson will also be laying on, at the Bradford Management Centre, short
executive courses on techniques and new developments in credit management.
The first of these seminars, aimed at those already working in the field,
will be held for two days in November. Bradford, he says, was an appropriate
choice for the ICM chair because the management centre has an excellent
reputation both for the quality of its research and for its practical
orientation.
The centre's clients include Unilever, Allied Lyons, Rolls-Royce, Ford and
the BBC - and Bradford was the first university to establish a chair in
Total Quality Management.
The Institute of Credit Management chair has been created initially for five
years, at an annual cost of Pounds 50,000. A number of sponsors, including
3M, Cork Gully, Dun  Bradstreet, and Infolink, are each contributing Pounds
5,000 for the first five years. The ICM hopes that, thereafter, the post
will have become so well established that Bradford University will absorb it
within its own structure.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (9): Powerhouse capability to
deliver - Information Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of information technology has now permeated almost every stage of
the credit management cycle, from application vetting through to litigation.
At the start of the cycle a large number of companies provide on-line
assessments of credit worthiness in the trade finance and consumer sectors.
Clients are demanding information in more user friendly forms.
For example, UAPT-Infolink has just launched Prophet, a Windows-based
package. Data is downloaded on to a client pc from Infolink's mainframes and
can then be fully manipulated using the full range of Windows' facilities,
including graphical interfaces. 'We're giving them full remote processing
capability,' says Mr Kevin Still, Infolink's head of marketing.
From the mid-1980s the UK's credit information providers started to tie
their computer systems into those of important clients. News about a
particular customer can be fed straight into a client's database on demand.
'For our very large customers we can build direct links into our database
and give them unlimited access,' says Mr Chris Brooker, distribution and
marketing director at Dun  Bradstreet.
Alternatively, rather than providing information on request, credit
information on customer files in client databases can be continuously
updated. 'It's really a question of giving them a seamless system,' says Mr
David Pearce, director of computer service development at Graydon Ltd, a
trade finance information provider.
Scoring systems are one of the most high-profile uses of IT within the
credit management function. They are mainly used to vet consumer credit
applications - though use in trade finance is growing - with points awarded
for key factors such as how long applicants have been in residence at their
current addresses, whether spouses are in employment and so on. Fair Isaac
developed the technique in the US back in 1958. Other suppliers of score
cards are CCN, MDS and Mathtec, with bureau services available from Equifix,
Scorex and UAPT-Infolink.
Building credit score cards is no longer the preserve of external experts.
Paragon Business Solutions has been marketing DSS, a pc-based package for
in-house score card building, for over two years.
Ms Caroline Hendra, head of personal credit at the Co-op bank, has used DSS
to build an application scorecard for a Visa gold card and to predict
response for a personal loan product. She also uses external consultants,
but is clear on the need for in-house building: 'As life becomes more
complicated you need to react more quickly.' Scorex can also supply building
software and SAS Institute Ltd will assist with development tools.
About 10 years after developing credit score carding, Fair Isaac began to
aggregate data drawn off customers' files after credit had been granted. The
resulting behaviour score cards enable companies to decide, for example,
whether to increase a client's credit limit or to renew a facility.
It is only in recent years that behaviour scoring has really taken off, on
the back of computers' advances in power and agility. 'It has big IT
applications,' says Mr O D Nelson, senior vice president at Fair Isaac.
'There can be 150 characteristics on a rich customer file to bring into a
decision making algorithm.' About two thirds of bank credit cards now have
account details analysed by behaviour scoring.
Mr Ian Arthur, an associate partner with Andersen Consulting, points to the
way in which sophisticated relational databases are increasingly built into
operational systems, linking and exploiting information across customer
files for different credit products. 'You can be more focused in the
marketing you do,' he says. Behaviour scores are combined with other data to
assess a customer's likelihood of buying a new product.
Use of expert systems is growing. A scorecard predicts customers' future
actions on the basis of past behaviour. Expert systems are built by
extracting the rules underlying credit professionals' decisions and building
systems that apply them automatically. Use has expanded beyond application
vetting to decide, for example, whether to authorise unusually large
transactions.
Neural networks are the next stage. Rules built into expert systems can only
be changed externally, but neural networks alter them on the basis of
experience. According to Mr Darren Whobery, new technology consultant at
UAPT-Infolink, neural networks have a slight edge in many applications. The
gap widens if there is more data available, particularly if it contains
variables with non-linear relationships.
Neural networks are already in use in the US. They are often coupled with
more conventional technology in hybrid systems, and are creeping into the
UK. 'It's only a question of time,' says Mr Arthur. UAPT-Infolink is being
sponsored by a club of big UK financial institutions, to evaluate neural
networks against score cards and expert systems.
The final stage of the credit process is, of course, collection. Systems
have been available for this end of the cycle for over 10 years and have
been particularly useful in the recession and its aftermath. Cases can be
put on a priority list for pursuit, according to rules laid down by users.
As part of pre-litigation processes, packages can now help users decide
whether to pursue a debt in-house, use an external collection agent or go to
the courts. They can issue letters of reminder and warnings before
initiating County Court and High Court proceedings.
Sanderson CFL markets two packages in this area. Tallyman deals with arrears
and collections, while the wonderfully named Minder (Monitored Integrated
Debt Recovery) assists recovery and litigation. 'We've done very well out of
it,' says Sanderson's Ms Sharon McBean, of the latter.
The packages are suitable for clients handling at least 10,000 debtors.
Current users include banks, building societies and utilities. Other
suppliers of software in this area include Target Computer Group, AST
TransAct (part of SHL Systemhouse Europe Group), AIM Law Data and Law Data
Systems.
Credit Collection Systems Ltd offers a bureau-type service to companies
wanting an in-house collection system without a large capital outlay. 'We
take care of all the hardware and software,' says sales manager Mr Richard
Brooks. Users access a central processing installation through terminals,
and payment is on the basis of each account put on the system.
Computers can deal with administration of undefended cases, but with
defended actions the role of IT in the credit management cycle ends. As Mr
Brooks points out, computers cannot yet walk into court and argue a case:
'There's no way you can take it that far.'
